Undaunted by their army, Sun Wukong calls them out, prompting the nephew of the Jade Emperor, Erlang Shen, to meet him in combat.",
    "h2_content": "Leaving the Shrine behind, you can round the corner to find two lesser Wolf Guais, a Swordsworn, and a new Wolf Soldier. The latter is armed with a shield, and can sometimes deflect your attacks to knock you off-balance. When this happens, watch for his counter and dodge at the last moment. A perfect dodge will slow down time and create an after-image of the Destined One, which lets you get in close for your own counter, and raises your Focus.\nCrossing the bridge will lead to a much more open section of this region. While Black Myth: Wukong is a fairly linear adventure, you will find that areas sometimes open up to allow for a bit more exploration off the beaten path, which can be essential for finding unique items and optional boss encounters.\nDefeat the next shield bearing Wolf Soldier down the road, and then another Wolf Stalwart guarding a **Purple Lingzhi** Mushroom you can harvest at the foot of a large tree. At this point, you’re likely to gain your first level up, giving you a “**Spark** ”.\nThese are essentially Skill Points, which you can begin investing in a large number of different Skill Trees. These can include general skills, or ones that relate to specific combat stances. Your Smash stance has already been unlocked, but you can also unlock two other stances that have unique heavy attacks by investing skill points in them.\nWhen the path leads down, you’ll be able to head right to proceed to a mini-boss, or go left along the stream leading back to the bridge you crossed earlier.\nGoing left should lead you to another Wolf Swordsworn behind a rock sculpture, and a **Gentian** plant near him that you can harvest.\nFurther down by the stream, you can spy a curious sight - a small Rat Guai will be looking around a small stone statue head at the end of the stream, before scurrying out of sight. If you go to check out what he was interacting with, you can touch the stone head to gain the **Skandha of Form** Key Item. Its purpose isn’t known just yet, but might be worth hanging onto…\nHead upstream to find another Purple**Lingzhi** by a broken tree, and two Wolf Scouts off to the right of the stream guarding a **Gentian** plant.\nWhere the stream widens and is full of more statue heads, you’ll encounter a few Frog Guai called a Croaky. They will hop toward you with sword in hand, and pause in midair before slicing forward, giving you a clear moment to dodge around them and counter. Just be sure you back away after killing one, as they’ll explode on death with poison gas.\nHarvest the **Jade Lotus** in the water before moving up toward the bridge you crossed earlier. On the other side of the bridge, the top of the stream is home to a lone Crow Diviner Yaoguai. He’s a lot tougher than the wolves, and can quickly slash with his reverse blade, either in a dashing strike, or a quick two-hit combo followed by a delayed third strike. The Crow can also jump up and slash down with powerful legs swipes, so be on guard to dodge around before getting your strikes in.\nHe’ll give a lot more experience and Will when defeated, and you can also loot a **Purple Lingzhi** on the left. On the right you can spot green wisps that denote wandering yaoguai spirits, but trying to gather them will only cause the wisps to fly off, giving you a fraction of their Will.\nHead back to the forest hill road, and this time make your way right to encounter your first mini-boss, a Yaoguai Chief.\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Bullguard\nAs your first real boss encounter, you should be prepared for big hits that can take a chunk out of your health, so it’s not a bad idea to make sure you’ve rested up and refilled your healing gourd before taking him on.\nThe Bullguard swings a mean halberd, which he can use to perform devastating overhand slams, and much quicker horizontal slashes that swing twice before a third overhead attack. Luckily, each of these combo hits usually end with him taking a long time to pull his weapon back out of the ground and reset his positioning, which is the perfect time to strike with a light combo or sneak in a heavy attack when he’s recovering.\nHe can also perform multiple overhead swings at once ending with a massive jump attack, so it’s safe to assume that unless he’s charging at you, his swings will almost always come out in multiple hits, and you’ll want to be ready to dodge them all first before you move in and attack.\nOnce you carve out about half of the Bullguard’s health bar, he’ll parry your next strike and move in for the killing blow — until the Keeper intervenes. Using an immobilization spell to lock him in place, the Keeper will pass on the magic spell to the Destined One, giving you your first spell - **Immobilize**!\nImmobilize allows you to bind an enemy in place for a small duration, at which point you’re able to make use of the pause to unload with attacks until the effect breaks. Stronger enemies like this Yaoguai Chief will break out a lot sooner than regular foes, and certain bosses can even resist it entirely, so be wary!\nOnce the Bullguard breaks free and the Keeper vanishes, it will be up to you to finish the fight. Utilize your new Immobilize Spell to bind him when it suits you best — either to ward off an incoming attack, catch your breath so you can heal, or use the moment to hit him from the side, and launch a heavy attack to send him sprawling.\nDon’t get too reckless, as the Immobilize Spell has a moderate cooldown, and uses a bit of your magic meter each time. Unlike your health or stamina, you can’t regenerate magic except by resting at a Shrine.\nWhen the beast finally falls, you’ll likely get a ton of experience, which you can invest in more skill trees that include a new one for your spells like Immobilize. The path forward is now clear to tread, but it’s still a little ways to the next Shrine. If you’re low on health, you can always head back to the Shrine and rest, as enemies like the Bullguard won’t respawn.\nBullguard\nPast the wooden gate the Bullguard was blocking, you’ll find another forested area with a sloping path up to the left. If you want to explore a bit first, head to the right to find a Wolf and some **Purple Lingzhi** , and a small pool of water where two Croaky enemies wait alongside some **Jade Lotus**.\nTaking the path up to the left, be ready to deal with a few more Wolf Scouts and Swordsworns. Grab the **Aged Ginseng** by a stone pillar as the path curves right.\nPast another Wolf, you’ll come upon the top of the path where a large wooden balcony overlooks the temple below. There’s a small orange pillow you can interact with to activate a **Meditation Spot**. Each chapter has a few of these, and resting at one will grant you a **free Spark Skill Point**\nThe Arbor, Forest of Wolves Meditation Spot\nBe sure to also look around near the wooden balcony for pots to smash for free Will, and a **Gentian** plant to gather.\nOpposite the balcony, you can spot some torches marking a tunnel passage into the rocks. Delve inside to find a familiar golden trail leading to the next Shrine. Now that you’ve grown, so to has the Shrine’s options, as you’ll be able to set Spells to your quickbar, reset your Skill Tree if you wish to experiment, and start buying and selling things at the store:\nBlack Wind Mountain Shrine Store\n---\nEvil Repelling Medicament (x3) - 270 Will | Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Antimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will |\nYarn (x4) - 300 Will | Stone Spirit (x4) - 450 Will | |\nAged Ginseng (x5) - 90 Will | Purple Lingzhi (x5) - 90 Will | Gentian (x5) - 90 Will | Jade Lotus (x5) - 90 Will\nSnake-Head Mushroom (x5) - 120 Will | | |\nSince you can’t craft medicine yet, you probably don’t need to be buying ingredients, but the medicines offered here are fairly rare to find in this chapter, so it won’t hurt to buy a few of each, and then sell any Pieces of Gold you’ve found.",
