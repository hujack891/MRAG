Both monks apparently aided an Elder named Jinchi to burn down the temple and the monk within alive — but that’s not all they share: Just up the sloping stairway path to the left of the way forward, you can find a second large bell that you can ring. Something ominous seems to be responding to the sound of these bells.\nLook for a way forward beyond a small archway to the side of the boss arena, and climb the winding stairs to follow a trail of gold leading to the next Shrine.\n### Marsh of the White Mist\nThis next area is a fairly quick one, but it’s also very important for a few different reasons. Before moving on from the Shrine, be sure to look across from it for a tall tree with yellow flowers hanging from it, and gather the ‘’’Luojia Fragrant Vine’’’.\nAs you head down the path from the Shrine, you’ll come upon a lone Snake Patroller harassing a fellow monkey who is hanging from the branches above. Teach the snake a lesson by dodging his lunging bite and then finishing him off. Doing so will award you a lot of loot, including the ‘’’Gall Gem’’’, which you’ll learn more about very soon.\nFollow the friendly Shen Monkey inside to the cave on the right, and you’ll find that he’s a merchant of gourds, drinks, and brews! Be sure to check all of his options out:\n* Upgrade Gourds - By using the Luojia Fragrant Vine you just found by the nearby Shrine, you upgrade the charges in your Old Gourd from 4 swings to 5, turning into a Medicine Gourd, and giving you more uses of its healing properties.\n* Upgrade Drinks - The default drink stored in your healing Gourd is Coconut Wine, which restores a third of your health for each swig. Once you find Awaken Wine Worms, return to him and you’ll be able to upgrade the amount healed with each use!\n* Brew - With your equipped Drink, you can enhance it by adding a Soak to increase additional effects beyond the heal. You can try it out now by adding the Gall Gem, which will increase your poison resistance in addition to the heal from your Gourd.\n* Store - If the Gall Gem isn’t all that enticing, be sure to check his shop, as the Shen Monkey sells **Celestial Lotus Seeds** , which can be used as an alternative Soak that continues to recover some health after the gourd’s initial heal!\nOnce you’re done chatting with the Shen Monkey, be sure to look near the wooden scaffolding ledge by a large statue, and absorb a green wisp spirit to earn a bunch of Will. You can drop down below for a shortcut down the main path along with a Snake-Head Mushroom, but there’s one more thing to grab outside first.\nExit the cave with the Shen Monkey and cross the wooden platform where you fought the Snake Patroller to the other side. In a small building on the far side, you can find a large chest that holds 2 **Tiny Piece of Gold** and 2 **Stone Spirit**.\nWhen you’re ready to move on, make sure you’re fully healed up from dealing with that snake, as the end of this downward path leads to the titular marsh where a very strong boss waits to block your path.",
