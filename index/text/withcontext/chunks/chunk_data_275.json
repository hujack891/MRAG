    "h2_content": "Now that you've cleaned up the majority of the optional bosses, it's time to find the last of the main bosses. You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis.\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Emerald-Armed Mantis\nZhu Bajie will be on the floor and pick up a mantis from the ground. It will hop inside Bajie's mouth, and you'll need to do the same to be able to fight the insect. You'll soon be transformed and literally entering the belly of the beast.\nNote! If you die here, you'll be automatically transported back to near Zhu Bajie. There's a nearby Mantis-Catching Swamp that can also be activated, just behind where Bajie stands against the tree. To get back inside him, approach him and talk to him.\nBecause the fight takes place inside Bajie's stomach, the area is limited. You'll find the mantis hacking and slashing away at the lining of Bajie's stomach, and it will soon turn its attention to you.\nThe first thing to take note of is the two blades it has for arms. It will use this to perform a combo of melee attacks, which mainly start with it raising both blades and stabbing them down into the pool of stomach contents you'll be wading through. As the blades land, this is a moment of vulnerability for the mantis, that will allow you to attack.\nIt will then start to use one blade at a time, and start to slash away. Occasionally, this will see the mantis spin around in a circle with the blades doing the same.\nIt's only when the mantis' health bar drops to around 70% that the fight changes drastically. A cutscene will  and the mantis will sharpen its blades, then dip them in the liquid, pulling them out so that they're now red.\nThe mantis will now become quite erratic with its movements, flipping all around the stomach. Immobilize will help out with this, but so will the Plantain Fan, which will push the Mantis back to a part of the stomach and pin it there for you to attack. It will also stop it from being able to fly too much in the air.\nAlong with these attacks, the mantis will sometimes fly up and start to slash its blades, but send out projectiles instead. Its combos will become more agile, and it will often spin around again and again with its blades creating circles around it.\nTransformations are also useful here, and we found that Red Tides proved handy once again. The mantis is susceptible to burn damage, so it will chip away at its health bar while you follow up with attacks.\nWhen the mantis is dead, you'll receive Dian-Cui Loong-Soaring Bracers. With all the main bosses finished, for now, it's time to follow Zhu Bajie up the mountain. On the way though, there are just two more optional bosses to capture to wrap up this portion of the Chapter.\nEmerald-Armed Mantis\nFrom the Mantis-Catching Swamp, fly up and back toward the area where you fought the Gold Armored Rhino and Cloudtreading Deer. We now want to stop on the left, to get the Son of Stones, which is the boss sitting at the edge of the cliff on the left with the neon blue glow.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Son of Stones\nLand behind the Sone of Stones on the cliff and then attack to start the fight. He won't immediately jump up, so you can get a couple of free hits in.\nWhen he does join in, you'll want to watch out for the standard stone boss attack of swiping at you with one hand. In the Son of Stones's case, he will fall over, but will continue to roll toward you, which will damage you if you're hit by it. At the end of this attack, he has to get himself back up, so quickly Immobilize him when he's down to take advantage of the situation.\nUnlike other stone bosses, the Son of Stones mostly uses an elemental attack. The blue glow coming from him is in fact a charge, and he will throw out projectiles or summon waves of lightning to crash down around him. Have Shock-Quelling Powder equipped to combat any lightning damage he might inflict.\nWhen the lighting attacks begin, get as far away from them as possible. He will start to lift his arms up and the lightning will get more intense, eventually ending in an explosion. As he does this, he will knock himself out and fall to the ground. The recovery from this attack takes a while, so dash at him and attack as much as you can. Here's a good opportunity to use Pluck of Many to maximize the time he's down for.\nWhen he gets back up, use the Plantain Fan to stagger him and remove the lightning attacks and then folow up.\nSon of Stones\nWhen the Sone of Stones is down, there's just one more boss to take care of, which is a secret Yoaguai King. To be able to summon it, you'll need to have collected the Skandhas through the previous Chapters. If you haven't already got your hands on these Skandhas, follow our guide to collecting them all here.\nGo to the clearing behind where you fought the Son of Stones, just off to the left. You'll see some water, a large rock to the left of it, and two golden trees on either side of the rock.\nYou want to go to the right of the water to find the secret area that will take you to the hidden boss.\nYou'll need to ascend quite high up, but where the path reaches a dead end, up above there's an opening in the cliff that you can pass through. Follow this until you enter an area that's slightly covered and pass through this tunnel.\nAs you emerge in the wide open space, a Giant Shigandang will appear.\n### Yaoguai King - Giant Shigandang\nUnfortunately, despite its size, you will need to be on foot during the fight. The key to defeating this enormous rocky monster is to head for its fits and attack the blue crystals you can on them.\nIts main attack is to punch down with its giant fists, which unsurprisingly, will one-shot you if you're hit by them. The easiest way to avoid them is to just back up as far away from them as possible. Then, once the Giant Shigandang pauses punching, run up to the fists and keep hitting the blue crystals.\nThe other attack that the Shigandang does is to punch both fists down and send out ripples. Again, you want to hang back as much as you can. The rings will come toward you, and you can jump over them to avoid them. There are times when he'll raise both hands in the air, and seem like he's about to perform this attack, but instead, he's actually going to slam his fists down and just lay there for a bit. This is the perfect time to get in close and attack him.\nAfter defeating the boss, climb the arm that touches the ground and you'll meet the monkey again. Let the cutscene  and you'll get the Skandha of Consciousness.\nGiant Shigandang",
