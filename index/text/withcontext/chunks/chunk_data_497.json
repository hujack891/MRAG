Below you'll find a guide for the Pagoda Realm Region, including how to escape the jail, unlock the purple seals, and defeat the Captains.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Lower Pagoda (Level 1)**\n* **Lower Pagoda (Level 2)**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Captain Lotus-Vision\n* **Upper Pagoda (Level 3)**\n* **Upper Pagoda (Level 4**\n* **Mani Wheel**\n* Yaoguai King - Captain Wise-Voice\n* **Outside the Wheel**\n* **Snow-Veiled Trail**\n* **Warding Temple**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\nAfter winning the battle against Kang-Jin Loong, you'll be swept up and thrown into a jail of sorts, in a new region known as The Pagoda Realm. Thankfully you'll be able to open your cell door without much trouble, but it will be long climb to get out of here.\nStepping out into this eerie dungeon, you'll find that this part of the Pagoda Realm is a prison made up of several circular tiers that comprise both an inner walkway ring, and an outer ring for cells, hallways, and stairs -- all circling a large pagoda (and that's not even the titular one) made to look like a mani wheel (or prayer wheel), as its slowly revolving and featuring large statues on every side.\nAs you begin to step out onto the inner walkway, a voice will call out from the next cell, which has a mysterious purple seal you can't break. You can still speak to the person inside, sitting against a wall next to a dead Rat Captain.\nThey'll warn you against trying to make your own way, but you can't exactly do nothing. Still, it pays to heed their warning -- this place is not going to be easy to traverse, especially with minds \"ebbing away with the tides of chants\".\nBe extra wary when exploring this area, as there are many Cyan Bats hiding up on ceilings. They'll divebomb you with little warning, and explode with ice to harass you as you deal with other threats.\nPast the first Cyan Bat, be sure to check the first open cell on the left to find a Wisp to absorb, and a Snake-Head Mushroom to harvest.\n# The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm\nIt's around this point that you'll likely get your first taste of the \"beguiling chants\" the prisoner mentioned, and there's a lot going on you'll have to make sense of. A large terrifying sound will echo throughout the realm, the pagoda itself will spin even faster, everyone will start glowing, strange new creatures will appear -- and your health will start lowering!\nLet's break it down: The Pagoda Realm's chanting curse is on a global timer, meaning even if you die or go to different Shines in the realm, or even sit around resting at a shrine, the curse can still trigger and persist. **Every three minutes, the chanting will begin, and last for exactly one minute and thirty seconds before resetting.**\nDuring this time, your maximum health will be halved! However, there is a silver lining: The curse will actually slowly refill your entire health bar before starting to lower your maximum health bar (but will still account for damage you've taken if you're currently in a fight and not regenerate past that point). As an added caveat, both the Destined One and all other enemies in the Pagoda Realm will start to glow red. This not only makes enemies easier to spot, but also grants everyone a considerable damage boost -- which can be blessing or a curse depending on who you are facing.\nFinally, during this period, strange new enemies will appear along several of the inner ring walkways. These sentries have tall lantern-shaped heads, and will try to grab you and throw you into the pit if they spot you, which is an instant death!The only way to stop this beguiling chant from continuing to manifest is to defeat the boss at the top of the Pagoda, and it will take some work to get there!\nBe wary of Frozen Corpses along this walkway that can come to life and jump at you with their sword, but also of the Lantern Wardens that appear when the beguiling chant's curse begins. There are two in this area, and will slowly patrol back forth while swiveling their heads around casting spotlights on the ground. Should you step in one, you'll be stunned for a moment as they approach to attack. Dodge before they perform their sweeping head attack or you'll be knocked into the realm's pit.\nInstead, use your Immobilize spell to lock them down and try attacking from behind, and watch out for their head slamming attacks.\nIf you see them perform a hand gesture, expect them to disappear, only to reappear from a different angle to try and kick you without warning.",
    "h2_content": "The next area is a bit deceptive in its multiple paths when in reality the rest of the Pagoda Realm is fairly linear (and even quick) should you be interested in progressing as soon as possible.\nThe main path leads up a slope to the left of the Shrine, and then to a large rock-filled forested area further left that you can ignore if you keep on the main path up to the Warding Temple where the last boss of this area is.\nHowever, you can first explore a second short area off to the right from the Shrine leading downhill.\nCrossing a short rope bridge high above the gorge you came in through, you'll reach a large rocky snowfield with low visibility due to snowy winds. Many Frozen Corpses are scattered around this area can be tough to pick out as you advance, so move cautiously.\nBe sure to check the right corner first to find Tree Pearls to harvest, and a floating green Wisp in the left corner to absorb.\nMaking your way up the snowfield, the winds will die down as the giant titular pagoda of this realm appears to loom up in front of you. This may seem like the main path to advance, but in reality it's more of a teaser.\nYou'll find a large empty field up the slope, leading to a shrouded gate of fog that lets you enter The Great Pagoda. Inside, you can activate a Shrine, but you'll find there's no one in this grand room.\nWhat you will find are two large murals on the first two walls on the left, and looking closely you should be able to recognize them -- they are the scenes depicted to you after completing the previous chapters! With that in mind, you'll want to come back here after getting close to completing the game, once all the scenes have been unlocked in this room, but for now, head back to the Snow-Veiled Trail Shrine.\nHead up the slope full of Frozen Corpses to the large forested area full of rocks. A golden trail will soon appear leading straight ahead and up a broken stairway to the Warding Temple on the hill, but there's an optional area to consider first off to the left.\nExploring this large rock-filled forest, you'll find a lot of Frozen Corpses that will come to lift, and more than a few plants to harvest as well.\nThe further back you get, the more enemies you'll encounter, including a strange new aggressive plant that can spin in place or shoot poison projectiles at you. Defeat this Golden Lotus Guai for a good chance to earn a Golden Lotus. You can also encounter a lone Yaksha Patroller in the middle of the field.\nAs you head up the right side of this field just past where the Yaksha Patroller was, be ready for another Falcon enemy to swoop down between two small gnarled trees. Like the one at the top of the Mani Wheel, he'll attack at range with projectile slices, divebomb you with forward spins, or create tornado gusts to keep you at bay.\nAnother Falcon Guai will appear not far up on the left side between two much larger trees, but apart from these enemies the rest of this sloping forest is largely devoid of enemies. Be sure to check behind the trees where he appeared to absorb another green Wisp.\nYou can find a path continuing at the top of the slope off to the right, past another Golden Lotus Guai.\nWhen the path turns into a large valley, another Falcon Guai will appear, only this one is empowered by the Spirit within. You'll need to attack cautiously against this stronger foe, using Spirit attacks to stagger him, and Cloud Step to sidestep his gusts to flank him from the sides. Defeat him, and you'll gain the Falcon Hermit Spirit.\nHead through the rest of the valley and deal with a Yaksha Patroller, which will lead to another rope bridge leading to a higher ledge.\nUp ahead, you'll find a large stone obelisk with a **Treasure Chest** at its base, which is unfortunately guarded by another strong Abomination with its twin tentacle appendages. Time your attack carefully to avoid its high damage strikes, and then loot the chest to gain some valuable items, which should include a Knot of Voidness and Blood of the Iron Bull.\nThe rest of the path leads right back along a ridge that overlooks the forest you ventured through earlier (as well as some Celestial Pears you can harvest), and eventually over to the side of the Warding Temple that you can drop down to reach the Shrine.\nBefore you head in, be sure to explore the bottom of the stairway for a small narrow path beyond. Check to the left of a small tunnel to find another Abomination guarding a **Treasure Chest** with materials, then head through (watching out for a Cyan Bat lurking above) to reach a dead end cliff overlooking the Grand Pagoda in the distance, and check the left side of the cliff to grab a green Wisp guarded by a Frozen Corpse.",
