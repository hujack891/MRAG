    "h2_content": "The Duskveil is a disfigured and undead creature that -- despite its strange appearance -- behaves like an overgrown rooster, using a variety of stomping or charge attacks, in addition to being able to fly up and out of reach. Though the boss has two phases, you may not have as much trouble as you did with The Scorpionlord, since you won't have to deal with poison, and their attacks are a bit easier to read and counter. Strangely enough, it also starts the fight at around 75% of its health, but it does have a second health bar waiting, so pacing yourself can be the key to this fight.\nSome of The Duskveils attacks can seem unconventional, but once you understand their moves, avoiding them will get easier. At range, they can leap into the air and unsuccessfully flap their wings as they kick out their legs, only to slam down on the ground, and then roll wildly. This means you'll need to either dodge immediately if they are in range, or wait to dodge when they roll.\nThey can also extend white protrusions from their wings at range, and send a row of projectiles toward you. Luckily, these are easy to both dodge through or simply deflect with a quick staff spin, and since the boss performs it at range, you don't need to be wary of quick follow-up attack.\nWhen you close the distance, The Duskveil has a few different stomps and arm sweeps it can perform, but the variations aren't too much to worry about:\nIf it raises its right hoof, be prepared for a quick slam, after which it can either flap away quickly to retreat from any counters you might have in mind, or it will rear back its head and -- after a short delay -- slam it into the ground. The latter will give you more time to retaliate, and both of these moves can be deflected.\nThe Duskveil can also raise its hoof up while pivoting slightly, in which case it will perform a swift kick instead that drags along the ground. It will follow with two slow sweeps of its arms in both directions that need only be dodged once each, or you can use Rock Solid to knock it back.\nOne quick nasty attack to watch out for is if you spot The Duskveil pivot to hide its left arm behind its body, it will launch a very quick jab with that arm, but the good news is that it won't follow up this attack with any others.\nIn addition to its various sweeping arm attacks, it can also take to the air for a different kind of attack, twisting its body into a spinning strike that hits multiple times (but only needs to be dodged once). It will stay in the air and flap up, holding its position for a long moment before slamming down with a single hoof for one final strike. The timing can take some getting used to, but with practice you can avoid it regularly and then retaliate as it pauses for a moment.\nFinally, the Duskveil can also performing a dashing charge attack, running past you back and forth like a bull up to four times.\nThese charges can be deflected or dodged, and after the fourth charge he'll stumble to the ground where you'll have a big chance to unleash some damage.\nWhen you deplete its health bar, a new phase will begin as a Blood Moon pierces the sky, making things look especially eerie. In reality, not too much will change for this second phase, except some bold new moves where The Duskveil pulls out a skeletal sword from its own mouth!\nThere are quite a few ways The Duskveil can utilize his sword, and it's important to note that after each of these combo attacks, the sword will disappear, meaning he has to pull it out each time he starts an attack with it, which has a very visible animation (though there are a few times when its much harder to see coming).\nWhen he pulls his sword out of his mouth at range, he'll quickly launch into one of two attacks:\nOne will be a series of projectiles slashes as he spins about, sending one horizontal projectiles followed by a cross slash projectile. He'll then take to the air and slam down with his sword for a third and final strike.\nIf he's at a middle distance, he's much more likely to perform the same spin attack, only extending his blade instead to slash at you physically with two quick spinning slashes, and then taking to the air.\nUnlike the other attack, he'll throw down his sword at you, embedding it into the ground before he lands on top of it. After a brief pause, he'll raise one hoof up, and slam down on the sword, creating a massive tremor all around.\nLuckily, the moment he lands you can swap into a pillar stance and charge up to avoid the attack and retaliate with a strong charged hit.\nThe Duskveil has a few more ways of forming his sword, and are much harder to see coming. These often happen when he sprays a damaging blood mist in front of him, obscuring him from view -- which means retreating backward can be a wise decision if you want to  it safe.\nFrom the mist, he can either launch into his quick single arm jab, or his new attack where he coughs out his sword from his mouth to stab through the mist and into the ground in front of him.\nAfter grabbing the sword, he'll jump back, and launch a series of projectiles slashes you'll need to dodge one at a time. Luckily, they are evenly spaced, and the timing isn't hard to get down.\nYou'll also find that more than a few of his regular combos from the first phase have been amplified and require further defensive actions. His arm sweeps for example can now extend into The Duskveil quickly pulling out his sword into two sweeping spin attacks, and blend into the other combo where he throws his sword into the ground.\nHis fluttering jump slam can now be extended as he flies back up to slam down a second time, then takes to the air again to pull his sword out to dive at you with a sweeping slice, and then a final aerial attack to stab his sword into the ground.\nWhile his projectile bones unleashed from his arm now come in two waves instead of one, he has a much more dangerous projectile attack that happens when he makes a very loud crowing noise.\nHe'll leap backward after this, sprouting a lot more bony projectiles to throw at you in a concentrated burst. Like before, they can be dodged or even deflected with your staff spin (but they will eat up a lot of stamina).\nHe will immediately follow this by taking to the air, and launching a string of projectiles that arc across the air to hit you in salvos. If you're already low on stamina from deflecting the first attack, you're better off running to the side to avoid them.\nThe good news is that his loud crow leaves enough time for you to interrupt the attack entirely by hitting him with a charged attack or Spirit Attack, cancelling the move entirely.\nOnce you know where and when his sword will appear, the rest of the fight will come down to waiting for openings after his big attack to hit him hard, using your Spirit Attacks and Transformation Spells in this phase to speed things up. With all of his attacks being fairly visible to spot coming, it shouldn't take too long to get the hang of and send this demon rooster to the abyss.\nThe Duskveil\nAfter the Yaoguai King falls, Hong Yi the snake woman will appear to thank you for your part in putting The Duskveil to rest. The broken needle you pull out of Zhu Bajie will appear -- much to the surprise of Hong Yi -- who will offer to repair it, and grant you the **Weaver's Needle Vessel**.\nThis new Vessel can aid you greatly in defeating the final boss of Chapter 4's Temple of Yellow Flowers. You'll also gain a **Double-Combed Rooster Blood Soak** for your Gourd, and both Kun Steel and The Duskveil's Horn, which will finally allow you to complete both the Iron-Tough Armor Set, and craft the Golden Loong Staff!\nPurple Cloud Mountain Complete",
