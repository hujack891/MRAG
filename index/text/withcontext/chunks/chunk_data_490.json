Below you'll find a guide for the Pagoda Realm Region, including how to escape the jail, unlock the purple seals, and defeat the Captains.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Lower Pagoda (Level 1)**\n* **Lower Pagoda (Level 2)**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Captain Lotus-Vision\n* **Upper Pagoda (Level 3)**\n* **Upper Pagoda (Level 4**\n* **Mani Wheel**\n* Yaoguai King - Captain Wise-Voice\n* **Outside the Wheel**\n* **Snow-Veiled Trail**\n* **Warding Temple**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\nAfter winning the battle against Kang-Jin Loong, you'll be swept up and thrown into a jail of sorts, in a new region known as The Pagoda Realm. Thankfully you'll be able to open your cell door without much trouble, but it will be long climb to get out of here.\nStepping out into this eerie dungeon, you'll find that this part of the Pagoda Realm is a prison made up of several circular tiers that comprise both an inner walkway ring, and an outer ring for cells, hallways, and stairs -- all circling a large pagoda (and that's not even the titular one) made to look like a mani wheel (or prayer wheel), as its slowly revolving and featuring large statues on every side.\nAs you begin to step out onto the inner walkway, a voice will call out from the next cell, which has a mysterious purple seal you can't break. You can still speak to the person inside, sitting against a wall next to a dead Rat Captain.\nThey'll warn you against trying to make your own way, but you can't exactly do nothing. Still, it pays to heed their warning -- this place is not going to be easy to traverse, especially with minds \"ebbing away with the tides of chants\".\nBe extra wary when exploring this area, as there are many Cyan Bats hiding up on ceilings. They'll divebomb you with little warning, and explode with ice to harass you as you deal with other threats.\nPast the first Cyan Bat, be sure to check the first open cell on the left to find a Wisp to absorb, and a Snake-Head Mushroom to harvest.\n# The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm\nIt's around this point that you'll likely get your first taste of the \"beguiling chants\" the prisoner mentioned, and there's a lot going on you'll have to make sense of. A large terrifying sound will echo throughout the realm, the pagoda itself will spin even faster, everyone will start glowing, strange new creatures will appear -- and your health will start lowering!\nLet's break it down: The Pagoda Realm's chanting curse is on a global timer, meaning even if you die or go to different Shines in the realm, or even sit around resting at a shrine, the curse can still trigger and persist. **Every three minutes, the chanting will begin, and last for exactly one minute and thirty seconds before resetting.**\nDuring this time, your maximum health will be halved! However, there is a silver lining: The curse will actually slowly refill your entire health bar before starting to lower your maximum health bar (but will still account for damage you've taken if you're currently in a fight and not regenerate past that point). As an added caveat, both the Destined One and all other enemies in the Pagoda Realm will start to glow red. This not only makes enemies easier to spot, but also grants everyone a considerable damage boost -- which can be blessing or a curse depending on who you are facing.\nFinally, during this period, strange new enemies will appear along several of the inner ring walkways. These sentries have tall lantern-shaped heads, and will try to grab you and throw you into the pit if they spot you, which is an instant death!The only way to stop this beguiling chant from continuing to manifest is to defeat the boss at the top of the Pagoda, and it will take some work to get there!\nBe wary of Frozen Corpses along this walkway that can come to life and jump at you with their sword, but also of the Lantern Wardens that appear when the beguiling chant's curse begins. There are two in this area, and will slowly patrol back forth while swiveling their heads around casting spotlights on the ground. Should you step in one, you'll be stunned for a moment as they approach to attack. Dodge before they perform their sweeping head attack or you'll be knocked into the realm's pit.\nInstead, use your Immobilize spell to lock them down and try attacking from behind, and watch out for their head slamming attacks.\nIf you see them perform a hand gesture, expect them to disappear, only to reappear from a different angle to try and kick you without warning.",
    "h2_content": "Past another sealed cell, you can finally find the Lower Pagoda Shrine to rest at, but remember that resting at it will not affect the timer of this area's curse. It's not a bad idea to rest at it after the beguiling chant ends and your maximum health returns to normal, but resting during the curse won't reset your health.\nPast the Shrine, the path will lead into the cells, and a long tunnel through the dark. Up ahead, be wary of a Yaksha Archer who will try and bait you into charging him, only for a Cyan Bat above him to divebomb you from behind with its ice attack.\nJust past the duo, you'll find an open gate leading back to the outer ring, while the interior passageway also continues. If you dip out for a moment, you can look right back the way you came to find two enemies guarding a green Wisp by a pile of rubble with another Yaksha Archer at the top.\nEvade the fighters below and hop up the rubble, and use a jumping heavy attack to boost up to the platform and kill the archer first. The giant sword-wielding enemy below is a Blade Monk, who can unleash powerful but slow blade swings and even send out waves of force with their swing, so engage carefully -- especially if you're health is halved!\nThe interior tunnel will end with a sealed cell gate, as well as a Starved Abomination that will try to ambush you from a corner. Let the creature tire itself out swinging wildly with its sickle before taking it down with just a few hits.\nIf you head along the outside path, you'll find another open jail cell bars to re-enter the interior hall and reach another green Wisp, but be ready to deal with the ambushing Cyan Bat above and Abomination below.\nYou'll have to take the outside path to proceed further, but be ready for the beguiling chant to reveal two more Lantern Sentries that patrol this section, and take them out carefully when their backs are turned.\nWhen you reach an open cell gate ahead with a small lantern posted above it, that's an indication that you've reached a stairway in the interior section that leads to the next level up.\nBefore you head up, keep progressing forward to find another Blade Monk by the ledge. Since he's facing away, you can actually hit him from behind with a charged thrust attack to send him into the pit!\nBehind where the Blade Monk is, you can find a statue with an altar and a tiny chest that holds a **Fine China Tea Bowl Curio**.\nNext, head past the stairs to continue along the cell tunnel to find a dead end with one more Blade Monk guarding a **Treasure Chest** with assorted materials inside.",
