One side has a sealed door with a lone Thunder Rhino Master and a small pot with a green Wisp in it just to the side\nThe opposite side of the Courtyard has an open door leading to the last of Yellowbrow's disciples.\n### Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-Pure\nNon-Pure is a very aggressive fighter, similar to Non-Able, but instead uses a large sweeping monk spade to attack in long combo swings that can be difficult to escape from. Finding opportunities to get your own attacks in can be difficult, but you'll need to resist the urge to jump in too early or you'll be hit and staggered multiple times.\nGiven his long sweeping swings, having backup from A Pluck of Many or Spirits that summon other allies won't work as well as they'll tend to get hit even if he's focusing all his attention on you.\nTo make matters worse, Non-Pure also has a large gauntlet that he can periodically imbue with deflecting power, making him even harder to damage when he's not unleashing combos. Look for the glow in his glove (and especially his arm tattoo glowing bright as he's likely to hide his glove behind his back) to know when he's most likely to knock your attacks aside, and resist the urge to expend your focus points.\nIf you try attacking him when his glove is powered up two many times, he'll eventually retaliate with a counterattack, stunning you for a moment and then unleashing a spin attack that you may not be able to evade in time.\nOne of Non-Pure's most common attacks will be jogging up to you before thrusting his spade forward. A moment later, he'll perform a flourish as he twirls his body so that the weapon's shaft rests on his shoulder, and then spin his body quickly to perform a follow-up horizontal slice.\nAnother quick two-hit combo he can employ is a quick side slice followed by an overhead slam. Since many of his combo attacks cover both vertical and horizontal hits, you can't just backpedal in one direction to evade them.\nWhen he decides to get nasty with his combos, you'll either want to learn the moves and deflect one to knock him off balance, or Immobilize to shut him down. One of his most lengthy combos will come when he sweeps his weapon upward and then back down for two rotations, and then quickly swings it back and forth three more times, before leaping up to perform one last spin attack as he lands. Without a lot of stamina in reserve, it will be tough one to evade completely.\nThis isn't all he's capable of, either. He can also run at you an let out a war cry as he swings his blade in a circle, and then chain it into a tornado of five spins, ending with a jumping slash attack that again is very hard to stay away from unless you can interrupt his attack with spells. Luckily, he'll end the attack with a long flourish, giving you time to get back at him.\nEven his single attack can deal big damage if you aren't ready for their relatively fast speed. He may feint his blade in an upward swing, before launching himself high into the air and crash down with an overhand swing.\nWatch his movements carefully to see if he goes back to his default positioning. If he comes out of the jump attack by pulling his blade around with him, he'll follow up with two spinning slashes that need to be avoided to deflected to stop him in his tracks.\nThe one thing his powered up gauntlet isn't great at deflecting is Transformation attacks -- both from Spirits and Spells. The Ashen Slumber in particular is a good bet, as the Rat Captain has a very long evasive dash, and you can breath fire on him that can't be blocked, nor can your Fiery Burst detonation.\nTime your attacks well to find the gaps in his defenses, and remember to cultivate your Spirits and upgrade your Transformation Spell abilities as needed. When Non-Pure is finally defeated, you'll be able to absorb the last disciples spirit, the Non-Pure Spirit.\nNon-Pure\nBefore leaving his boss room, be sure to look where he was initially standing to find the last **Meditation Point** in Chapter 3, and gain your free Skill Point.\nThe Hall, New Thunderclap Temple Meditation Spot",
