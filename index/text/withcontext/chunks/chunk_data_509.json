Equip Antimiasma Powder so you can quickly use it if you get caught in one too many attacks.\nJust like stone bosses and the flint bosses from Chapter 5, most of the attacks from the Poison Chief will be charges and slams. It will try to use the weight of its body to attack while delivering smatterings of poison around the area.\nIts charges can be avoided, by dashing out of the way just before it reaches you. A similar approach can be applied to dealing with its lunges and punches.\nThe biggest issue is the poison attacks, and it's essential to interrupt them as often as you can. The Plantain Fan can prove invaluable here once again, especially if you deploy it just before a poison attack. It will push the Poison Chief back and allow you to follow up with attacks.
