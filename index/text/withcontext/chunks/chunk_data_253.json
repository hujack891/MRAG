    "h2_content": "As you enter the Cooling Slope for the first time, there are two points of interest to take note of. Up ahead, there's a smattering of rocks. And to the left, there's a Luoija Fragrant Vine.\nIf you hug the rocks to the left, you can collect the Luoija Fragrant Vine safely, but be careful as a Searing-Fire will leap out at you as you get close to it.\nFallen Furnace Crater Luojia Fragrant Vine\nThen, you'll want to go over to that collection of rocks. When you approach, it will transform into your first miniboss of the region, which is the Flint Vanguard.\n### Don't Miss This Spirit!\nOnce the golden spiked ball has flown off the edge of the Ashen Pass, return to The Emerald Hall. Go past the altar and up the path toward the Ashen Pass. Once you've climbed the first set of stairs, you'll see the golden ball wedged into a rock next to the Flame Rhino Master.  Go all the way up to it and you'll be able to take the Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top Spirit from inside.\nTop Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top Spirit\n### Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\nThe fight with the Flint Vanguard is sadly not a one-on-one as Searing and Scorching-Fire enemies will accompany it. These will emerge as soon as you approach, and it's worth clearing them out first so you don't have to think about them while attacking the Flint Vanguard. To do this, run around the outskirts of the Flint Vanguard and bait the creatures into attacking you, then run into the middle of the rock circle to bring out the miniboss.\nWhen it comes to the Flint Vanguard, the main thing to watch out for is its thick rocky arms. It will punch down using these, creating pools of lava where they land. To counter these attacks, use Body-Cooling Powder and your Fireproof Mantle.\nWhenever you're close to the Flint Vanguard, it will go into combo punches. These are typical punches to the ground, and occasionally it will slam both arms down together. These can be dodged, and you'll be able to keep close to the Vanguard temporarily until pools of lava appear -- that's when you want to dash away.\nIt shifts to ranged attacks when you try to create distance, in the form of fireballs. This will just be a single shot each time, so it's easiest to dodge. It will also attempt to close the gap by flying over to you and smashing down.\nWhen it starts to get enranged, it will slam its fists down and shake its head, sending out a barrage of fireballs. Run around when this occurs, to avoid as much of the fireballs as possible.\nGenerally, you want to stick close to the Vanguard, dodge the punches, and build up focus to perform heavy attacks. You can knock it over like this, where it will be on all fours, so you can target it while it's vulnerable.\nWhen the Flint Vanguard is down, be sure to collect the Flint Vanguard Spirit it drops. There's also a green Wisp you can pick up, that's just to the left of the clearing.\nFlint Vanguard\nAfter the fight, take the path that slopes down behind the area where you fought the Flint Vanguard. You'll encounter some more of the Searing and Scorching-Flame enemies, as well as a little green Wisp to the right, by the lava lake.\nAs you head into the next barren section, you may notice the glow of a treasure chest up ahead. Be warned that there are also little glowing patches leading up to, and inside the next clearing, and these are all Flamlings. Clear them out before you go over to the chest, where you can collect Refined Iron Sand from it.\nWhen you've looted the chest, go around to the other side of the rock. There will be an open clearing here, that looks like it's empty. Again, remove any Flamlings from the area, then go to the center of the clearing. Here you'll find a larger glowing patch.\nThis is actually where you can summon a miniboss called the Mother of Flamlings, and to do so, all you need to give over is 4x Flame Ores. Thankfully, Flame Ores are dropped by Flamlings, so you'll hopefully have enough by this point to summon her immediately. Approach the glowing patch and deliver the Flame Ores.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\nThe ground will rumble as the Mother of Flamlings appears, and fireballs will be thrown out as soon as she bursts through the ground. Stand back after delivering the Flame Ores to avoid this attack.\nThese will land on the ground and turn into glowing patches. Unfortunately, these will become Flamlings, so be mindful of these as you run around the arena.\nThe Mother of Flamlings, thankfully, won't move. She'll stay where she is and use ranged fireball attacks, very similar to the Flamlings. To combat this, get as close to her as possible and try to land a few attacks. The downside of this, however, is that she will try to whip you with her body. If you can dodge these, she'll smack herself into the ground and be temporarily stunned.\nAfter hitting her a few times, she'll be frustrated and scream. This is when the Flamlings will emerge and begin to shoot fireballs immediately. You'll want to clear these out as fast as you can and use your Fireproof Mantle and Body-Cooling Powder to counter any fire damage you might experience.\nWhen you've cleared out the first round of Flamlings, she'll reappear. This round of attacks will repeat until she's been defeated, except she can reappear when Flamlings are still in the arena after the first round. Still, the priority should be to remove them first before focusing on her.\nMother of Flamlings\nAfter the Mother of Flamlings fight, pick up the Mother of Flamlings Spirit and then continue on the path down the Cooling Slope.\nMother of Flamlings Spirit\nOn the right, you'll find a tree where you can harvest a Fire Date just after a Scorching-Fire enemy. Be careful of the Flamling that will emerge as you go up to it.\nProceed past this, and look to the left to find a Tenner guarding a chest. Take the enemy down, open the chest to collect Fine Gold Thread and a Mind Core, and continue down the slope.\nGo past the lone Searing-Fire rock and you'll reach the Cooling Slope Keeper's Shrine. Keep going forward past the Keeper's Shrine and look to the right. You'll see an icy archway, and a clear just before it. Head over here, past the Scorching-Fire rocks, and you'll come face to face with the final of the Five Element Carts.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\nLet the cutscene  out as you approach and see the Pale-Axe Stalwart from the mouth of the cart, and then be prepared to use everything you've got against the most aggressive coffin cart of the Chapter.\nIt will combine the movesets from the previous three carts you've encountered and add its own to the mix. While some moves will seem familiar, others you'll need to learn to avoid.\nUse Immobilize when you can to stop it from zooming around and follow up with combo attacks quickly. Landing heavy attacks in this manner will knock the cart down, leaving it vulnerable to further follow-up attacks.\nThe way the cart s with fire will also differ. It will spin around while spewing fire from the front to try and get you. When this happens, stick close to it and spin with it. If you get caught with this move, throw on the Fireproof Mantle to negate some of the fire damage. Another variation you'll see is it spitting fireballs. For this move, it will aim the fireballs and spit them out, and you can dash out of the way to miss them entirely.\nLastly is the difference in punches. The cart will lunge and take swipes at you but also punch the ground like the other carts. To make things trickier, it will also try to grab you.\nWhen it does go to take a swipe at you, try to roll toward it. You'll either end up going underneath it or to the side of it and dodging the attack.\nRusty-Gold Cart\nWhen you've beaten the final cart, you'll receive the Flame Orb Curio. Head over to the area on the right before the doorway and speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart one final time.\nAfter the conversation and the cutscene, you can then approach the frozen-over entrance and break through to head inside.\nThis doorway will take you to the chapter's secret area called the Bishui Cave. We'd recommend completing this before you finish up the chapter. But there's one last miniboss to fight before you teleport to the secret area.\nAs you head inside the cave, go down the slope. You'll see a large structure in the center of the room that's being hit by the light. This is what will teleport you to Bishui Cave, but first, you'll want to look to the left. Here you can find the fifth of the frog bosses in the game, called Baw-Lang-Lang.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang\nMuch like other bosses in this Chapter, Baw-Lang-Lang favors fire attacks. And much like the other frog bosses, you'll see the same set of moves from Baw-Lang-Lang that include the tongue whip and leaping.\nWhen Baw-Lang-Lang whips its tongue, it will be coated in fire. The frog will whip it left to right, or shoot it straight out at you. You can jump over its tongue or dodge the attacks.\nYou'll then find it uses a leaping attack, where it swipes at you twice and then leaps up and over to you, to try and catch you. When it lands, a little burst of fire will emerge from underneath it.\nChanges in its attack pattern will begin around the halfway mark, and it will lean up toward the top of the cave and spit fireballs all around it. Hang back as far as you can when this happens to avoid them.\nIt will then start to breathe fire from its mouth as a jet, in which case, you'll want to get behind it and attack. Lastly, you'll see a change in its leap attacks. Wherever it jumps, it will send out small waves of fire in a circle around it. As you see it leaping, dodge and create distance between the two of you to avoid the circle of flames.\nBaw-Lang-Lang\nWhen you've defeated Baw-Lang-Lang, approach the tall structure in the center of the room to be transported to Bishui Cave.\n**See** **Chapter 5 Secret - Bishui Cave Walkthroughfor a detailed breakdown of how to complete the chapter's hidden area.**\nWhen you return from the cave, go back up the Cooling Slope and toward the area where the golden spiked ball flew off the edge of the cliff.\nCollect the green Wisps from the far edge on the left, then follow the path where the fox went toward the Bull King. This will take you down a path that leads up to the Bull King, and where you can find the next Keeper's Shrine called Fallen Furnace Crater.",
