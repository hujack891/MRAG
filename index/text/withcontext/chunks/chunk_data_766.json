It will try to lunge and bite at you if you face it head-on, so this removes some of the problem of dodging those attacks.

Because it's a wood beast, it's easy to set it on fire with Red Tides attacks. It's also useful to be able to use the heavy attack and dash forward to catch up with it. Once you've built enough focus, perform a heavy attack in Red Ties to knock it over and set it on fire.\nYou can then detransform and follow up with your own strong attacks and it will continue to burn for a while until it douses itself off with the water.\nAs its health starts to get low, it will dive into the water and behave similarly to Jiao-Loong of Waves, where it will try to dive up and catch you by surprise. You'll see it emerge and peek up before it disappears again and the ground begins to rumble.
