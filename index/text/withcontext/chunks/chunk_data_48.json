In these skill trees, you’ll be able to awaken abilities that will reduce your stamina consumption, increase your health, and upgrade your standard attacks.\nStaff Stances comprise Smash Stance, Pillar Stance, and Thrust Stance, **though the latter can’t be unlocked until you reach level 20**. Smash Stance is your starting stance, and Pillar Stance can be unlocked by awakening the first node in the corresponding Skill Tree.\nOn the left-hand side of the Staff Stances tab, you’ll also find uncategorized skills. The ones closest to the Smash Stance set will increase your health recovery, the damage you deal, and the stamina you recover.\nMeanwhile, the ones on the far left will **automatically unlock** as you sink more points into Staff Stances. These will give additional Focus Points, to a total of four, and are also required for you to be able to unlock skill points from the skill tree further down.\nFinally, Mysticism is where you can control the first spell you’ll learn - Immobilize. This will improve the duration of the Immobilize effect, and allow you to cause more damage when attacking using this.",
