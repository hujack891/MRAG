You will get a brief moment of reprieve when he lands to cast Immobilize, giving you time to land your own combo before he leaps back into action and you have to get back on the defensive.\nSome bosses in Black Myth: Wukong can be handled with pure aggression, but this is not one of them. Choosing your moments wisely is imperative in this fight, and try not to get greedy. If you've got one hit left in your combo, but the boss is recovering, leave it. Retreat and attack again once the Mad Tiger is done with its next combo.\nStock up on all medicines before heading into the fight to boost your stats, and don't hold back on your spells because the Mad Tiger certainly isn't going to hold back on you!",
