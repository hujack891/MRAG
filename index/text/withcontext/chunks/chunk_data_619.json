Once you find Awaken Wine Worms, return to him and you’ll be able to upgrade the amount healed with each use!\n* **Brew** \\- With your equipped Drink, you can enhance it by adding a Soak to increase additional effects beyond the heal. You can try it out now by adding the **Gall Gem** , which will increase your poison resistance in addition to the heal from your Gourd.\n* Store - If the Gall Gem isn’t all that enticing, be sure to check his shop, as the Shen Monkey also sells items.
