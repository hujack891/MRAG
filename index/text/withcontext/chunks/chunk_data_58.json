    "h2_content": "Like the other Loongs in The New West, Chen favors using lightning magic, and is a much more caster-oriented opponent compared to the others. You can prepare to mitigate his attacks by making sure you've crafted the Loongscale Armor Set, are stocked up on Shock-Quelling Powder, and apply the Soak to your Gourd that increases shock resistance.\nWhile he's nowhere as strong as the other dragons you've faced, you don't want to get to cocky, or you may find his electric attacks peeling off more of your health than you can restore, even with Zhu Bajie helping out.\nThe old dragon can be pretty agile too, leaping away to float in the air before casting a variety of electric attacks. One of these includes sending out a flurry of small electric orbs at you, though they can be deflected with a quick staff spin.\nHe can also raise his hand up slowly to trigger a row of lightning bolts in the area, which will explode fairly fast.\nSometimes, he'll take to the air instead, and fly at you in a divebomb attack which will require you to dodge both the fly-by, and the resulting row of lightning strikes that follow his attack.\nAnother electric variation will have him performing an underhanded toss of anywhere between one and three small lightning orbs. They'll bounce along the water for a few hops, and then explode in a much wider area to damage you unless you can dodge to the side.\nHe can also shoot lightning directly out of his mouth in a beam of energy. This can happen both when he's on the ground in a quick straight burst right in front of him, or when floating above you in a quick sweep in front of him, and both need quick dodges to stop a quick attack.\nWhile Chen Loong is highly susceptible to being staggered, he has a few tricks to stop you from pressing the attack for too long. His tail can be pretty impressive, and will use it to spin around and attack with it for two rotations, and then leap into the air to perform a delayed third electric slash.\nHe'll often vary this combo up making it hard to read, and either trick you into thinking he's preparing a cast before tail-whipping, or throwing more quick slashes in-between tail attacks -- or even just doing single hits.\nThe dragon won't just stop at wacking you with his tail up close, either. If he proclaims \"To the deepest trench I dive!\" Be ready for him to stick his tail in the ground, only for several giant electrified tails to sprout up in a cluster nearby. You'll need to quickly break off your attack and give them a wide berth, as they'll quickly perform a single huge spin attack all at once!\nOther times, he may only summon one smaller tail, but this one can expel its electrical energy in a projectile blast when the tail swings.\nHis strongest attack by far is when he jumps into the air with his green weapon, charging it with energy before crashing down with it. It will cause a huge electrical explosion when he lands, but then spread outward with several lighting strikes that cover a wide area.\nThe second hit can be extremely tough to dodge, but using the Pillar Stance to get off the ground can soak the blow if you have stamina to spare (though it will probably still stun you).\nRemember that you also have Zhu Bajie as an ally in this fight, and while he won't be able to hold his attention for too long, but he can be useful at giving you some breathing room or interrupting attacks.\nSince Chen Loong doesn't have a whole lot of health or armor, use everything in your arsenal to keep him staggered and unable to hit back whenever possible, and you can rush him down before the fight goes on too long and you start taking double damage too often.\nWhen he's defeated, Chen Loong will throw a bit of a tantrum, and you'll find he's not such a bad guy. He also seems to know Xu Dog, and claims only one of his celestial resurrection pills can ease his pains.\nChen Loong\nBe sure to look on the docks near the small shack by the water to find a **Treasure Chest** for the Blood of the Iron Bull and some materials, and then warp back to the Yellow Wind Ridge to find the Xu Dog back in the cellar below the Crouching Tiger Temple.\nSpeak to him here, and he'll pass along a Special-made Bone-Strengthening Pellet for the poor old Loong. You'll also get the formula to make your own Fortifying Medicament for your trouble!\nReturn to Chen Loong (who now stands outside the shack by the water), and deliver the pellet to him. The old dragon will be overjoyed at your gift, and in return will pass along The Ruyi Scroll to you. He'll proclaim that he now has the strength to unseal the Painted Realm, where he and his fellow deities will now reside -- and you're invited!\n### The Zodiac Village of the Painted Realm\nConsider the Zodiac Village in the Painted Realm your new hub area, a home away from home. Chen Loong has invited his fellow Zodiac Deities to stay here, which include the Xu Dog and Shen Monkey who you've already met. This means you now have a quick hub area to warp to as needed to trade in your Mind Cores, and upgrade your Gourds.\nIn addition to this, Chen Loong himself will accept any seeds you may have randomly looted when harvesting plants, which will create more materials to freely harvest over time.\nFinally, the fourth Zodiac Deity can be found nearby along a path - the Ying Tiger. He's a formidable blacksmith who you can interact with to finally upgrade your armor, allowing you to raise the armor ratings of sets you've found previously but became outdated. He also sells unlimited quantities of lower materials if you need to quickly craft or upgrade older gear.\nYou can even choose to challenge the Yin Tiger to a duel, but be warned, he is incredibly deadly, and likely way beyond your current level. However, if you manage to defeat him, expect to unlock a new Transformation Spell and blueprint for a new armor set!\nFrom the shack where Chen Loong was before entering the Painted Realm, you'll spot a nearby archway and a path leading up through some woods.\nAs you draw near another small building, you can spot a man in trouble, being harassed by three yaoguai. These lesser Apramana Bats can be a pain to deal with, as they'll routinely take to the air to slash at you with waves of force from a distance.\nWait for them to pull their legs up before smashing down to deflect with Rock Solid or dodge and counter with Cloud Step.\nOnce they've been defeated, you can approach the lone man. Zhu Bajie warns you to beware of him, but he seems harmless enough, and tells you he's in search of treasure, and promises to share it when he finds it -- though he'll likely get in trouble again before this is all through.\nHe'll mention part of the treasure's riddle - green without, and red within: a summer treat. Sounds tasty, so be sure to keep an eye out for something matching that description.\nBefore heading back to the North Shore Shrine, be sure to check the large pool of water to the left of the treasure hunter. There's a **Treasure Chest** at the foot of the pool that holds various materials, and at the far end, you can find a small rock with a Gourd Drink placed upon it: **Bluebridge Romance**!\nWhile it can't be upgraded from its base of 36% health restored, it not only increases your movement speed after drinking, but can hold up to three different Soaks, making it an incredibly versatile Gourd Drink to equip for boss fights!\nFrom the North Shore Shrine, keep to the right this time and head along the lakeshore until you round a bend to find what looks to be giant skeletal remains strewn around the beach.\nUp ahead, you'll spot another of the lesser Apramana Bats skulking about a curved skeletal piece, and nestled within is a **Treasure Chest** that holds some materials.\nAnother bat is hiding up ahead on the left in front of a Celestial Pear Tree, but with its back turned you can sneak up and unleash a charged strike first -- so long as you watch out for the Frozen Corpses around it.\nPast a third bat facing a Frozen Corpse censor holder, you'll see the main skeletal remains of the once great Snake General: friend to Turtle General, who was apparently tortured and killed by Yellowbrow.\nAs you head close to inspect the skull of the great snake, a Yaoguai Chief will fly down to intercept you: a much bigger version of the bats you've faced recently!",
