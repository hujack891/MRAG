    "h2_content": "Since the Bullguard is a required miniboss, he can't be missed on your journey through the opening areas of Chapter 1. You'll find him in the Forest of Wolves, not far from the Front Hills Shrine just along the main path across a bridge, keeping to the right. The Bullguard blocks a large gate area leading to the next main region of Black Wind Mountain.\n### Bullguard Miniboss Fight and Guide\nAs your first real boss encounter, you should be prepared for big hits that can take a chunk out of your health, so it’s not a bad idea to make sure you’ve rested up and refilled your healing gourd before taking him on.\nThe Bullguard swings a mean halberd, which he can use to perform devastating overhand slams, and much quicker horizontal slashes that swing twice before a third overhead attack. Luckily, each of these combo hits usually end with him taking a long time to pull his weapon back out of the ground and reset his positioning, which is the perfect time to strike with a light combo or sneak in a heavy attack when he’s recovering.\nHe can also perform multiple overhead swings at once ending with a massive jump attack, so it’s safe to assume that unless he’s charging at you, his swings will almost always come out in multiple hits, and you’ll want to be ready to dodge them all first before you move in and attack.\nOnce you carve out about half of the Bullguard’s health bar, he’ll parry your next strike and move in for the killing blow — until the Keeper intervenes. Using an immobilization spell to lock him in place, the Keeper will pass on the magic spell to the Destined One, giving you your first spell - **Immobilize**!\nImmobilize allows you to bind an enemy in place for a small duration, at which point you’re able to make use of the pause to unload with attacks until the effect breaks. Stronger enemies like this Yaoguai Chief will break out a lot sooner than regular foes, and certain bosses can even resist it entirely, so be wary!\nOnce the Bullguard breaks free and the Keeper vanishes, it will be up to you to finish the fight. Utilize your new Immobilize Spell to bind him when it suits you best — either to ward off an incoming attack, catch your breath so you can heal, or use the moment to hit him from the side, and launch a heavy attack to send him sprawling.\nDon’t get too reckless, as the Immobilize Spell has a moderate cooldown, and uses a bit of your magic meter each time. Unlike your health or stamina, you can’t regenerate magic except by resting at a Shrine.\nWhen the beast finally falls, you’ll likely get a ton of experience, which you can invest in more skill trees that include a new one for your spells like Immobilize. The path forward is now clear to tread, but it’s still a little ways to the next Shrine. If you’re low on health, you can always head back to the Shrine and rest, as enemies like the Bullguard won’t respawn.\nBullguard",
