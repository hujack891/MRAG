    "h2_content": "Look to the right of the Keeper's Shrine to find a green Wisp to absorb. Once you've collected it, continue along the path from the Shrine, toward the open space on the left. When you reach a certain point, the Father of Stones miniboss will jump over the wall near the door on the right.\n### Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones\nJust like fights against other stone bosses, it's best to skip elemental damage and go for pure attack power in this fight. You want your attacks to be heavy and hit hard, and for your defense to be up as much as possible.\nFather of Stones will use a variety of attacks in this fight, however, he's limited by the fact that he's holding a skeleton in one arm. This means he'll only ever try to hit you with one arm, giving you more opportunity to evade attacks or dodge them.\nThe first thing to watch out for is him swinging his arms in a combination move. He will lazily swing an arm at you a few times. But these can be dodged or missed entirely if you step back far enough. Alternatively, he will reach out to try and hit you, and often falls down straight away after performing the attack. As it takes a little while for him to recover, you can get your own combo of attacks in here.\nHe will sometimes leap in the air and try to land on you. Again, these can be dodged and ignored by stepping back. This is actually the case for most of his attacks, so bait him out to hit you and then take advantage of the slow recovery. If you stand behind him too long though, he'll sit down and quickly push himself toward you, rolling over and over to try and catch you.\nThe most dangerous of his attacks are the kicks that spark and send out a line of fire in your direction and when he roars. As soon as he opens his mouth, jump or step back to avoid the immediate area around him, where his roars will hit. Otherwise, this will knock you back and damage you.\nThe way to approach this fight is to build up your combos and then land a finishing blow on him as often as you can. When you attack like this, the heavy blow will knock him over and leave him vulnerable to a beat down.\nWhen you've bested him, collect the Father of Stones Spirit he leaves behind.\nFather of Stones\nFrom here, the path splits in two different directions. There is a door near the wall where the Father of Stones climbed over, but ignore that for now. Instead, go straight up past it.\nYou'll come to a path that slopes down, where you can harvest another **Fire Bellflower** on the left. Once you've collected it, stick to the path that goes up to the right and head for the Turtle Treasure in the distance.\nIt guards a chest, so once you've defeated it, open the chest to collect Knot of Voidness along with various medicines.\nTurn back on yourself, and now take the path down to the right. Clear the area of the Revenant Charbones, and head for the bottom of the stairs.\nOn the left, you'll see a **Purple Lingzhi** and a path to take, but there's also one straight up ahead at the edge of the cliff.\nGo straight first, then look for the archer on the lower level to the right. Once you've eradicated the archer, follow the path all the way to the right to find three Revenant Charbones guarding a **Luoija Fragrant Vine**.\nPick up the Fire Bellflower on the left at the bottom of the wooden path before you head toward the Revenants and the vine.\nHeight of Ember Luojia Fragrant Vine\nTurn back on yourself and go back up the stairs and the path. Turn to the right now and grab the Purple Lingzhi by the tree. This will turn into an enemy, but once you beat it, you'll receive a Purple Lingzhi and Nine-Capped Lingzhi.\nIn the distance, you'll see more Revenants and a Bull Guard by an altar, where there are green Wisps to collect. Clear the area and absorb the Wisps, then go back up to where you fought the Father of Stones.\nYou'll see a door on the left, near hanging yellow fabric. Open this, and head down the stairs toward the statue. The health bar for the Gray-Bronze Cart will appear, but you don't need to worry about fighting it just yet.\nFollow the path to the left and toward the cave at the end of it. Just before you get there, you'll see another green Wisp to be collected to the left. Once you've grabbed it, head inside the cave.\nThe cave is very dark, but you'll be able to see the faint glow of a green Wisp to the left and lava to the right. Head for the lava, to find a Revenant Charbone, but also a pathway that leads outside.\nGo out here and toward the statues to collect the Amber Prayer Beads curio from the box.\nAmber Prayer Beads\nGo back inside the cave and now turn right to collect the green Wisp. Take out the Revenant near it, then go forward.\nThe path splits here, and you'll probably notice the green Wisp on the right first. On the left, you'll be able to see an enemy with a blue Spirit. You'll want to head for the green Wisp first. But before you go collect it, be prepared that there's a lot of the Revenant Charbones in this area and they'll all charge at you.\nCollect the Wisp, then grab the Purple Lingzhi just beyond it that will turn into another enemy. Once you've got the Purple and Nine-Capped Lingzhi, turn right and collect another couple of green Wisps that sit at a dead end.\nTurn around and go straight ahead to where the enemy holds the spirit. Defeat this enemy to get Blood of the Iron Bull and collect the Charface Spirit.\nCharface Spirit\nContinue forward and take down the next revenant, so you're free to collect the green Wisp on the right. Then turn left and make your way outside.\nLook to the right to find a Charface guarding a chest. Defeat the enemy then open the chest to collect Refined Iron Sand. Now face the opposite direction and go straight up the narrow path. At the other end of it, the next element cart blocks your progress.\n### Yoaguai Chief - Gray-Bronze Cart\nHead straight up the narrow path, and when you're close to the cart, look to the left to find an alcove you can dip into to avoid the fire attacks that also has a green Wisp in it.\nYou can expect the same moveset from each of the carts, so again, the Fireproof Mantle Vessel works wonders here. For this one, though, you won't be able to get close to the feet and stay there without being hit with the fire attacks. So, stick close during the fist slam (without the fire) and dodge this. But when it rears up, jump back into the alcove to protect yourself from any fire attacks.\nGray-Bronze Cart\nWhen the next cart has been defeated, progress up the path. As you approached the cart, you will have heard someone shout for help. Who that is, will soon become clear as you climb the stairs and hear the cries for help again.\nEnter a large open area to find the fox guai suspended from a tree, and her two captors on the way. After she explains that she's been captured, two giant heads will descend upon the arena.\n### Yoaguai Chief - Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind\nQuick as Fire, Fast as Wind are a duo of heads that will use two elements to attack, both causing fire damage. As you may have guessed through this Chapter so far, the Fireproof Mantle is one of the best bits of equipment you can bring along with you. Quick as Fire is the head on the ground that will roll toward you, leaving trails of fire in its wake, while Fast as Wind is the floating head with the tusks.\nStart by focusing on Quick as Fire, using your Fireproof Mantle to protect you from the floor covered in fire. He will just roll around the arena, spewing fire all over the place, so the main focus is to dodge this and chase him with attacks.\nWhen you have the Fireproof Mantle equipped, you can stand in the fire and continuously hit him without worrying about your health bar. If you hit him hard enough, he'll go flying and you'll need to catch up to him to continue landing attacks.\nWhile you're doing this, Fast as Wind will follow you blowing gusts of wind down on you. If this hits you, it will also burn you. Avoid this while you focus on putting an end to Quick as Fire.\nWhen Quick as Fire is down, the intensity of Fast as Wind's attacks will increase. He'll now start to charge at you, sweeping down as close as possible to the ground, to hit you with his tusks. The best counter to this is a dodge, which will see him hit the ground and get his tusks stuck for a few seconds.\nBe ready to follow him and hit him as soon as this happens. Even when he pulls his tusks out from the ground, he'll be temporarily stunned, giving you enough time to attack. He will continue to chase you, blowing wind on you, but will also start to spit gusts of wind out. These will turn into small tornados but they're extremely short-lived, so as long as you can dodge the initial gust, you should be able to quickly get out of the way of the tornado.\nQuick as Fire, Fast as Wind",
