    "h2_content": "The Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top fight can be challenging, especially since there are two foes to deal with instead of just one. Thankfully, one usually hangs back, giving you an opportunity to focus on one half of the iron ball at a time rather than having to tackle both for the entirety of the battle.\nThese foes can use both halves of the iron ball to roll around the arena at high speeds, sending you flying if you get hit. Nailing the Perfect Dodge timing is a great help in this fight. The trick is to dodge just before the ball hits you, which oftentimes can be later than you think it will be. Practice makes perfect with Perfect Dodging, though, and the more you try, the better you will get.\nThe foes will also use each half of the iron ball as a shield of sorts. You will not do any damage to them by hitting this shield, so try to get behind them whenever they are shielding themselves. They are both armed with weapons as well as the dangerous ball, so keep an eye out for their swings and watch your back for the other enemy at all times.",
