Underneath the tree sits the Cloudtreading Deer.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Cloudtreading Deer\nThe Cloudtreading Deer will try to put as much distance as possible between you, so you'll want to use spells like Immobilize to keep it in place or Cloudstep to catch up to it. There are two phases to this fight, and aggression is key in the first one, so you can get to the second phase in as little time as possible with spells left over.\nIt will start by attacking with its horns, sweeping at you to try and hit you. It will also rear up, and hold itself for a few seconds, before slamming down and sending out ripples of frost damage. If you get behind it, just like the Rhino, it will buck to kick you with its hind legs.\nIn this first phase, you'll want to have plenty of Body-Warming Powder, as the Cloudtreading Deer uses frost as its elemental attacks. But the most dangerous aspect of this first stage is the fact that the deer sends out lots of little tornadoes. While the small whirlwinds of ice are easy to dodge, these tornadoes are much harder to avoid and also signal when the deer will ramp up its attacks.\nTo make the first part of this fight easier, we'd recommend equipping the Wind Tamer as your vessel. It will wipe these tornadoes out as soon as you use it, and mean there's one less thing to focus on. The deer will still leap in the air and tread the clouds to attack you, but you won't need to worry about being hit by the annoying tornadoes. While this is useful once, you'll obviously need to wait for it to become available again, and in the meantime, the deer will continue to use this attack.\nIf you're taking it on without the vessel, the best thing you can do is get as far away from the tornadoes as possible and let the deer come to you. You'll be able to get a better look at it like this, while it jumps around in the air and prepares to slam into the ground. When it lands, dodge or jump to avoid the shockwave of frost, and then go all in on attacking the deer.\nWhen it seems like the fight is over, it's just getting started and entering its second phase. Blood will spill from the deer and pool all around it. The blood will poison you, so you'll want Antimiasma Powder to help you deal with any damage that comes from it.\nIn this phase, you'll need to avoid the pools of blood. There are also some projectiles, where little orbs of blood will float up in the air and then hone in on you. Thankfully, you'll have a little bit of help with this one, as Zhu Bajie will appear in the second phase to give you a hand.\nThis part of the fight is more about managing how long you can stand in the blood for, and jumping back out when you're about to be completely poisoned. Try to bait the deer to run out of the patches of blood, and into the ice where you can attack it freely. You can also use the Wind Vessel in this phase to down the deer temporarily.\nCloudtreading Deer\nOnce the Cloudtreading Deer is down, you'll receive the Lotus Silk Cloudtreaders, and it's time to continue the sweep of the mountain.\nHead back to the Keeper's Shrine once you've defeated the deer. Fly up high again, and look straight ahead for another rocky part of the cliff. It'll be hard to see from here, but fly straight forward and you should see a distinctive tall white tree. Next to it is a clearing, where you can find the final Poison Chief.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 4\nYou know the drill with the Poison Chiefs at this stage, where heavy attacks, Immobilize, and the Plantain Fan can all help to make short work of it. Once you're done with the final one, hop back onto the Somersault Cloud.\nPoison Chief 4\nFly up and face toward the water. You'll be heading right along the river, to reach the next main boss. But before you go there, there's another optional boss to take care of.\nYou can actually find multiple of the Water-Wood Beasts along the way, but there's only one where the health bar appears where you fight it, and it's much bigger than the others, which is why we've just included the one here.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Water-Wood Beast\nTo find the Water-Wood Beast, continue along the river, back toward where you first saw the Feng-Tail General. You're going to want to find where the river ends, which is where it widens and becomes a circle. It's to the left of the area where the Feng-Tail General was.\nAs you approach it, you should see a small lot of bubbles coming up from the center of it. When you get closer to it, the Water-Wood Beast will appear.\nIn general, you want to stick behind the beast as much as you can. It will try to lunge and bite at you if you face it head-on, so this removes some of the problem of dodging those attacks. Immobilize will also help you out here, as similar to the rhino, it will move around and you'll want to be able to take advantage of those frozen moments as much as possible. Though you will want to watch out for it bucking and kicking back.\nThis fight is where your transformations can really shine, particularly Red Tides. Because it's a wood beast, it's easy to set it on fire with Red Tides attacks. It's also useful to be able to use the heavy attack and dash forward to catch up with it. Once you've built enough focus, perform a heavy attack in Red Ties to knock it over and set it on fire.\nYou can then detransform and follow up with your own strong attacks and it will continue to burn for a while until it douses itself off with the water.\nAs its health starts to get low, it will dive into the water and behave similarly to Jiao-Loong of Waves, where it will try to dive up and catch you by surprise. You'll see it emerge and peek up before it disappears again and the ground begins to rumble. You'll be able to see ripples in the water, that show you the exact path the beast is taking to reach you.\nWater-Wood Beast\nWhen it's defeated, head back along the river and look for the golden tree.",
