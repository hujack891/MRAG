    "h2_content": "As a required boss fight, you'll encounter the Macaque Chief in multiple points when exploring The New West and progressing to reach the Sage's Will held by Goldenbrow.\nThe first time you'll encounter this enemy is early in the Snowhill Path as you reach a plateau along the Snowclad Path after you spot the monkey awakening the Frozen Corpses.\nOnce defeated, the Macaque Chief will flee, only to appear later on in the Pagoda Realm after you have escaped the prison. You'll find him just inside the Warding Temple, harassing the Wise Master until you intervene.\nAfter a second defeat, you'll face him one last time near the end of the chapter, in-between two bouts that you'll have with the end boss, Yellowbrow.\n* First Encounter\n* Second Encounter\n* Final Encounter\n### Macaque Chief Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\nMany of his attacks inflict Frost, and if your bar fills, you'll have extremely reduced mobility and be unable to dodge many of his attacks. Plan ahead by crafting or buying Body-Warming Pills to offset this.\nThe Macaque Chief is fairly proficient with the giant curved blade he wields, and begins the fight by slamming it down to send a vacuum slice projectile right at you.\nHe can also heave his blade around that will send his body spinning, attacking with two quick spinning slice attacks. Often times he'll end up holding the blade with his foot, and perform a final upward slash as he backflips, sending out another projectile slash.\nHis one major attack will have him jump into the air and slam his blade into the ground, and then perform series of quick claw swipes in front of him with surprising reach, all while keeping close to the blade behind him -- meaning he can't really pivot if you dodge and attack from the sides.\nHe'll step back to grab the sword with his foot and jump onto its hilt, before preforming a quick roll along the ground to drag the sword in a whirlwind slice with a large reach to it, followed by a final downward slam, so don't press your attack too hard during this combo, or Immobilize him before the second part of his combo.\nA longer deadly combo attack he can employ comes with three quick slashes ending in a jumping upward slash. After a brief pause in the air, he'll use his foot to send the blade slamming down vertically, and then yank it back up in an arc for a final two-hand diagonal slice attack. Your Rock Solid won't always stagger him mid-combo, so it's better to wait and parry the final slice so you can retaliate faster.\nIf he begins to hold the blade in both hands, prepare for an extended attack with three alternating slices ending in an upward swing with a long delay. When he finally brings the blade down, he'll do so in a spinning multi-hit slash, followed by a final slam to emit a projectile slash.\nOnce you get him to around half his health, he'll suddenly jump backwards in retreat, and start putting his hands together to signal mercy and defeat.\nDo not be lured in by this gesture, as it's all an act -- as he'll eventually look up and use his tail to bring the blade up in an upward slash with a projectile slice at you!\nFinally, if you spend to much time dishing out damage to his face, he'll eventually counter with an unexpected move: puking on you. This will deal an immense amount of poison buildup, so be ready to Immobilize or dodge around behind him.\nWith his small frame, the Macaque Chief is fairly susceptible to being staggered with charged up heavy strikes. Build up your focus from light attack combos when dodging him, and then knock him down with big hits or after deflecting his moves.\nMacaque Chief (Snowhill Path)\n### Second Encounter - Warding Temple\nWhen you fight him a second time, he'll largely have the same moves, but as an added bonus for this fight, you can actually use the Ancient Master's circle of fire to your own advantage, as the Macaque Chief can't move through it. If you ever see him preparing for a big series of slashes or need to get away and heal simply move to the opposite side of the circle, and his attacks won't reach you.\nMacaque Chief (Warding Temple)\n### Final Encounter - Mahavira Hall\nFor this last bout with the Macaque Chief, your friend Zhu Bajie will be here to help, but will warn you that the sack's magic draws out evil to empower this foe beyond his normal limits.\nEven though you'll have the help of a friend, don't expect this to be an easy fight, as the Macaque Chief hits harder than ever with his evil sword. On the plus side, your health, mana, and gourd will be fully replenished after the Yellowbrow fight, and if you are defeated here, you can re-enter the temple to skip the first fight and pick up where you left off.\nA lot of the Macaque Chief's attacks should look familiar, which is a good thing as you'll be able to accurately react and avoid his most common attacks.\nExpect him to employ his reliable sword stab where the claws out in front of him before grabbing the sword back with his legs to swing at you with, but the range will be greatly increased.\nHe also employs a lot of usual blade swipes, and his multi-hit spinning two-handed swings, which now create large projectiles slashes in front of him.\nLuckily, the Macaque Chief is just as prone to staggering as he was before, even more-so now thanks to the combined efforts of you and your ally, you can repeatedly knock him out of certain moves with well-times heavy hits that sends him toppling to the ground. A single focus point is you need to poke him off his sword when he stands on it!\nUnfortunately, it won't be long before the Macaque Chief makes an effort to rectify this, and takes to the air. He'll then send out two shadow versions of himself to fly down and strike you, but they actually stick around to fight!\nWhile it's tempting to leave the shadows to Zhu Bajie to fight on his own, you're much better off repositioning yourself to take on the clones (and you may even want to summon your own clones if you can find some breathing room.\nThe clones don't have a whole lot of health (but they can replicate most of his moves - including poison spewing!), so go all in and blitz them quickly with a combination of Spirits attacks and Transformation Spells like Ashen Slumber, getting in enough hits to detonate yourself and deal massive damage to everyone if possible.\nThe sooner you remove the clones from the fight, the sooner you'll be able to tag team the Macaque Chief again -- but be prepared for him to pull the similar trick later on if the fight is drawn out long enough.\nInstead of permanent clones, he can also fly up and create kamikaze versions of his shadow clones to fly at you for a single slash, while he prepares a mighty slash of his own as a third and final shadow comes your way.\nEven without clones, he can still fly up to charge his sword, and then charge you with a fast-diving slash attack that you can deflect head on to stop him in his tracks.\nIf you dodge instead, be ready for him to pivot into a jumping slash attack after landing, which will expel a cyclone of blade slashes around him after a short delay.\nAnother new move he can perform when jumping on his blade will be to launch himself into the air instead of slashing with it, which will expel a handful of projectiles feathers from his wings that will fly down at you quickly after hanging in the air for a moment. If you have the time, you can spin your staff, or just simply dodge as they will all reach you at the same moment.\nAfter you've defeated his clones and beaten the Macaque Chief one final time, you'll be able to leave the enchanted seed sack and continue your pursuit of Yellowbrow, but not in the way you might expect.\nMacaque Chief (Mahavira Hall)",
