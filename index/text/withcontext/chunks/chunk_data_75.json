Once all are cleared out, return to the long wooden walkway area.\nIf you look just to the left of this wooden walkway before the ruins, you can spot a small wooden plank leading off to an area where a Wolf Assassin is waiting in the shadows. Unlike the other assassins you fought in the cave, this one is a lot stronger than the rest, and his evasive maneuvers can make him hard to pin down.\nOnce you defeat this stronger Wolf Assassin, you’ll find that he will leave behind a Blue Spirit you can absorb for a new Spirit Attack! He also guards a chest you can loot to earn a **Blood of the Iron Bull** material upgrade, and 3 **Stone Spirit**.\nHead back to the rooftop area where a Bullguard like the first mini-boss you fought stands alongside a few more Wolf Archers behind him and on a ledge to the side. Use your Cloud Step to take out the one all the way back, then look for some green slanted rocks to try jump up and then left to reach the ledge with the last archer.\nWith the ranged support out of the way, you can safely engage the Bullguard. Since this one isn’t a mini-boss, he’ll go down a lot faster when you Immobilize and punish him during his lengthy swing attacks.\nHead along the far wooden platforms past where the Bullguard was stationed to find one last Wolf Sentinel and Archer, and Cloud Step past the melee attacker to slam into the archer first before finishing off his friend.\nBefore engaging with more Wolf Guai, pause at a small altar along the cliffs. Here you’ll find one last golden pot to open, containing a **Celestial Nonary Pill** , which will greatly increase your maximum stamina — the third and final pill to find in Chapter 1!\nBlack Wind Mountain Celestial Nonary Pill\nThe rest of the long stairway up is lined with assorted Wolf Guai, but between your new Cloud Step, Spirit Attacks, and other new moves, they won’t stand a chance against you. Be sure to look along the left by some graves to find some Aged Ginseng as you keep heading upward. If you run out of mana for your Cloud Step, just keep enemies or the environment between you and the Wolf Archer’s opening salvo, and then rush them when they start shooting single arrows again.",
