    "h2_content": "There’s one very important thing to get out of the way before discussing the rest of the fight. Despite the name, the Rat King of Flowing Sands is not your true target, and in reality you can complete this battle as soon as you defeat his son, the Second Rat Prince. However, if you choose to engage in regicide yourself, know that the prince will become enraged at the death of his father, and will gain a massive damage increase with empowered moves. But for all this risk, there is a reward — defeating the empowered Rat Prince will allow you to absorb his Spirit to use in attacks, which you **can’t gain otherwise**!\nWhen the battle begins, you’ll notice that the King wisely does not try to fight you up close. He’ll scurry behind his son and out of sight while the Second Rat Prince tries to hold your attention with massive swings from his spiked mace. The King can even burrow underground, creating a trail of flying dirt as he tries to evade you.\nLeft to his own devices, he’ll most often emerge to scurry up one of the five large stone pillars in this boss arena, and begin pelting you with rocks from afar. One or two rocks won’t be lethal, but he can soon start to hurl a ton your way and stagger you when you’re trying to survive against the Prince.\nThat said, if you keep the Prince between you and his dad, there’s a very good chance he’ll lob a rock at his son’s own head — thank goodness for friendly fire!\nThe easiest way to get the King to come down again is to simply lure the Second Prince over to one of the pillars. Let him strike at you wildly, and he’ll destroy the pillar and send the King toppling down to be hit. He doesn’t have much health, and has a hard time getting away, especially if you catch him some distance away from his son who can sometimes take his time closing the distance.\nIf you do want to do defeat the King but are worried about incurring the Prince’s wrath, a good idea is to attack the King whenever he’s exposed, but then focus your attention on taking the Prince’s health down to a manageable level so that when you defeat the King, the Prince can’t last long.\nThe Second Prince himself will use basic attacks like a dashing stab with the point of his spiked mace, or slam the ground in front of him repeatedly.\nThis usually ends with a quick wave of force as he pulls his weapon up that you’ll need to dodge, so don’t get too gutsy trying to retaliate early on this attack.\nIf you hear him start to yell at a distance, be prepared for a charge attack that comes with a three hit smashing sweep attack, and wait until his final attack to retaliate with your own combo attack.\nSometimes, he’ll even rear back for a quick headbutt slam, but the move will usually stagger himself, and a quick dodge will give you a lot of time to lay into him.\nIt’s when you kill the King that you’ll really have to start worrying. He’ll power up with blasts of wind as his mace glows hot, and will now imbue his strikes with fissures that erupt all around the impact site of his weapon!\nHis new charge attack has a jumping slam that will create a ring fissures all around him, which you’ll need to get away from rather than trying to counter.\nHis overhead slam can similarly raise a line of fissures from the strike, making dodging to the side your best bet.\nExpect his swings to hit harder and move faster, often hitting twice in a row in quick succession. If he jumps through the air past you, he’ll often go for a lunging sweeping strike that sends him sliding back past you, but gives you the opportunity to dodge alongside his strike to hit him where he ends up.\nAnother terrifying new move is for him to do a slow spin ending with a weapon toss right at you. He’ll quickly follow up with a leaping dive attack to reach his mace, and then pull it out of the ground and swing it forth, which should quell any thoughts of trying to attack at this point.\nIdeally, the lower you have his health before killing his father, the less time you’ll have to worry about this phase if you can rush him down. If you don’t kill his dad, he’ll scurry off as soon as the Second Prince falls. If not, you’ll be able to help yourself to the Second Prince’s Spirit, as well as a Pungent Flesh Chunk.\nKing of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince",
