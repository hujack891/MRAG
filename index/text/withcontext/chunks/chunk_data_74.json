    "h2_content": "The self-imposed King of the Black Wind Mountain has been waiting for you, and though he’s only facing you now in his human form, he’s got a lot of powerful attacks to watch out for.\nThe Black Wind King will start the fight with a jumping spear thrust, pausing in mid-air briefly before lunging forward, and powering his spear with the Black Wind to throw it into the ground in front of him as he lands.\nHe’ll often follow this jumping attack with two spins of his spear until it lands behind him, and give you a big opportunity to commence an attack of your own as he recovers from the move.\nAny time he empowers his spear with the black wind effect, you can bet he’ll move close to perform up to three big slash attacks in short succession. Always wait until the third attack lands before trying to counter, and use your Spirit Attack when you know you have room to land the hit.\nBe on your guard whenever you try to attack him head on, as his favorite attack at close range is taking a quick swig of his own gourd before breathing flames in front of him. A quick dodge can put you behind him, allowing you to continue your light attack combo as he finishes spraying the area in front of him.\nIf you see him raise one foot up, quickly Immobilize or dash to the side, as he’ll try to stagger you with a quick kick, and then race forward with his spear to keep charging into you for multiple hits that’s nearly impossible to get out of once he starts.\nHis most frustrating attack will come when he transforms into the Black Wind itself, becoming a wisp-like thing that floats around the arena. You’ll need to look carefully for the small “bursts” emanating from the wisp that denote its charge attack straight at you, and can happen in two quick dashes back and forth.\nOnce you see the wisp fly up, retreat away from the center of the arena where the Black Wind King will reappear in a large explosion. Take this time to heal up or use any consumable medicines you think might give you an edge.\nAfter losing about half his health, the Black Wind King will get even more aggressive with his titular wind, and start disappearing entirely in a gust without forming into a wisp. When this happens, retreat and regain your stamina, and be ready for the moment he appears, as he’ll likely do so in mid-combo attack.\nThese can include a length combo that he’ll usually start with a shove before stabbing his spear into the ground in front of him, then grabbing onto it to launch himself off feet first before quickly slicing downward at you, and then slamming his fist down for a massive explosion you’ll want to steer clear of.\nAfter his next Black Wind assault, be ready to transform using the Red Tides Spell, and charge up a dash attack the moment he lands in the center of the arena, and use it and the transformation spell’s pogo attack to perform a massive hit once you catch him after a teleport.\nCounter each of his teleports when his attacks complete, and you’ll soon defeat the Yaoguai King, forcing him to retreat as he yells for you to face his true form at the top of the mountain. However, in his retreat, he’ll leave behind some of his Black Wind, which the Keeper of the Mountain will harness and pass onto you, giving you a brand new spell: **Cloud Step**.\nBlack Wind King\nThis spell will allow you to vanish while dashing forward, creating a copy of yourself that enemies will target. While in this mist-like form, you’ll be invisible for a short duration, and attacking will execute an Unveiling Strike for increased damage while catching foes off guard!\nBe sure to thoroughly explore this cavern temple after the boss retreats, as there’s plenty of loot to find. Start by checking the far corners to the right when looking back at the entrance you came in through. Look for a group of large pots for one with a golden glow, and break it open to find an **Awaken Wine Worm**. These upgrades can be given to the Shen Monkey back at the Marsh of the White Mist to increase the amount of healing each charge of your Medicine Gourd’s drink will recover!\nYou should also look to the right of where the Black Wind King was standing next to the holder for his spear at the start of the battle, where you can find a small wooden table next to two bells with a box. Open it to find an **Agate Jar** — a Curio you can equip.\nCheck the sides of the cave to find some Jade Lotus and Aged Ginseng, then head to the far end to sidle through an exit. This disguised loading screen will turn the day into dusk as you find yourself closer to the top of the mountain.",
