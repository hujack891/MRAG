    "h2_content": "Wandering Wight has a series of extremely hard-hitting attacks, and he's not afraid to use them. Some of these attacks can potentially one-shot you, so learning how to recognize and dodge them will make the fight much easier. Here are the attacks you can expect to see from Wandering Wight:\n* Ground Pound Attack (this attack has a massive aftershock that rips the surrounding ground up)\n* Ground Smash\n* Swipe Attack\n* Stomp Attack\nWandering Wight's swipe and stomp attacks are easy enough to avoid with the right timing. The ground pound moves, however, are the most dangerous tricks he has up his sleeves. The aftershocks that tear up the ground after those attacks can destroy you just as easily as they do the arena. The best way to combat those aftershocks is to run away and get as much distance between you and Wandering Wight as possible before the ground fractures.",
