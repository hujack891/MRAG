The Gall Gem is one of the most basic Soaks, giving you a slight buff, although not quite as drastic of a buff as many of the others you will find later on.\nWhile not quite as potent as Drinks, Soaks are important to your overall build to ensure you have an extra passive buff that benefits your style or game while you heal. Having the Gall Gem equipped to your Gourds will moderately increase Poison Resistance for a short duration after using the Gourd.\nUnlike the Drinks in the game and the Gourd itself, Soaks can't be upgraded at the Shen Monkey Vendor, so you are stuck with this small poison resistance buff throughout the game if you have it equipped. So, be sure to head back to the Shen Monkey Vendor at any point if you do want to change your Soak or how your Gourd behaves.",
    "h2_content": "The Gall Gem Soak in Black Myth: Wukong can be found in Bamboo Grove \\- Marsh of White Mist Shrine in Black Wind Mountain after talking to the Shen Monkey Vendor upon freeing him from the enemy attacking him.\nYou will naturally come across this enemy and the Shen Monkey Vendor as you  through the chapter as it is along the main path.\nWhen on the ramp leading downwards, simply follow the monkey into the cave on the right to get the Soak. This is undoubtedly one of the easiest ones to find in the game.\nThere are tons of Soaks to be found throughout the game, across each chapter. For even more guides on these areas, check out our full Black Myth: Wukong walkthrough. You can also keep track of the Awaken Wine Worm locations and Luoija Fragrant Vine locations, which are key items for upgrading your Gourd.",
