    "h2_content": "Once you've completed the stamina and health test from the Feng-Tail General, drop down from it and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire.\n### Gold Armored Rhino Boss Fight and Guide\nThe key to making this fight as easy as possible is to break the Rhino's horn. You want to do this as quickly as possible, so we'd recommend going in with the Wandering Wight Spirit equipped. Speed is essential here, as you'll need to hit the Rhino head-on to break the horn.\nOnce its horn is broken, it’ll try to get away from you. Use Immobilize if needed to keep the Rhino in place, then quickly use Wandering Wight to smash the horn. Follow this up with Pluck of Many and the Plantain Fan to knock the Rhino over repeatedly and overwhelm it with your duplicates.\nWhen you can't use the Wandering Wight, you need to build focus quickly. Alternatively, just keep holding charge until you’ve built your focus up. If you’re building your focus up naturally, then it’s worth using Immobilize when it's ready again to get the Rhino to stand still so you'll have more chance of hitting your target. You don't want to waste your attacks in this, otherwise, you could be in for a lengthy fit.\nThough you can do damage by hitting the Rhino in other areas, there’s little point in doing so unless you want the fight to last a long time. If you miss hitting the horn, you can still attack it. Avoid hitting its face and instead focus on hitting it from behind. This will annoy it, and it will buck to try and kick you with its back legs.\nBut if you’re holding charge to build it up, wait until the Rhino is coming toward you or pauses for a moment, and then unleash the attack. One of the best times to hit is when it's moving slowly, with sparks appearing around its horn.\nUnfortunately, it won't be very long until lots of lightning starts to appear around the Rhino. When this happens, it will rear up and more lightning will start to strike the ground all around the field. This means that the horn is about to regrow, and you'll need to prepare to break it again.\nBeyond this, expect attacks where it will charge at you. There are rocks you can use in the arena to hide behind for a little while. However, once these are destroyed, you'll need to dodge out of the way. When it's close to you, it will also try to swipe at you by pulling its head back, then swinging it to the side to catch you with its horn. These are great moves to dodge and build up focus if you've unlocked the ability to do so in the skills tab.\nLastly, you can expect a few projectile attacks from the Rhino as well. When it puts its horn down to the ground and drags along it, it will flick rocks up at you. Usually, these are five rocks at a time and you can move out of the way of them easily if you're not too close to the Rhino.\nThe fight is very much a rinse-and-repeat situation, where you'll just want to try and hit the horn as much as you can to try and break it.\nGold Armored Rhino",
