Keep your distance or use Immobilize to score free hits, and then wait until they fall dizzy to hit them with more attacks.\nFor all their extra health, they don't have too many more moves than a regular enemy, so keep on the offensive so they don't have a chance to sprout more spore projectiles, using Immobilize to lock them down and Rock Solid when they try to swipe at you with their staff.\nOnce defeated, you'll gain a Knot of Voidness, and a Monkey-Head Fungus Seed to take back to the Zodiac Village, as well as their Fungiwoman Spirit to absorb.\nFungiwoman\nBe sure to check the shack on the far end before leaving, as you'll find the **Sunset of the Nine Skies Drink** sittng on a table, which will restore Qi as well as health!\nAs you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple.
