As with previous Secret Areas, this one has its own separate shop where you can purchase things not found in the rest of the Webbed Hollow, which can help you toward crafting better weapons and armor:\nPurple Cloud Mountain Shrine Shop\n---\nTiger Subduing Pellets (x3) - 360 Will | Antimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will | |\nCold Iron Leaves (x2) - 900 Will | Fine Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will | Refined Iron Sand (x4) - 1200 Will | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Will\nGentian (x5) - 90 Will | Tree Pearl (x3) - 180 Will | Jade Lotus (x3) - 90 Will | Snake-Head Mushroom (x3) - 120 Will\nThe area before you is larger than you might expect, and a little confusing to navigate at first. One of two large peaks lies across the bridge near the Shrine, with paths to the left and right.\nThere's also a small pond below the bridge featuring a few materials to harvest and a green Wisp to absorb right under the bridge, and another on the far right side.\nIf you take the path left after crossing the bridge, you'll find that it leads along the main path where you can find a Tree Pearl, and nearby another tree will spring to life!\nThe Lushleaf is a tree spirit that attacks fairly slowly, either stomping down or swinging its head in wide arcs to hit you -- though it can also perform a surprisingly fast low sweeping kick.\nIf you notice it make a strange gesture with its hands, it will summon two smaller tree-like enemies to assist it that can also perform a variety of kicks, but have much less health.\nWatch for a Dragonfly Guai hiding in a left alcove as you move further up the path, and you'll find a large archway gate guarded by an empowered Snake Herbalist. Before charging in, you may notice a sloping path to the left of the gate where an archer waits, but there's another path just to the right across from where the Dragonfly Guai was.\nThis leads up to yet another Dragonfly Guai archer overlooking the gate who will ambush you if you try to attack the snake or his other archer friend.\nTry taking this foe out first, and you'll find a winding path leading up to the peak, across a fallen tree trunk to a high peak, where you'll find a wooden **Treasure Chest** next to the fallen log that holds the **Gold Sun Crow Curio** (bolstering its effect when paired with the Jade Moon Rabbit!).\nFrom here you can head down across the top of the archway gate where a green Wisp floats, allowing you to come back down to ambush the other archer and then take out the strong snake to gain the Snake Herbalist Spirit.\nGoing directly through the archway leads to yet another gate and the Shrine to the next main area, so first head right under the large tree trunk platform above.\nYou'll find another Lushleaf among the bushes here by a Tree Pearl, with multiple pathways ahead. Going directly ahead leads to yet another Shrine, but be sure to look to the right first near the large pond where you first entered to find a larger empowered Lushleaf.\nAs you might expect, this one will take a lot longer to kill with its strengthened spirit, so expend your big hits and spirit attacks, making sure to stop and take out whatever minions he summons. When he finally falls, you'll get the Verdant Glow Spirit, which allows you to heal rather than invoke an attack.\nBe sure to also look at the normal tree near where the Lushleaf was meditating. It has a **Luojia Fragrant Vine** wrapped around it that you can claim.\nPurple Mountain Luojia Fragrant Vine",
