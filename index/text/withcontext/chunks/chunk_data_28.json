    "h2_content": "As you reach the site of the Shrine, you’ll need to deal with an angry Crow Diviner who guards it (these types of enemies don’t respawn, thankfully). Be wary of their fast reverse blade swings and jumping claw kicks, and rest up after they’ve been defeated.\nThe main path lies up the stairs to the right, but be sure to look in the awning over to the left of the shrine first for some pots to break. Technically, you can find a big shortcut by simply jumping over the rocks to the nearby canyon stream, but there’s important things to find while taking the main route first.\nThe most important of which is just up the stairs and to the right before reaching a large bridge. A strange human man with a giant gourd on his back will be reciting poetry and drawing with his back to you.\nAs you approach, he’ll ask if you’ve seen the nameless souls in your travels - referring to the green wisps floating about that only offer a small amount of Will as they fly away. The wise master will take your gourd and inscribe a blessing on it, allowing you to absorb wayward spirits. This will allow you to finally capture the floating green wisps to not only gain much more Will, but also slightly replenish your Gourd’s healing charges.\nEven more importantly, you’ll now find that certain enemies will leave behind departed Spirits that can be claimed, and allow you to temporarily transform into them to unleash a specific attack. Unlike the Red Waves spell, these Spirits can be equipped to a special slot, and will become charged as you fight and earn Qi. Once the bar is filled, you can then unleash their attack by holding the right trigger and then the left trigger (R2/RT + L2/LT).\nThere’s a chance you may already have one such Spirit, if you decided to test your might early — against the Wandering Wight in the Forest of Wolves. If you already defeated him but were unable to claim his purple spirit, return to a Shrine and you’ll find it under the Retrieve Spirits option, and can then equip it in your inventory.\nIf you haven’t yet defeated him, now is a great time to try again — and you can also grab the other wandering green spirit wisps that evaded your grasp the first time around (they’ll reappear after resting):\n* Below the very first bridge in the Front Hills\n* Near the arena where you fought Guangzhi and learned the Red Tides spell\n* At the Guanyin Temple entrance by the Shrine in front of a wolf statue altar\n* Back down the path in the Bamboo Grove where the falls are\nWhen you’re ready to proceed, head across the large bridge to find a new type of enemy, the Snake Patroller. These spear-wielding snake-men will stand up straight up before lunging at you with a bite that inflicts major damage while poisoning you, which may force you to use Anti-miasma powder to negate its effects. They can also put their spear in their teeth and dash with it held horizontally to swing it about in a combo attack.\nOnce you’ve cleared the snake, check out the next area to find another Snake-Head Mushroom, and continue along the path to a field of bones. Three bodies will come to life as Skeletal Snakes. Thankfully, since it takes a moment for them to come to life, and they are fairly weak, they’ll fall to only a couple of staff strikes — usually before they can try to grab at you.\nHeading down the trail from the Skeletal Snakes, you’ll find a stream where another Snake Patroller wanders, as well as an optional area you can investigate by following the stream instead of going under the bridge (though you should still look just past the bridge to find green wisp spirits to capture for a huge amount of Will).\nThis path leads to a marshy swamp area full of tall white reed flowers. Several Croaky enemies hide within them, so use your lock-on to identify them so you aren’t ambushed. However, as you make your way through the marsh toward a large stone mural in the cliffs, an optional mini-boss will leap out to fight you.\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\nA gargantuan Yaoguai Toad, Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang will waste no time leaping into battle with a powerful slam attack from the air. While he doesn’t have many moves, they can often land extremely quickly, which means you’ll need to be ready to dodge at any moment.\nHis most standard attack includes a series of swipes with both arms that sends him forward, ending in a small leaping splash attack that allows him to reposition. By dodging the first swipe to the side, you can wait for him to leap back towards you and then use Immobilize to keep in place while you attack. He can also use any of these swipes and slams independently as well as in a three-hit combo, so look for a follow-up attack before deciding to commit to countering with your own attacks.\nThere are two extremely fast and damaging attacks you’ll need to beware of. The first comes when he’s directly facing you, and the toad will pause momentarily lowering his arms across his chest. He’ll then lunge at you belly first in an extremely quick dash, and you’ll have to dodge the body slam quickly to the side before striking back.\nBe wary when dodging around to his back, or when you see him reposition himself by hopping and turning his body. Instead of landing from the hop, he’ll spring out his legs with surprising reach to perform a frog leg kick with massive power, and can use it twice in a row!\nFinally, he can unleash a tongue attack that sweeps back and forth with a large reach several times, and will require you to dodge back and forth out of its path — or use your Immobilize to stop him in the act. Using your Red Tide spell to transform can also help out during these attacks as he’ll be vulnerable to getting hit from the side.\nWhen Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang finally falls, he’ll leave behind his purple Spirit and a Tadpole Material. Using your new Blessed Gourd upgrade, you can now absorb the Spirit and add Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang’s power to your own, and temporarily transform to unleash a tongue attack against several enemies. If you decide to commit to cultivating his spirit and upgrading its damage potential, you can use the Tadpole he dropped to further upgrade it later on.\nBaw-Li-Guhh-Lang\nFrom the mini-boss lair, you can head past where the toad emerged from to the right to find a path with a green wisp Spirit you can absorb for a decent amount of Will. Past this is a Snake-Head Mushroom, and a ledge that will lead down to a larger central area that the main path also leads to.\nThis bamboo forest is full of various Snake Patrollers, and a great amount of Skeletal Snake bones lying in wait and just waiting to ambush you as the bones awaken. Because of this, it’s best to proceed slowly through this region and alert the snakes one by one, defeating them as they come alive, and luring the living Snake Patrollers backward so your fights don’t attract more attention.\nThere’s just a few materials to find in this large circular grove, including more Snake-Head Mushroom — and one by a broken stone brazier that is actually a Fungiling in disguise. Much like the Ginsengling, these plant-head monsters are fairly durable and hit hard with a poleblade, so try to shut them down with Immobilize to press the attack while you can.\nTo proceed, look for a small dirt path lined by a few fires through the bamboo grove to a set of statues on either side of a small opening in the walls. On the other side, another large bamboo grove is home to a humble yet deadly Yaoguai Chief.\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Guangmou\nGuangmou is one of the more tricky fights you’ll have faced so far, relying on a variety of sneaky projectile attacks to keep you on the defensive and limit your ability to pursue him. Though he’s not technically a snake, you will find yourself in danger of being poisoned during this fight, so you may want to buy a few anti-poison medicine from the Shrine’s shop.\nHe’ll almost always begin the fight by summoning a cluster of homing ghostly projectiles that burst out of him before tracking you down. You can avoid the group by dodging to the side, or holding down your staff spin until they’ve been deflected.\nHowever, Guangmou will usually create these as a distraction, and teleport up close to you while you’re busy trying to dodge his projectiles. Once he’s up close, beware of his poison spitting attack where he sprays in a large area in front of him.\nHis other main projectile attack comes out much faster, as he levitates off the ground for a moment before shooting out a line of the spells in front of him. They don’t track you like the others, but they will shoot rapidly downward and into the ground in front of him.\nWhen he’s got some range on you, listen up for some of his call-outs. If he yells “Storm forth!” he’ll soon create a gusty orb surrounded by leaves that will slowly float toward you. This one can’t be deflected since it won’t do damage on its own. Once it reaches your position, the gust will issue forth and in a moment become a small violent tornado that will knock you down!\nAn interesting note is that he needs to control the orb’s direction, meaning you can cast Immobilize when he summons the orb to lock both him and his projectile in place, nullifying the attack!\nSometimes, he won’t even bother with the orb, and will simply wave his fan rapidly to create a tornado at your last known position, so staying mobile and pressing your attack can help you avoid these attacks.\nEasily the most annoying move in his repertoire is when he calls out to his “Boys”. He’ll then summon a number of poisonous snakes out of the ground all over the arena, who will all spit venom at you around 5-6 times before vanishing. While they technically do have health bar, it’s not worth engaging with any of them — giving you two viable options: Run and dodge like crazy, or find a corner of the arena where you can see them all, and use your staff spin to nullify the projectiles. This last trick won’t last forever due to the stamina drain, and also due to Guangmou’s meddling during the summons, but it can provide a temporary respite.\nThe good news is other than his poison spray, Guangmou doesn’t really have any melee attacks to defend himself at close range — other than a very slow repulsing explosion he needs to charge up by spinning while he gathers energy. Use this to your advantage by pressing your light attack combos whenever you close the gap, and if you have defeated the Wandering Wight, use its Spirit Attack to knock him down with a mighty headbutt to keep him from teleporting away.\nAnother good strategy to note is that if you’re in danger of getting close to becoming poisoned, using the Red Tides spell can help you transform out of danger. Any status effects suffered while transformed as Guangzhi will be removed when you regain your regular health bar. As an added bonus, Guangmou will even comment on your transformation.\nOnce you’ve learned how to evade his projectiles, the rest of the fight will just boil down to chasing him down and stunning him however you can with Immobilize, your Spirit Attack, and other heavy hits. When he falls, you’ll gain Guangmou’s Spirit to add to your collection, allowing you to summon venomous snakes of your own!\nGuangmou",
