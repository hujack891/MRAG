    "h2_content": "There’s only a few places left to explore that comprise the Yellow Wind Formation, and all roads lead to the Windseal Gate. You found one route after defeating the Stone Vanguard that led down the sloping sand canyon to the gate itself, but there’s more doors we haven’t unlocked with the Sterness of Stone and Keeness of Tiger.\nReturn to where you fought the King of Flowing Sand and his Second Prince son, and unlock the large stone door here. You’ll find stairs leading down here, with a spot to the left leading back to another door that’s actually a shortcut to the Valley of Despair’s cave where you fought the First Prince.\nFurther down the stairs, there’s a large broken building to the right, and a Spearbone guarding a rope bridge up ahead. New enemies are lurking underneath the ruined building — Weasel Captains.\nThese quick enemies are tiny and easy to miss as they dart around you, looking for opportunities to lunge at you with their small swords. Luckily, they aren’t as overwhelming or powerful as the Civet Sergeants, so long as you don’t attract the attention of all of them at once.\nOn the other side of the ruined building, there’s a long roof-like walkway and several Withering Corpses milling about, along with a Ginsengling hiding by a wooden chest that holds 3 **Yaoguai Core**.\nIf you already used the Old Rattle-Drum back in Windrest Hamlet, you’ll again hear the spirit of a boy call out to you. Use the drum here, and prepare to fend off the zombies as he speaks to you. Interestingly, he mentions a secret and a well before clamming up, giving you one final clue to the third location.\nThere are many small wells that dot the Yellow Sand Ridge area, but the one you need to seek out is located back in Sandgate Village. Head back to the area where you fought the Earth Wolf and rescued the Horse Guai who was tied up by the large statue.\nLook to the left of that statue altar, and you’ll find a small field around the back with a concerning amount of skeletons, and a well. Using the Rattle-Drum here one final time will cause the spirit of the boy to appear before you, and invite you to hop down the well to meet a “friend”.\nUnfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there. You can interact with the well to drop down to a secret area, where you’ll face off against an incredibly tough and dangerous Mad Tiger Miniboss (who may even be tougher than all the other Tigers you’ve faced)!\nReturning to the second spot you ed the Rattle-Drum in Yellow Wind Formation, cross the rope bridge and you’ll contend with a few more Weasel Captains.\nRounding the corner, you can spot a large tree in the distance with telltale glow of a collectible hanging from it, but guarding it is a very creepy and unique miniboss.\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Gore-Eye Daoist\nThe Gore-Eye Daoist is not like most bosses you’ve faced, what with the creepy fleshy thing on his back full of eyeballs. This boss has a speciality - and it’s creating blood. Lots of it. This blood can be pretty dangerous too, as he’ll be able to create pools of it all around the arena, and even poison you with it, so make sure you’re stocked on a few antimiasma pills.\nWhen the fight begins, he’ll begin a loud cry, punctuated by slamming his staff into the ground that will cause several pools of blood to splash down all around him. If you’re caught in the blast, expect to be instantly poisoned, so be ready to dodge away the moment his staff slams down.\nThere’s many more ways he can create more blood pools, and not all of them look the same. Sometimes he’ll dance about and ring his staff, shooting them out in all directions and ending with a shockwave of bloody force you need to dodge.\nUp close, the Gore-Eye Daoist can only employ a few staff swings that don’t hit hard, and will regularly rely on his blood spells to keep you at bay.\nOne of these blood spells is to basically turn his staff into a firehose, and he’ll spray blood in a frontal arc around him to force you to back off, creating several new pools at his feet. Depending on your positioning, you can either try to dodge behind him, or take a retreating jump and follow up with the thrust stance heavy attack outside of his range.\nHe’ll have a few more variations of expelling blood from his staff - either in a concentrated stream straight ahead, or flinging his staff to create a wave of it in front of you, so be ready for waves of blood to fly out whenever he charges up.\nIf you see him begin to lean back and shake his staff over his head, prepare for him to create several more blood projectiles to shoot out of the eyes on his back. They’ll track your position and fly in an arc towards you, so be ready to dodge or employ your staff spin to destroy the projectiles before they can poison you.\nThe most annoying part will be when he hunches over and starts to mumble. Lines of red will start appearing from the eyes on his back toward each of the blood pools he’s created, and will essentially suck the pools back in and regenerate a portion of health. Stop him the moment you see this with a well timed Immobilize, or try a Spirit with a mighty attack to stagger him out of it, otherwise the fight will just go on longer.\nTry to keep him boxed in if possible — getting his back stuck to a wall can severely limit how much blood he can expel from his eyeballs, and stop the projectiles from seeking you out. Use stunning, staggering, and heavy hits to keep him off-balance and unable to cast his spells, and he’ll fall before long.\nDefeating him will earn you his Gore-Eye Daoist Spirit to absorb, and you can also help yourself to the second Luojia Fragrant Vine in this chapter to boost your gourd yet again!\nGore-Eye Daoist\nBeyond a Lingzhiling hiding in the corner of this area, there’s not much else, so with the miniboss defeated you can find a path heading down past a green Wisp to absorb, leading you back to the Windseal Gate. This is the same spot you slid down to after defeating the Stone Vanguard, and gained the Pluck of Many spell, and can now open the gate with the Sterness of Stone and Keeness of Tiger.\nOn the other side, you can spy the path leading back up to where the Xu Dog crafts medicines under the Crouching Tiger Temple on the far side of this area.\nTo the left, you can find a path leading to a grotto and a familiar face, the Wise Master who imbued your gourd with the power to absorb Spirits.\nHe’ll have a few more wise words to impart (hinting at the existence of the Loong Scale we picked up in the Valley of Despair), and you can also find a Meditation Spot near him to gain one last free Skill Point.\nThe Grotto, Yellow Wind Meditation Spot\nThe only other path leads directly into the heart of the black tornado that dominates the landscape, so when you’re ready to face the final boss of this chapter, head on in!",
