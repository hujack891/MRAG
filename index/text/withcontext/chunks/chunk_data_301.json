Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Valley Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Flint Chief\n* Yaoguai Chief - Cloudy Mist, Misty Cloud\n* **Rakshasa Palace**\n* **The Emerald Hall**\n* Yaoguai King - Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and Yin-Yang Fish\n* Yaoguai Chief - Crimson-Silver Cart\nAfter jumping down from the cliff at the end of Woods of Ember, you'll land in the waters at the start of Furnace Valley. Immediately turn to the right, to pick up the first green Wisp in the region.\nGo straight up toward the valley, but be careful as you explore the area. Some of the rocks in this area glow with lava, and that's because they're actually Searing-Fire enemies. These resemble the Palestones from Chapter 2 and are particularly annoying. They will leap in the air and drop on their back and front to cause explosions. For the sake of unlocking portraits, you can defeat just one and ignore the others.\nContinue straight up, following the gold trail to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine. It's protected by an Earth Rakshasa, so either use heavy attacks to break down its shield, or get behind it to tackle it. When you've dealt with it, activate the Keeper's Shrine.\n### Return to the Pale-Axe Stalwart\nNow that you've beaten two of the Five Element Carts, return to the Camp of Seasons Keeper's Shrine and revisit the Pale-Axe Stalwart. Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration.",
    "h2_content": "From The Emerald Hall Keeper's Shrine, go left and up the stairs. A cutscene will start to , where you'll transform into a Cicada and fly toward the center of the hall. This is where you'll find Pingping speaking to her mother, Rakshasi, accompanied by the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains.\nAfter they discuss The Destined One obtaining the relics, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains offers to care for Rakshashi, which Pingping protests. After he binds Pingping, Rakshashi is revealed to be Zhu Bajie transformed and it's time to take on the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains for yourself.\n### Yaoguai King - Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and Yin-Yang Fish\nThe Keeper of the Flaming Mountains will transport you to another place, in a monochrome illusion where he uses the power of yin-yang. Zhu Bajie will be there to help you at first, so focus on attacking the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains as quickly as you can. This is a two-phase fight, and as you might expect, the second phase is where the action really begins.\nIn the first phase, try to hold off on using your spells as much as you can. Instead, try to be aggressive and relentlessly attack the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains while he's on the ground.\nHe will start to attack using white projectiles, which can be dodged or outrun. When you've got his health down to around 60-70%, he will use the white and black orbs to summon undead enemies.\nThe white revenants are large enemies with clubs, while the black revenants are archers. These are the ones you want to target, as their ranged attacks can be annoying and do the most damage. Clear these revenants out as quickly as possible, to get it back to a fight against just the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains.\nWhen you've got his health down to around 30%, Zhu Bajie will leave you to take him on one-on-one. The aim is still to just attack normally to get his health bar down quickly.\nWhen he's almost dead, he will then summon Ma Tianba for you to fight against.\n### Missable Transformation Spell\nAs we mentioned earlier, at the start of Furnace Valley there is a dead cart. You need to pull the string and exhaust the dialogue from the horse guai Ma Tianba before you defeat him in this fight. Otherwise, you will miss out on the Dark Thunder Transformation Spell. Once you've beaten the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and the Yin-Yang Fish, return to the cart and pull the string to get the Transformation Spell.\nMa Tianba uses a whip and has his own health bar that resembles a normal enemy's health bar. The fight is fairly straightforward in this first phase, but as soon as you've defeated the horse guai, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains drops the Yin-Yang Fish into the water.\nThe giant creature soon emerges and will begin attacking. It has a variety of moves that you'll see it perform during the fight. But the main thing is now you should make use of all your spells and transformations that you saved from the first round.\nYou'll see the Yin-Yang Fish rear itself up from the water and spray a jet at you, or flip itself up and over, to try and hit you with a tail flick. Staying close to it will stop it from being able to hit you with the jet spray, but will make it more likely to try and tail-whip you.\nIt will also use projectiles and throw out orbs to chase you down. These can be dodged or outrun in a similar manner to that of the Keeper of the Flaming Mountain's attacks.\nWhen you've knocked its health down to almost halfway, it will begin to move quite erratically and cover a large amount of distance across the arena. Use Cloudstep to catch up to it and sneakily attack and Immobilize to temporarily halt it from darting off.\nThis is also when it will begin to float up in the air and throw the projectiles down. You'll need to dodge in quick succession to avoid these.\nKeeper of the Flaming Mountains\nOnce you've beaten the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and the Yin-Yang Fish, you'll be returned to The Emerald Hall.\nTurn and face away from the altar. There are two places you'll want to go here to get collectibles. First, head to the stairs, but take the small path down to the right. Follow this to find a golden turtle, where you can get the Slumbering Beetle Husk.\nThen go back to the stairs and head for the balcony (facing opposite the altar in The Emerald Hall). Turn to the right, and go up the stairs to find the Meditation Spot.\nThe Buddha, Emerald Hall Meditation Spot\nNow go back to The Emerald Hall and up to the altar near where you respawned. Collect the Loong Balm drink from the altar then turn left.\nTo continue along the main path head up the stairs and onto the ashen path. Follow it up and around to the left, crossing over the bridge and heading toward the archway in the distance.\nStep through the archway and look to the left to see a treasure chest. Open this to find Blood of the Iron Bull and gold pieces. Proceed up the stairs to the right, past the bull guard, and fire will start to rain down on you -- which you know means another cart is not far off!\nTake the stairs up to the right and follow these up and into the dark cave. Then go right again, and up the next set of stairs to find the Crimson-Silver Cart\n### Yaoguai Chief - Crimson Silver Cart\nIf you've exhausted all the dialogue with the Pale-Axe Stalwart so far, the first thing you'll notice is that you've got his help when it comes to beating this boss.\nThe only real difference between this fight and the one with the previous carts is that the Crimson-Silver Cart has a wider area that it attacks in. Not only will it shoot flames out at the bottom all around it, but it will also roll around and try to mow you down.\nAs soon as you see smoke start to build around it, you'll want to move out of its way, because this is when the fire is coming. Beyond that, you'll also notice tweaks to the punching attacks. Rather than just slamming its fists down once, it will try to land a combo of punches.\nTo make the fight easier, use Immobilize to keep the cart locked in place. That way, you and the Pale-Axe Stalwart can work together to quickly whittle down its health.\nCrimson-Silver Cart\nAfter the fight, speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart again and exhaust his dialogue. Then go along the tree trunk near him to collect the green Wisps that sit on it.\nReturn to the main path and follow this up the mountain. You'll come to a set of stairs, with a Rhino Flame Master at the top of it.\nContinue up the stairs to the left, and follow the rocky path up to the top of the mountain, where you'll reach the Ashen Pass III Keeper's Shrine and be ready to take on the Field of Fire.\nIf you haven't already, go back to the Valley Entrance to get the Dark Thunder Transformation Spell from Ma Tianba in the dead cart. You'll know when you arrive if you'll get the spell, as he'll tell you to come closer before his soul departs. This time, the option to Pull Forcefully will appear. Pull the whip and you'll receive the Dark Thunder spell.\nFurnace Valley Complete",
