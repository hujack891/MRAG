    "h2_content": "The Stone Vanguard is one of two bosses you must defeat to advance to the end of Chapter 2, and defeating it is no easy task. As a hulking monster of rock, the Stone Vanguard employs lots of tremor attacks and huge shockwaves whenever it slams its giant front arms down — which is most of the time. Cloud Step can be very useful for getting out of the way of incoming leaps, and then blindsiding it from the side to stagger it off of its current attack.\n### Secret - Get Help from the Shigandang\nIf you find yourself having trouble with the **Stone Vanguard** , it is possible to get some assistance from the most unlikely source: Another Yaoguai King found in the same boss arena.\nIf you've collected all six Buddha Eyeballs, you can actually interact with the large rock to the left before engaging the Stone Vanguard. This will summon the mighty Shigandang boss to arise and immediately fight with the Stone Vanguard. The good news is he's a lot tougher than the Stone Vanguard, and will perform a flashy finisher to tear the other rock Guai to pieces, giving you all the rewards!\nThe bad news is once the Stone Vanguard is gone, the Shigandang will turn on you, and he is an extremely tough boss to fight this early, so only do this if you really don't want to fight the Stone Vanguard yourself! You can also resummon the Shigandang later for a fairer matchup once you've gotten stronger.\nWhen the fight starts you’ll need to watch out for an incoming leaping strike with one of its front arms, which it will usually follow up by rearing up and then slamming down with both arms pulled out around its front.\nIt’s these major slamming attacks you’ll need to be extra careful, and watch closely for when its front arms begin to glow. These types of attacks mean his arms will soon have a delayed detonation, and are designed to bait you into countering early and getting caught in the blast. Instead, hang back and use the Thrust Stance if possible to unleash a charged hit from a safe distance to the side, as the detonation will also trigger rocks to rip upwards in front of him.\nWhile the explosion and rocky spikes can be dodged with good timing — it’s also possible to negate the effect by using your charged Pillar Stance. When done at a reasonable distance, you’ll simply ignore the tremor below you, and can follow up with a charged strike that often staggers the monster. However, if you try to create a pillar too close to his hands, the explosion can send you tumbling, though it usually absorbs the damage.\nIn an alternative attack, he’ll slam down with both arm points straight up, meaning the detonation will cover a larger wide circle on all sides of him, instead of just a frontal cone. Again, you can use the Pillar Stance with enough lead time to heft yourself over the tremor and attack from above.\nIf you watch him raise both arms to the side in a half-swing motion, he’ll begin to stab the ground repeatedly, alternating his arms four times, before raising both arms high for a ground-bursting blast with both of his arms.\nFinally, the Stone Vanguard has a rather unique attack signaled by him tapping the ground repeatedly with one arm. This will summon a horde of Rock Guai to burrow up out of the ground and launch themselves at you in a steady succession, exploding on impact. You’ll need to either backpedal and take evasive action, or use Cloud Step to get the slip on them. Be warned that as the last two make their leap attack, the Stone Vanguard will join in requiring you to time your evasion right.\nYou can also try transforming into the Rock Guai yourself with the Azure Dust. Just remember that you only build Might by getting hit, and the slow pace of his attacks may make that hard unless he’s going for his more rapid arm stamping attack. If you do get a full Might bar, you can unleash a devastating “Rockfall” attack that will take off a good deal of this bosses health bar!\nDefeating the Stone Vanguard will reward you with the Sterness of Stone, one half of the items you need to activate the tallies that unlock the large door to the chapter’s main boss.\nStone Vanguard\nNote - This arena is actually home to more than one boss, and it’s hiding in plain sight. Near the entrance you came in through the large archway, there’s a large stone on the side, and on closer inspection has many heads carved into it. Draw close, and you’ll be able to interact with it, inserting the six Buddha Eyeballs you gained from the statue heads around the Fright Cliff. Doing so will unlock the Shigandang secret boss battle. It’s a much tougher fight than the Stone Vanguard, and we recommend saving it for the tail end of this chapter, either after you’ve cleared it or are close to doing so.",
