This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor.",

Continue all the way to the back right corner of the lake to find the Soak sitting in a container.\nStranded Loong's Whisker\nSoaks are far more plentiful than the drinks for your gourds. They are scattered throughout the game, across each chapter. For even more guides on these areas, check out our full Black Myth: Wukong walkthrough.
