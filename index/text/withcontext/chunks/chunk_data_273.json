    "h2_content": "Facing the Keeper's Shrine, fly up from it and look to the right. Get as high as you can, and you'll see a large rock. Head straight toward it and over it, then continue past and turn slightly to the right again.\nIn the midst of the trees, there's a small patch of ground with no grass. The Poison Chief can be found here.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 2\nThankfully, each of the Poison Chief fights is pretty much the same. You can expect the same moveset and should prepare for them in the same way.\nPoison Chief 2\nWhen the second Poison Chief is down, return to the Rhino Watch Slope and then head into the area with the flames on the ground. A cutscene will  out as you get there, and the Gold Armored Rhino will appear.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Gold Armored Rhino\nThe key to making this fight as easy as possible is to break the Rhino's horn. You want to do this as quickly as possible, so we'd recommend going in with the Wandering Wight Spirit equipped. Speed is essential here, as you'll need to hit the Rhino head-on to break the horn.\nOnce its horn is broken, it’ll try to get away from you. Use Immobilize if needed to keep the Rhino in place, then quickly use Wandering Wight to smash the horn. Follow this up with Pluck of Many and the Plantain Fan to knock the Rhino over repeatedly and overwhelm it with your duplicates.\nWhen you can't use the Wandering Wight, you need to build focus quickly. Alternatively, just keep holding charge until you’ve built your focus up. If you’re building your focus up naturally, then it’s worth using Immobilize when it's ready again to get the Rhino to stand still so you'll have more chance of hitting your target. You don't want to waste your attacks in this, otherwise, you could be in for a lengthy fit.\nThough you can do damage by hitting the Rhino in other areas, there’s little point in doing so unless you want the fight to last a long time. If you miss hitting the horn, you can still attack it. Avoid hitting its face and instead focus on hitting it from behind. This will annoy it, and it will buck to try and kick you with its back legs.\nBut if you’re holding charge to build it up, wait until the Rhino is coming toward you or pauses for a moment, and then unleash the attack. One of the best times to hit is when it's moving slowly, with sparks appearing around its horn.\nUnfortunately, it won't be very long until lots of lightning starts to appear around the Rhino. When this happens, it will rear up and more lightning will start to strike the ground all around the field. This means that the horn is about to regrow, and you'll need to prepare to break it again.\nBeyond this, expect attacks where it will charge at you. There are rocks you can use in the arena to hide behind for a little while. However, once these are destroyed, you'll need to dodge out of the way. When it's close to you, it will also try to swipe at you by pulling its head back, then swinging it to the side to catch you with its horn. These are great moves to dodge and build up focus if you've unlocked the ability to do so in the skills tab.\nLastly, you can expect a few projectile attacks from the Rhino as well. When it puts its horn down to the ground and drags along it, it will flick rocks up at you. Usually, these are five rocks at a time and you can move out of the way of them easily if you're not too close to the Rhino.\nThe fight is very much a rinse-and-repeat situation, where you'll just want to try and hit the horn as much as you can to try and break it.\nGold Armored Rhino\nAfter defeating the Golden-Armored Rhino you'll gain the Gold Suozi Armor, which is the second part of Wukong's Set.\nFly up again when the battle is done and head for the edge of the cliff (the opposite side to the Keeper's Shrine and where you entered the fight).\nWhen you get to the edge, look down to see a muddy clearing. Down here, you can find the next optional boss, which is the final frog Lang-Baw-Baw.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Baw-Baw\nWhen you first drop in on Lang-Baw-Baw, a load of soldiers will also appear. You can ignore these and let Lang-Baw-Baw tackle them; they make for a good distraction so you can focus on hitting the frog while it attacks the soldiers.\nWhen it comes to the one-to-one with Lang-Baw-Baw, you can expect to see the same type of moves that the previous frog bosses have used (if you've taken them all down so far). Expect to see it use its tongue as a whip to try and hit you, which you can dodge and dash away from. It will also leap up and try to belly flop you, as well as use its back kicks to quickly lash out when you're behind it.\nThe big difference with Lang-Baw-Baw is that you need to watch the color of its body to know when it's best to attack and in what way. When its body is red, it's vulnerable to attack. In this state, you'll do the most damage, so you'll want it to stay like this for as long as possible.\nAfter a certain amount of time, he will solidify, turn brown, and become like stone. If you hit him during this state, your attacks will bounce off of him, though they will do minimal amounts of damage. When he's like this, he will start to use rocks to attack. He can also roar, which will momentarily stun you and damage you at the same time.\nExpect to see him using rocks like shockwaves, where he'll punch the ground and disturb the ground underneath you, and also call rocks up into the air. When this happens, he'll roar and send them hurtling toward you. Another variation of a rock attack he performs is that a circle of rocks will spike up from the ground on occasion.\nThe key is to get him out of this state as soon as possible because it can be an annoying fight otherwise. It's easy to be killed when you're being bombarded with rock attacks in this phase. You can perform heavy attacks when he's in this phase, and you'll knock him flat and still do plenty of damage. But the best thing you can do is throw out the Plantain Fan. He'll go back to being red immediately, and be repeatedly pushed back. Stick close to him when the fan is hitting to keep attacking.\nIf he goes back into this state when you don't have the fan available, it's just a matter of hanging back and avoiding attacks until he changes back to red.\nLang-Baw-Baw\nWhen you've beaten Lang-Baw-Baw, fly up again and look to the opposite side of the water. You'll see red trees in the distance, but it's the area on the right you'll want to go to first.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 3\nAs you get close to the edge of the cliff, you'll find another clearing with a rock in the middle. This is the third Poison Chief in the region.\nPoison Chief 3\nWhen you've beaten the third Poison Chief, head over to the start of the red trees. As you enter the clearing with the lightning, you'll find the next Keeper's Shrine on the left.",
