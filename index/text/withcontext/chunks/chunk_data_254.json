    "h2_content": "Head up the slope to see Pingping speak to her father. The Bull King isn't best pleased with The Destined One, but also has an issue with Pingping and her deception. It turns out that Pingping is actually the Red Boy, and he will transform before your eyes, ready for a battle.\n### Yaoguai King - Red Boy\nThe Red Boy is incredibly agile, and he'll move quickly around the clearing, twisting and turning to lunge at you using his spear. However, his combos are thankfully short, so you'll only need to dodge a couple of times to avoid these swiping attacks and be able to follow up with your own.\nThat being said, if you're lucky, you'll experience moments where he actually stands still for a few seconds, preparing to attack. Take advantage of these opportunities when they present themselves, to get in as many hits as possible before he starts a combo of fire assaults.\nWhen he does stand still -- or he's pausing from his own combos -- you won't be able to finish a combo of your own. It's best to just get a few hits in, then immediately jump back. This is because he'll breathe fire in a small arc directly in front of him as soon as you've hit him a few times.\nAs you'd expect from the final boss of The Flaming Mountains, the Red Boy uses a weapon imbued with fire and projectile fire attacks. For this reason, we'd recommend you stock up on Body-Cooling Powder and equip your Fireproof Mantle to help you should you start to take too much elemental damage.\nWhen he winds his staff to create a ring of fire, the attack looks a lot worse than it actually is. He'll throw out the ring toward you and it will start to bounce around the clearing. Keep track of it by looking up and following it to stay away from where it lands. If you keep moving, it's fairly easy to avoid. After bouncing around a few times, the Red Boy will slam down into the ground to recover the spear. There's a brief pause here while he composes himself, so you'll be able to rush in to attack.\nIf he performs the combination of moves where he twirls the spear around him, he'll perform a leap and thrust his spear into the ground, then flip toward you. When he does this, he'll follow it up immediately with a flamethrower from his hand. It's best to dodge all of this moveset, then attack.\nThough it's tempting to create distance, it's better to stay close to the Red Boy during this fight. Not only will this allow you to take advantage of those pauses we mentioned previously, but it also means he's less likely to use projectiles. If you're too far away, he'll shoot fire along the ground to try and reach you.\nWhen his health reaches the halfway point, he'll launch himself up in the air. Shortly after, he'll create duplicates of himself that will appear all around him. These will launch themselves at you with their spears, resulting in an explosion. It'll start with one duplicate launching themselves at you, then two, and finally, a set of three will attack.\nThe best way to approach this is to stay locked on the Red Boy, but move as far back in the area as you can. If you need to, use any rocks nearby that haven't been destroyed. You can then dodge in any direction to evade the attacks and do a quick double tap of dodge when you have multiple duplicates coming at you. If you're finding it difficult to dodge the attacks, Cloudstep can help you direct some of the attention away from yourself.\nOnce the duplicates are gone, he will immediately follow with a strong attack. Most of his attacks can actually be interrupted by your own heavy attack, so try to build focus with cautious half-combos or equip items that will let you gain it quickly. Performing heavy attacks will stagger him and stop him from going into certain moves entirely if timed right.\nWhen he's back down on the floor after sending out the duplicates, his attacks will be way more aggressive and he'll be more agile. You'll find that he repeats the same variations of attack, they'll just have a wider reach. For example, he'll spin his spear for longer, resulting in fire emerging around him, and then will leave areas of the ground covered in flames.\nYou can approach the second part of the fight in much the same way you did the first, and if you haven't used too many spells, now is the time to unleash them and get the rest of his health down as soon as possible.\nRed Boy\nAfter being the Red Boy, the Bull King will reveal the stone that was kept in his belly. At the end of the conversation, the Red Boy's body will begin to disappear. But before The Destined One can collect the stone, the Red Boy emerges, showing that he used a False Death Talisman and is actually alive. He consumes the stone and immediately transforms into the Yaksha King.\n### Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\nIf you die during this phase, you do not need to fight the Red Boy again.\nThe Yaksha King will draw two blades from his elbows, which will be angled behind him for the fight. These will glow brightly, and he'll use them traditionally as blades, but also be able to throw our circular projectiles from them.\nZhu Bajie will be helping you out at the start of this fight, so you can use him as a distraction while you get some hits in. It's also wise to try and hold off on healing as much as you can and allow Zhu Bajie to do this for you instead.\nWhen the Yaksha King begins to throw out those circular projectiles, you'll find that these often are around 4-5 at a time. It's best to dodge them by rolling forward, toward the Yaksha King, so you can immediately attack as the last one is dashed.\nThe move that feels like his signature for the fight is one where small blades emerge from the floor (almost grass-like). They are incredibly visible, but they'll only stick out slightly from the ground when he starts to perform the attack. When you see them, you'll have a few seconds to get away from the ring of blades, because they'll shoot up as full-blown spikes in no time.\nWhile it's easy to avoid this move at first, he has another variation that will cover a larger amount of the arena. This will begin with one circle of blades appearing, and then a second one forming as an extension. In this case, you can jump or dodge to avoid the attacks, but the timing of this can be difficult, so running from the area is the most straightforward way to not get caught in this.\nYou'll also find that he performs acrobatics around the arena, and will run up the wall occasionally. When he does this, he'll flip off of the rocks and try to land on you. As he lands, he will also send the blades up from the ground, along with rocks.\nAfter knocking down a chunk of his health, there will be times when he starts to switch to using just one blade. You'll know when this is about to happen, as only one blade will glow brightly, while the other will be dimmed. When he does this, this will mean that the blade will be able to reach much further, and he'll create huge extended arcs with it. He often does this in chains of three and will start to say a word like \"Merciless\" or \"Sheathless\" before each attack. You'll want to learn the timings of this attack, so you can dodge and roll right underneath it each time.\nIn the second part of the fight, he'll become much more aggressive. This will also be when Zhu Bajie leaves the fight. He won't only swing the blade around himself like he did in the first portion of the fight, but he'll also swing the sword overhead and land it down in front of him. When he does this, he'll send out a trail of the grass-like blades. You can dodge the long arcs in the same way you did for the first part of the fight, and dodge side to side to avoid the trail of blades.\nThere's one particular attack in this second half of the fight where he'll charge at you. You'll need to dodge this, otherwise, he'll grab you and a short cutscene will begin. The Yaksha King will pummel The Destined One, and when you restart the fight, you'll see a significant chunk of your health gone.\nYou can approach this fight in a similar way to the Red Boy, in that it's best to save your spells until the second portion. Immobilize works on him, so when he's darting around more in the second half, you can trap him and make it easier to attack. Ebon Flow is also a good spell to use in this fight, as you can block his attacks with the defense option and build up focus to unleash heavy attacks to stagger him.\nYaksha King\nWith the Yaksha King defeated, Zhu Bajie will get him to spit out the relic. Chapter 5 comes to an end with Rakshasi appearing and promising to never leave the mountain again, and handing over the Plantain Fan to the Destined One.\nWith the chapter's end, you'll earn the Grieved Body, and the talents you can pick from it are:\n* **Nimble Body -** Massively reduces the Stamina cost of all charged Heavy Attacks.\n* **Everlasting Vitality -** Considerably increases Maximum Health.\n* **Divine Safeguard -** Considerably increases Four Banes Resistance.\nIt's time to venture to Mount Huago to start the final chapter of Black Myth: Wukong.\nField of Fire Complete",
