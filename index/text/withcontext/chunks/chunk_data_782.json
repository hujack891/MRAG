There's another green Wisp overlooking the pool of water, and scattered Skeletal Snakes all about.\nHead to the far side of the spring where you can find a Lantern Holder patrolling by some cocoons, and a path beyond him leads up to a high ledge guarded by a Dragonfly Guai.\nHowever, if you look to the left up the sloping path, there's another wooden platform leading to a small alcove by the edge of the water, where the small rat you've been seeing in almost every chapter is sitting atop another statue head. Once he flees, inspect it to find your fourth Skandha: The **Skandha of Choice**.\nAt the top of the ledge, watch for a Grasshopeer Guai ambush as you leave a small tunnel, and then confront the archer, who has been empowered by a Spirit. Even with more health, he's still no match when you close the distance, and you'll be able to claim the **Dragonfly Guai Spirit**.\nMoving along the main path, you'll find it guarded by one last Scorpion Prince, so be ready for his charging attacks and quick leaping tail strikes as you bait out opening to counter him. There's a few extra Skeletal Snakes in the vicinity, so beware they don't try and all gang up on you at once!",
