Given there's more optional bosses and enemies to face, it's not a bad idea to go back and rest at the entrance before making a beeline through the side path to return to the main plaza.\nAt the top of the stairs where all the mages were positioned, there's actually not too much to find here. Several Monk Supporters patrol the building exterior, where you can also find a few Overseeing Monks training along the corners.\nThe interior building hides three more Overseeing Monks and a patrolling Dual-Blade Monk, but nothing in the way of actual rewards.\nIf you want to advance to the main boss, the large stairway on the other side of the building will lead you to the Inner Courtyard, but there's another optional side path to explore first, on the opposite side as the other optional path we explored earlier.\nYou can still find another Clay Vajra to battle at the foot of the main stairs. It's a tougher fight than the previous one, and you'll be rewarded for besting it with the Clay Vajra Spirit to add to your collection.\nWhile looking up at the stairs leading up to the pagoda, take the path left to a side stairway going down and guarded by a Thunder Rhino Master.\nBe sure to look to your right after defeating him, and you can spot a wooden platform beyond a tree along the walls that holds a **Treasure Chest** with materials inside.\nHead down the stairs to reach another large building, and a long pathway in front of it. To your right is a small frozen pond under part of a bridge, where another lesser Sea Monk hides along with a green Wisp to absorb.\nTo the left of the building, there's more wooden platforms below the wall where a Wolf Guardian waits near a patrolling Supporter Monk. In the snow-filled corner of this area, you'll find more wooden platforms with another **Treasure Chest** you can loot for random materials.\nHead back to the main building and quickly dart inside to avoid the lightning strikes of the Thunder Rhino Masters on the balcony above.\nThe darkened room is small, and hides another Overseeing Monk, as well as stairs leading upward to the right.\nBeware of more Overseeing Monks as you ascend, and try to stay patient using thrust attacks from out of their range to conserve your health from getting hit by their martial arts counters.\nOnce at the top of the building, be ready for another Overseeing Monk to ambush you, and then head out to the balcony to deal with the lightning mages.\nBefore heading through the doors behind the two mages, look instead for another path along the balcony leading to a large bridge.\nTake this bridge path up to find a massive statue altar at the far end. Standing next to a pillar nearby, you'll have your third meeting with the friendly Horse Guai. It seems he's quite bewitched by Yellowbrow and has lost the will to continue his quest.\nWhile there's nothing you can do to resolve his dilemma (other than beat up Yellowbrow yourself), you can keep talking to him and he'll give you the **Trailblazer's Scarlet Gourd** , a new gourd bottle you can try that grants a full heal on the first swig!\nBe sure to also inspect the small gold box at the foot of the large statue altar, and you'll get the Body-**Fleeting Powder Formula** , plus three extra powders for free that can allow you to fight without expending stamina for a short duration.\nHead back along the bridge and through the balcony to the large doorway, and on the other side you can find a green Wisp to absorb hiding in the corner, and a small ramp leading to a large building at the top of several stone stairs.\nMany Censor Holders pray around this area, but most will ignore you. There's also a lone Overseeing Monk praying to an altar off to the left, which holds another green Wisp to absorb.\nOnce you reach the top of the stairs, you'll find a few small sealed shacks on the side with Overseeing Monks, and the main building entrance guarded by two Thunder Rhino Masters.\nAfter defeating them, you can spot a lone monk standing inside. This is the target of the Snow Fox's quest for revenge, and you can now use the Snow Fox Brush in your inventory to transform into The Fox, and step inside to trigger a cutscene (if you enter first you can speak to him, but transforming near the monk will instantly trigger the fight without a scene).",
