You'll encounter some more of the Searing and Scorching-Flame enemies, as well as a little green Wisp to the right, by the lava lake.\nAs you head into the next barren section, you may notice the glow of a treasure chest up ahead. Be warned that there are also little glowing patches leading up to, and inside the next clearing, and these are all Flamlings. Clear them out before you go over to the chest, where you can collect Refined Iron Sand from it.\nWhen you've looted the chest, go around to the other side of the rock.

Thankfully, Flame Ores are dropped by Flamlings, so you'll hopefully have enough by this point to summon her immediately. Approach the glowing patch and deliver the Flame Ores.\n### Mother of Flamlings Boss Fight and Guide\nThe ground will rumble as the Mother of Flamlings appears, and fireballs will be thrown out as soon as she bursts through the ground. Stand back after delivering the Flame Ores to avoid this attack.\nThese will land on the ground and turn into glowing patches. Unfortunately, these will become Flamlings, so be mindful of these as you run around the arena.\nThe Mother of Flamlings, thankfully, won't move. She'll stay where she is and use ranged fireball attacks, very similar to the Flamlings. To combat this, get as close to her as possible and try to land a few attacks. The downside of this, however, is that she will try to whip you with her body.
