    "h1_content": "The Pagoda Realm is the second main region of Chapter 3 in The New West in Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide for the Pagoda Realm Region, including how to escape the jail, unlock the purple seals, and defeat the Captains.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Lower Pagoda (Level 1)**\n* **Lower Pagoda (Level 2)**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Captain Lotus-Vision\n* **Upper Pagoda (Level 3)**\n* **Upper Pagoda (Level 4**\n* **Mani Wheel**\n* Yaoguai King - Captain Wise-Voice\n* **Outside the Wheel**\n* **Snow-Veiled Trail**\n* **Warding Temple**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\nAfter winning the battle against Kang-Jin Loong, you'll be swept up and thrown into a jail of sorts, in a new region known as The Pagoda Realm. Thankfully you'll be able to open your cell door without much trouble, but it will be long climb to get out of here.\nStepping out into this eerie dungeon, you'll find that this part of the Pagoda Realm is a prison made up of several circular tiers that comprise both an inner walkway ring, and an outer ring for cells, hallways, and stairs -- all circling a large pagoda (and that's not even the titular one) made to look like a mani wheel (or prayer wheel), as its slowly revolving and featuring large statues on every side.\nAs you begin to step out onto the inner walkway, a voice will call out from the next cell, which has a mysterious purple seal you can't break. You can still speak to the person inside, sitting against a wall next to a dead Rat Captain.\nThey'll warn you against trying to make your own way, but you can't exactly do nothing. Still, it pays to heed their warning -- this place is not going to be easy to traverse, especially with minds \"ebbing away with the tides of chants\".\nBe extra wary when exploring this area, as there are many Cyan Bats hiding up on ceilings. They'll divebomb you with little warning, and explode with ice to harass you as you deal with other threats.\nPast the first Cyan Bat, be sure to check the first open cell on the left to find a Wisp to absorb, and a Snake-Head Mushroom to harvest.\n# The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm\nIt's around this point that you'll likely get your first taste of the \"beguiling chants\" the prisoner mentioned, and there's a lot going on you'll have to make sense of. A large terrifying sound will echo throughout the realm, the pagoda itself will spin even faster, everyone will start glowing, strange new creatures will appear -- and your health will start lowering!\nLet's break it down: The Pagoda Realm's chanting curse is on a global timer, meaning even if you die or go to different Shines in the realm, or even sit around resting at a shrine, the curse can still trigger and persist. **Every three minutes, the chanting will begin, and last for exactly one minute and thirty seconds before resetting.**\nDuring this time, your maximum health will be halved! However, there is a silver lining: The curse will actually slowly refill your entire health bar before starting to lower your maximum health bar (but will still account for damage you've taken if you're currently in a fight and not regenerate past that point). As an added caveat, both the Destined One and all other enemies in the Pagoda Realm will start to glow red. This not only makes enemies easier to spot, but also grants everyone a considerable damage boost -- which can be blessing or a curse depending on who you are facing.\nFinally, during this period, strange new enemies will appear along several of the inner ring walkways. These sentries have tall lantern-shaped heads, and will try to grab you and throw you into the pit if they spot you, which is an instant death!The only way to stop this beguiling chant from continuing to manifest is to defeat the boss at the top of the Pagoda, and it will take some work to get there!\nBe wary of Frozen Corpses along this walkway that can come to life and jump at you with their sword, but also of the Lantern Wardens that appear when the beguiling chant's curse begins. There are two in this area, and will slowly patrol back forth while swiveling their heads around casting spotlights on the ground. Should you step in one, you'll be stunned for a moment as they approach to attack. Dodge before they perform their sweeping head attack or you'll be knocked into the realm's pit.\nInstead, use your Immobilize spell to lock them down and try attacking from behind, and watch out for their head slamming attacks.\nIf you see them perform a hand gesture, expect them to disappear, only to reappear from a different angle to try and kick you without warning.",
    "h2_content": "Making your way up the long stairs to the second level, be ready for a Yaksha Archer to take potshots at you from above, and deflect them with some staff-spinning.\nAs you head outside, mind the Frozen Corpse, and look to the left first. There's a nearby open cell door you can find that has a **Treasure Chest** containing a few materials, guarded by a Withered Corpse.\nBeyond this lone cell, you can find the outside walkway path abruptly ends near a Frozen Corpse, and a darkened pit holds a series of rocky platforms you can drop down. The only thing down here at the moment is a cell with a purple seal, and a route back to where you first arrived in the Pagoda Realm, so unless you really want the green Wisp hovering over the drop back down to the start, it's better to leave this area for later.\nBack at the top of the stairs to the second level, head along the outside path to the right this time. The first open cell as you head this direction will have a green Wisp to absorb to replenish some of your gourd's healing charges.\nContinue past the next open area with a Frozen Corpse and Cyan Bat hiding nearby, and you'll pass another cell with a purple seal that holds a strong enemy with a Spirit inside. There's another Cyan Bat guarding this door, and an Abomination not far ahead waiting to lunge at you.\nYou'll need to cross a thin wooden beam next, and to make matters worse, a Yaksha Archer will be posted at the far end to harass you. Resist the urge to perform a mobile Staff Spin, as walking while spinning seems to automatically make you lurch to the side, and you'll plummet to your death.\nInstead, either stop moving to deflect, or take the blows and race to the other side -- but do take a moment to glance to the right at a large purple-lit chamber you can spy ominously through the bars.\nClear out the archer and the nearby Frozen Corpse after you finish crossing (thankfully the archer won't respawn once killed), and grab a nearby green Wisp to absorb before the outside path crumbles away, forcing you to head into the cell tunnel ring to keep moving forward.\nMove slowly through the darkened hall and be ready for ambushes from Abominations, Withered Corpses, and Cyan Bats on the ceiling.\nNot far after them, you'll encounter an Enslaved Yaksha. You can think of him as the Frozen Corpse in his prime, as he uses a similar very long sword, and can sweep in wide arcs with it, or thrust forward with a huge amount of reach. Luckily, his attacks are all very slow, and easily baited into a Rock Solid deflection.\nUp ahead, you'll finally spot the staircase leading up to level 3 that are guarded by an Abomination, but before you head up there's an optional and challenging encounter further down the hall.\nKeep proceeding past the stairs to find a Snake-Head Mushroom to harvest, and look left through an open cell gate to spy a Blade Monk perched outside on the ledge that you can poke off with a thrust attack.\nIf you head to the end of the cells, you'll find a green Wisp to absorb, and a ledge outside leading back down to a small outcropping below with a second green Wisp, and a one-way drop back to the very start (we'd recommend grabbing the next Shrine at the top of the stairs to Level 3 first).\nIf you look to the left of where the Blade Monk was posted to find a section leading back the way you came on the outside ledge. This will lead to a **Treasure Chest** that's guarded by a Yaksha Archer on a high ledge, and a Red-Haired Yaksha in front of the chest.\nThese guys are in a league of their own, and you may even want to wait until your max health is restored if you're currently under the effect of the beguiling chant's curse, as this enemy can kill you extremely quickly. Using their large forearm blade, the Red-Haired Yaksha can employ many strong martial arts attacks, including a sweeping lunge to close the distance in a hurry.\nHe can also fire off three projectiles after a retreating jump, and then follow up with a running kick to stagger you, before assaulting you with a series of sweeping strikes. Especially deadly is a series of two palm strikes with the smaller end of his forearm blade, followed quickly by a backwards jumping bicycle kick that can hit extremely hard without warning.\nIt's not a bad idea to throw off an Immobilize or Cloud Step to bypass the main fighter, and then run to perform a leaping heavy strike to reach the archer and get him out of the way first.\nOnce both combatants are dead, be sure to loot the chest, and head back into the cell tunnel, and upwards to level 3.\nA word of warning: You'll soon spot the telltale trail of gold that means the next Shrine is close at hand, but to reach it, you'll need to pass through one last tunnel section guarded by another Red-Haired Yaksha. If the last encounter proved difficult, you may want to Immobilize or Cloud Step and run past him to get the Shrine, rather than risk having to come all this way again.\nAs you reach the Upper Pagoda Shrine, you might notice a large pit nearby in the cell tunnel, with a familiar purple glow coming from below. You're right above where you crossed the wooden beam, meaning the strange chamber you saw through the window is also right below you, and it houses a very important but optional Yaoguai Chief. Defeating him will be the key to unlocking the purple seals you've spotted all over this realm, but it's also worth pointing out that until you defeat the Yaoguai King of this area, you'll have to defeat this optional boss with the chanting curse sapping half your health at any point.\nIf you're up for the challenge, carefully drop down onto a rooftop in the pit below to avoid taking fall damage, then jump onto rocky rubble below to face this foe.\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Captain Lotus-Vision\nOne of four Captains of the Pagoda Realm, Captain Lotus-Vision is responsible for sealing many of the prison cells, and must be defeated before you can unlock them. He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\nYou'll find find Captain Lotus-Vision in front of a large group of kneeling corpses, which he can randomly imbue with magic to create a Withered Corpse that will come to life and attack you. These are nothing more than a distraction, but should still be dealt with immediately so they don't hamstring you later.\nLuckily, he'll get rid of all the corpses later in the fight, and they won't respawn for future attempts.\nMuch of this boss's power comes from a purple crystal mounted on the tip of a staff he carries against his shoulder, which will expend a variety of projectile attacks. Some will be easier to anticipate than others, but you'll always want to keep that crystal in view.\nEarly on, basic attacks will include a large circle of projectiles that expel from the crystal before arcing toward you. Other times, it will expel a trio of projectiles in three short bursts before they track you down in waves.\nFor each of these attacks, be ready with your Staff-Spin counter, and consider investing in skills to keep this move going and to attack out of it once you've deflected all the projectiles heading your way. A lot of this fight will come down to finding the right opportunities to strike after surviving his attacks, and you'll need all the boosts you can get.\nOther times, he may trigger a bunch of explosions on the floor, which only give you a moment's notice to dodge them, so stay mobile and roll around for a better chance of not getting hit.\nThings will get more difficult any time you see the crystal on his staff flare brighter. These brief flashes indicate a laser beam blast that you'll only have a moment to dodge or take considerable damage, and you'll have to deal with even more as time goes on. Early on, watch for a laser to shoot out as he creates projectiles rings before you start spinning your staff.\nOnce you take out around a third of his health, he'll teleport back near his original position, and shatter the remaining corpses as he draws power, creating a large and intricate circle of runic power behind him.\nThings will get extremely dangerous and annoying at this point, as he'll not only unleash a constant beam from his crystal, but the ring behind him will form smaller rings to blast you from four different locations. This will result in dodging on top of dodging as you have to escape the constant laser, and also four different blasts, and a final blast from all four circles at once.\nBecause of the difficulty of this section (and that you may also be at half health from the chanting curse), we highly recommend using Cloud Step so at your decoy can draw fire for a large portion of this attack.\nAfter the four circles all emit their laser blasts, they'll float away from Captain Lotus-Vision to take up spots in each corner of the room. Each circle will emit a continuous laser that borders the room, and will slowly pan them around to cross over the floor and each other.\nDodging them will be extremely difficult, so instead swap to your Pillar Stance and extend off the floor (preferably in range of the Captain) and start charging up as you evade the floor lasers. Once they perform a second sweep, launch your attack the captain.\nIn this second phase, the rings in each corner will stay largely dormant, but can still activate with a flash to shoot a laser at you, which you'll need to dodge alongside the laser from his crystal. Luckily they seem to all shoot at once, so you only need to keep one ring in view when continuing the fight.\nIn addition to his usual attacks, he'll also start teleporting more aggressively, sending out a new laser beam as he appears at his new location up to three times -- ending with an extended laser beam for several seconds. Several smaller projectiles can also be expelled into the air as he teleports, which will slowly trail after you to deal minor damage if they catch up.\nHe can also start detonating a trail of explosions that follow you along the ground, but have a bigger indicator than the randomly placed explosions so you can outpace them by sprinting around and dodging.\nOne of the more confusing attacks can happen when he floats up higher into the air, prompting the rings in each corner to send beams straight up in the air. beams will then start appearing at random angles in the ceiling to strike the floor in more and more locations, limiting your movement. Stay mobile and look for spots to safely stand as lasers fire off around you - and if you're still in range, hit the Captain with the Pillar Stance smash.\nKeep building up your Focus with light combos by chasing him down and using Immobilize to keep him from teleporting away, and use any lulls in his projectile attacks to rack up damage, and then unleash a charged pillar or thrust attack before he can escape.\nWhen Captain Lotus-Vision finally falls, you'll gain the **Frostsprout Twig Curio** , and **The Spirit of Captain Lotus-Vision** , which surprisingly cannot be cultivated like other Spirits.\nCaptain Lotus-Vision\nMore importantly, the purple seals on many of the cell doors are now gone in the Pagoda Realm, allowing you to kick them down and access a few secrets. There's some we haven't encountered in the Upper Pagoda, but be sure to go back and check these cells:\n* Level 1 - Right next to where you entered the realm, you can open the door to speak face to face with the Prisoner. He mentions Lotus-Vision was one of his four Captains, and that Yellowbrow tricked him and imprisoned him here, taking control of his Captains in the process. He'll request that you kill them all to ease their suffering. You can also pull the sword out of the dead two-headed Rat Captain and gain the Ashen Slumber Transformation Spell, letting you turn into a Rat Captain yourself and inflict fire, building up focus to transfer back to your main form.\n* Level 1 - On the path from the first locked cell to the Lower Pagoda Shrine, another locked cell holds a Bandit Chief (like the one you encountered in the Forest of Wolves) that guards a **Treasure Chest** of materials.\n* Level 2 - Technically the door is back on level 1, but to reach it you'll need to climb the stairs to level 2 and left to find a pit leading back down to the first floor. Here you'll find a cell you can now open, and inside is a Red-Haired Yaksha guarding a **Treasure Chest** with a Mind Core and materials.\n* Level 2 - On the path to the right after climbing the stairs, look for the first cell door on the right guarded by a Cyan Bat. Inside is an Abomination in the corner, as well as an empowered Enslaved Yaksha you can defeat to gain the Enslaved Yaksha Spirit. Defeat them both and help yourself to a **Treasure Chest** in the corner full of materials.",

Inside is an Abomination in the corner, as well as an empowered Enslaved Yaksha you can defeat to gain the Enslaved Yaksha Spirit. Defeat them both and help yourself to a **Treasure Chest** in the corner full of materials.",
