He doesn’t actually want you to get some for him, and will set off himself.\nFast travel from a Shrine over to the **Crouching Tiger Temple Entrance** , and start to head up the stairs, and then **turn right before the top** — opposite where the Meditation Spot is. You’ll find the Boar **resting against a far wall** under one of the giant tiger sculptures.\nSpeak to him, and he’ll complain of the poor meat quality, and instead proclaim that he would rather eat a meatless meal. He’ll ask that you **bring him a Jade Lotus** , which you may already have gathered a lot of by this point. If not, you’ll find Jade Lotus to harvest in most ponds and bodies of water, like the one right at the start of the chapter.\nWhen you give the Boar the Jade Lotus, he’ll relay some interesting information about a “**Realm of Gold** ” that he’s seeking. Apparently he spoke to one of the rats, who said “our senior brother gave me a **piece of gold**. I’ll need it here when the time’s right.” He’ll then proclaim that the time is right, and will leave the temple.\nThis “senior brother” is the First Prince of Flowing Sands — aka the giant rat Yaoguai Chief that you can fight in the **Valley of Despair** on the road from Sandgate Village to the **Crouching Tiger Temple**. If you didn’t kill the rat king, **he’ll summon the prince to fight you**. Otherwise, you can use the **Pungent Flesh Chunk** to summon and defeat him yourself.\nHe’ll drop the **Arhat Gold Piece** when defeated, which is the gold the Boar needs.",
