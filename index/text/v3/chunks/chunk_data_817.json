One can be bought from the Man-in-Stone after you've completed his questline earlier in the region and he's opened his shop. If you don't want to buy one, you can also find one in a glowing pot located in the Windrest Hamlet just past the Windrest Bridge in the Yellow Wind Formation area. Search for a large house on the left as you enter the village, and you'll find it in an alcove guarded by a Blazebone enemy.\nAfter sobering up, the Drunken Boar will then head to the Crouching Tiger Temple, and there request that you get him some tasty Jade Lotus -- which can be harvested in most pools of water.\nFinally, the Yellow-Robed Squire will return to near where you first met him, looking for a missing Gold Piece held by one of the Rat Princes. You can find this by defeating the First Prince of Flowing Sands in the Valley of Despair, and obtaning the Arhat Gold Piece from him. Return to Rockrest Flat, and the boar will fight you for the gold.",
