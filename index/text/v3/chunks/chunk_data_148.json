    "h2_content": "Unlike other Secret Areas in previous chapters, accessing the Purple Cloud Mountain is fairly straightforward, and only requires you to track down and defeat an optional boss character in both locations he's hiding in.\nThe first time you can find the Venom Daoist, he'll be hiding in the Upper Hollow of the major Webbed Hollow region. You can find it by circling the first area to the right, dropping down a hole to a slightly lower level, and fighting your way through tunnels full of hanging cocoons to reach the Pools of Shattered Jade Shrine.\nThe Venom Daoist will be hiding in a large cocoon just past the shrine in a large darkened room. You'll need to break him out of the cocoon, and then defeat this boss (attacking his back to destroy his extra hands will deal major damage and can end the fight early).\nOnce defeated, he'll vow revenge and flee, and you won't see him again until escaping the Webbed Hollow.\nAfter reaching the Temple of Yellow Flowers, head all the way through to the temple until you reach a large forked path by a tree and large boulder. To the left you'll find the Court of Illumination Shrine, but taking the right path leads up a long twisting mountain path.\nAs soon as you reach the top of the stairs, look to the left to find a sloping path back down to a large arena, where the Venom Daoist will attack again, this time with only two extra arms. You can quickly reach his second phase by breaking off his two extra arms, after which you'll have a much more difficult second phase.\nWhen the Venom Daoist is finally defeated, he'll point to a mural that will appear on a nearby wall, sending you to Purple Cloud Mountain.",
