    "h1_content": "Completing an NPC's questline in Chapter 5 of Black Myth: Wukong will unveil a secret area and hidden bosses. The Five Element Carts guard passages throughout the Flaming Mountains, but you'll need to beat four of them if you want to enter Bishui Cave. Here's everything you need to know to complete this questline, including a detailed walkthrough below.\n1. Defeat the Pale-Axe Stalwart\n2. Defeat the Brown-Iron Cart\n3. Defeat Gray-Bronze Cart\n4. Speak to Pale-Axe Stalwart Again\n5. Defeat Crimson-Silver Cart\n6. Find the Cooling Slope\n7. Defeat Rusty-Gold Cart\n8. Speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart One More Time\n### Defeat the Pale-Axe Stalwart\nFollow the path from the Ashen Pass I Keeper's Shrine (the first shrine in Chapter 5). You'll come to an area where a fight is happening and fire is being thrown down. Beat the Pale-Axe Stalwart here, and he becomes an NPC to talk to.\nExhaust all the dialogue you can with him. He'll mention some coffin carts that blocked the passes called the \"Five Elements Carts\" and ask you to destroy them. He'll also tell you that there's more to them than just guarding the passes, so you'd better check them out!\n### Defeat the Brown-Iron Cart\nAs you go up the stairway past the Pale-Axe Stalwart, you'll be quickly met with the first of the carts, which is the Brown-Iron Cart. It doesn't have great variation in attacks, so try to stick to near its arms instead of its head to avoid the continuous fire attacks. Then, just watch out for when it slams its fists down, and dodge these attacks. The Fireproof Mantle Vessel will help hugely here if you have it and for the rest of the bosses in this questline.\n### Defeat Gray-Bronze Cart\nContinue on the main path in the Chapter and past the Father of Stones mini-boss. Open the door and go past the statue, along the bridge, and into the cave.\nThe Gray-Bronze Cart health bar will appear as soon as you step onto the bridge, and you'll hear someone shout \"Help!\". You'll need to work your way down to it, however, by going through the cave.\nWhen you get to the bottom, you'll be met with a narrow pathway and the cart blocking it. When you're close to the cart, look to the left to find an alcove you can dip into to avoid the fire attacks.\nYou can expect the same moveset from each of the carts, so again, the Fireproof Mantle Vessel works wonders here. For this one, though, you won't be able to get close to the feet and stay there without being hit with the fire attacks. So, stick close during the fist slam (without the fire) and dodge this. But when it rears up, jump back into the alcove to protect yourself from any fire attacks.\n### Speak to Pale-Axe Stalwart Again\nThe Pale-Axe Stalwart will move after you defeat the Brown-Iron Cart and Gray-Bronze Cart (as long as you've exhausted his dialogue). He'll appear as a marker next to the Keeper's Shrine called Camp of Seasons, which is the shrine that was unlocked after defeating Brown-Iron Cart.\nHowever, you can find him near where you first met him. He'll just be standing near the edge of the cliff. You'll get some more information from him about the carts, and he'll encourage you to continue on.\n### The Dead Cart in Furnance Valley\nThe next place you'll go to is the Furnace Valley Entrance. When you get down to where the lava is, you can find a cart along a path to the right. **You do not need to do anything to this path to reveal the secret area in Chapter 5. This cart is related to Man Tianba's (the Horse Guai) questline.** If you want to complete this, interact with this BEFORE you fight against Keeper of the Flaming Mountains. After the Keeper of the Flaming Mountain boss fight, return to the cart and pull the string to get the Dark Thunder Transformation Spell.\n### Defeat Crimson-Silver Cart\nAfter the boss fight in The Emerald Hall, follow the path until you reach the Crimson-Silver Cart. You'll find the Pale-Axe Stalwart here fighting the cart if you've exhausted his dialogue at the previous location.\nThe Crimson-Silver Cart has a wider area that it attacks in, so not only will it shoot flames out at the bottom all around it, but it will also roll around and try to mow you down.\nAfter the fight, speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart again and exhaust his dialogue.\n### Find the Cooling Slope\nFollow the main path for the chapter up to the Field of Fire, passing by the rolling spiked ball. When you reach the end of the road, a cutscene will begin, and you'll then want to **backtrack where the spiked ball was rolling and find the place where the flames were.**\nInstead of flames, you'll now find a path down to Flint Vanguard and eventually, the Cooling Slope Keeper's Shrine. Beyond here, you can find a building, which is blocked by the final cart.\n### Defeat Rusty-Gold Cart\nThe Rusty-Cold Cart is by far the most aggressive out of the four and will combine the movesets from them all. In addition to this, it will also spin around while spewing fire and try to punch and grab you.\nUse everything you've got including Body-Cooling Powder and the Fireproof Mantle to negate the fire damage while you take it down.\n### Speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart One More Time\nOnce the Rusty-Gold Cart is beaten, speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart who lies by a rock nearby. After the conversation and the cutscene, you can then approach the frozen-over entrance and break through to head inside.",

Here you'll find a wide open space, with another of the frog bosses, called Baw-Lang Lang.\nTo travel to the secret area, you'll want to head to the center of the room. A cutscene will  and you'll be automatically transported to Bishui Cave.",
