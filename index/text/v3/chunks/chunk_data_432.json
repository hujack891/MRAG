    "h2_content": "You can first encounter the Man-in-Stone in the Fright Cliff area of Chapter 2’s Yellow Wind Ridge. You can reach it by traveling through Sandgate Village and defeating the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, and then taking the path across a rope bridge to the right from the large sealed stone door.\nHead up the path through the Fright Cliff area to the **Squall Hideout Shrine** , and then stick to the outdoor path on the right leading to a narrow crevice. You may hear someone calling out to you from down below, so head under the bridge, while watching for ambushes by a new stone enemy variant. The Poisestone is a much smaller and more agile version of the Palestone, able to dash around and expel projectiles. Defeating it will remove the stone body, but the legs will survive, and start to deploy devastating kicks if you don’t lock them down and destroy them.\nAt the end of the crevice, you’ll find an unusual looking stone. He’s actually a **Man-in-Stone** , and claims to have been trapped within the rock form. He’s betting on one of the rock guai in the large cave nearby to hold the secrets to reversing his fate, and **asks you to seek it out**.\nYou’ll find the cave in question just above the crevice on the left side of the path through the Squall Hideout region. Enter the large tunnel and keep to the left to defeat any Rock Guai you come across.\nAt the end of the cave path, you’ll find the object of the Man-in-Stone’s quest - an even larger statue embedded with shining blue crystals. Don’t get too enraptured that you miss a Poisestone along the walls trying to ambush you, though.\n### Yaoguai Chief Miniboss - Mother of Stone\nThis boss battle is an interesting one, simply because the giant crystal-embedded statue known as the Mother of Stone doesn’t actually fight you. It doesn’t really move at all, but it has a lot of health to slowly chip through.\nWhat will fight you, however, is the army of Palestones you can spot embedded in the ground and walls all around you. Make no mistake, this will be an endurance battle, as you’ll need to survive repeated encounters with more and more Palestones.\nAfter taking enough damage, the Mother of Stone will let out a roar, signaling a Palestone will quickly appear to defend her. That’s your cue to immediately break off your attack, regain your stamina, and be ready to dodge the incoming stone monster. Survival will hinge on how well you can deal with each wave while taking minimal damage, and understanding their melee and ranged attacks.\nOnce you’ve defeated two waves of single Palestones each, the third wave will consist of two Palestones at the same time. This can be a huge problem fast if they gang up on you with alternating attacks. Deflecting their ranged quartz missiles isn’t too bad… until you’re also dealing with one trying to body slam you.\nThis is the time to use everything in your arsenal to stay alive. Make sure you’re using your Spirit attacks to focus fire a target, unleash any stored Focus Points, and use Immobilize or Cloud Step to stay out of danger.\nThere’s one last wave of two after this, for a total of six Palestones for the whole fight. Again, don’t hold back, and use your Transformation Spell to power down at least one of the enemies as quickly as possible so you aren’t overwhelmed. Don’t be afraid to back well off and heal to stay out of range of their projectiles.\nOnce all six Palestones are down, there’s nothing left that the Mother of Stone can do, so keep smacking it until the boss breaks apart. You’ll be awarded the Stone Essence Key Item, as well as some Stone Spirits and Yaoguai Cores.\nReturn back to the crevice. Once you hand the Stone Essence over, the Man-in-Stone will burst out of the ground and declare you gullible for just giving it to him. That’s not very nice, and it sounds like he deserves a beatdown to get your reward.\nWhile he technically has a boss health bar and everything, The Man-in-Stone \"boss\" kind of a pushover, barely having much more health than a regular Pitstone, and only doing their regular attacks anyway. Simply Immobilize him, rack up some Focus Points, and deliver a charged strike to send him packing.\nRealizing the error of his ways, the Man-in-Stone will promptly burrow right back in the ground and plead for mercy. You’ll then be able to re-harvest the Stone Essence from him, which will turn into the **Azure Dust Transformation Spell**! Finally, the slow yet sturdy power of the Rock Guai is yours to command in battle!\nUnlike the Red Waves wolf transformation, you’ll be extremely slow, unable to dodge, and overall be a pretty big target. On the plus side, you’ll be immune to all status effects while transformed, and deal incredible damage that staggers most enemies. Instead of Might building on attack, you’ll build it while taking damage, allowing you to soak blows and unleash a powerful jump attack spell in return!\nMan-in-Stone's Quest\nAs an added bonus, if you keep hassling the Man-in-Stone, he’ll promise to prepare wares to sell the next time you visit. Be sure to take him up on this offer, as he’ll have a decent selection of (very high-priced) goods!\nMan-in-Stone's Shop\n---\nBlood of the Iron Bull - 3280 Will | Gold Ridge Beast - 12800 Will\nIron Pellet - 6480 Will |\nGoldflora Hairpin - 12800 Will |\nSobering Stone - 6480 Will |",
