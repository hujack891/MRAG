Before you reach it, you’ll hear chanting, and see the glowing eyes in a Buddha Head that lays in the sand. Interacting with the Buddha Head will give you the Buddha Eyes Key Item, but there are actually more to find dotted around the landscape.\nHere’s how to find them all:\n* Buddha’s Eyes 1\n* Buddha’s Eyes 2\n* Buddha’s Eyes 3\n* Buddha’s Eyes 4\n* Buddha’s Eyes 5\n* Buddha’s Eyes 6\n### Buddha’s Eyes 1\nAs you enter Fright Cliff from Sandgate Village, make your way up the hill toward the Squall Hideout Keeper’s Shrine. Before you reach it, you’ll go past the chanting Buddha Head on your right. Each one of the Buddha Heads has glowing yellow eyes. Interact with it to remove the Buddha’s Eyeball.\nBuddha’s Eyeball 1\n### Buddha’s Eyes 2\nFrom the Squall Hideout Keeper’s Shrine, go right. If you look immediately to the left past the wall, you’ll see a set of stairs, and in the distance, a wooden structure. This is where you’ll want to go, to find the next head.\nGo over to the other side and climb up the stairs. Take out the enemies using ranged attacks, and climb to the very top of the structure to find the Buddha Head.\nBuddha’s Eyeball 2\n### Buddha’s Eyes 3\nLook down from the top of the structure where you found the Buddha’s Eyeball 2, and you’ll see the third one waiting for you down below.\nBuddha’s Eyeball 3\n### Buddha’s Eyes 4\nIf you’re facing the third Buddha Head, you can either:\n* Go left and backtrack on yourself, then take the first right.\n* Go right and continue up the path, then take a sharp left up a set of stairs.\nBoth paths will merge, leading to an open space with a stone enemy.\nOn the other side, you’ll see a wooden structure, and a path that goes into a cave. Head in here and look for the statue on the left. Take this turning first, to find a Buddha Head at the end with a Poisestone enemy.\nBuddha’s Eyeball 4\n### Buddha’s Eyes 5\nTurn back on yourself, and take the path in the cave that goes in the opposite direction. You’ll come to a small body of water, but what you’ll probably first notice is the wooden structure and the enemies using ranged attacks on the right. Across from the body of water is a large opening, that will take you to Rockrest Flatt. But there’s actually another small path off to the left, with a set of stairs that leads up to a boss encounter with Mother of Stones.\nHead right up to the top, and look for an opening where the sunlight comes in on the right. On the left, you’ll see the large stone structure of the Mother of Stones. Go outside and you’ll see the Buddha Head in the distance.\nBuddha’s Eyeball 5\n### Buddha’s Eyes 6\nGo back down the stairs to the body of water, and take the left out to the Rockrest Flat where you’ll find another Keeper’s Shrine. From the Keeper’s Shrine, go left and you’ll see the final Buddha Head. When you have all 6, chanting will begin letting you know you have everything you need.\nBuddha’s Eyeball 6",
