    "h2_content": "As an optional battle, Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw is located very close to the start of Chapter 2 in the Yellow Wind Ridge. As soon as you arrive, you can head along the brackish pond water to its very end, where you'll find the Frog Guai in a large watery pit.\nThis is located on the opposite side of the Village Entrance Shrine when heading to Sandgate Village. From the Shrine, you can also hop down a nearby ditch and pass under a bridge to find a tunnel leading to a friendly Xu Dog Guai, who will ask for your help in defeating the Yaoguai Chief.\n### Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\nThe frog in question is the one you may have seen from the pond earlier, down in a large flooded pit nearby. While he has much in common with the other optional frog boss from Black Wind Mountain, he’s got a few new attacks you’ll need to prepare for.\nThis particular boss is infused with the power of lightning, and like the Rat Governor you faced, he’ll try to shock you repeatedly until you suffer from a debuff that increases all your damage taken. Luckily, the Shrine’s shop sells a few Shock-Quelling Powder if you find yourself struggling to survive from these attacks.\nAside from the familiar hand slaps and ground pound he can perform in quick succession, many of his other attacks now have lightning effects, including his sweeping tongue-lash attack. You can dodge this tongue lash by dashing to the side with Cloud Step, and hit from the side for extra damage. Sometimes the tongue lash will shoot out in a straight line, so always dodge the tongue to the sides instead of backward.\nBe sure not to attack too much from the frog’s rear, as its quick hop mule kick can deal a ton of damage with little warning. If you see his arms cross, he’ll bloat his chest out for a frontal assault.\nSeveral of its new electric attacks can deal a flurry of damage if you aren’t prepared to deal with them. The usual tell will be when the frog’s throat swells with electric energy. He will then shoot out dozens of electrified tadpoles — sometimes in a large frontal arc around him, and sometimes he’ll just spew them out and have them scatter around him.\nThese can be incredibly hard to dodge accurately, and is a good case for using the Pillar Stance to gain height off the floor and out of reach of the electric tadpoles.\nIf instead the frog lets loose a giant croak and raises its body up, it will summon a lightning storm that will rain down around the arena. Look for the signs of an imminent strike to dodge around them as they crash down.\nIf you’re having trouble dealing with his many lightning attacks, remember to use Immobilize whenever you see him charge up to interrupt the attack entirely, limiting how much he can actually try to electrify you.\nOnce you defeat this frog boss, he’ll drop the Evil Repelling Medicament formula. Return it to the Xu dog back outside the pit. Not only will he reward you with 2 Evil Repelling Medicament for your trouble, but you’ll also unlock the ability to create all sorts of consumables yourself at any Shrine. With all the materials you’ve been harvesting, you can stock up on defensive, offensive, and status reducing consumables.\nLang-Li-Guhh-Baw",
