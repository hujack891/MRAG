    "h2_content": "When this final match begins, you'll still be stuck in the Macaque Chief form, but only for a short duration (and won't return to this form if you die and respawn) so you might as well unleash as many attacks as possible while you can.\nYellowbrow has a lot of his same moves from your last fight, but several new ones that are even more devious and annoying to deal with.\nThe one you'll likely encounter fairly early on is his new ability to cast himself in a gold-plated protection form.\nIn this form, your attacks will simply bounce off like the Tiger Vanguard's Stone Form, but he won't readily revert back, and continue to attack in this impervious form.\nInstead, you'll want to find openings to hit him back with a heavy attack. If you have any Focus Points stored up, you can briefly stagger him, but even without any focus points its a better alternative than getting knocked back trying to use a light attack. You can also try ingesting consumables that raise your focus for an easier time breaking his gold form.\nAfter 2-3 heavy hits (or a single heavy strike with 3 focus points), his golden protection will shatter, and leave Yellowbrow stunned for an extended period of time.\nUse this period to unleash your best Spirit Attack (Non-Pure's extended combo can be huge here as he's unable to attack back) and hit him with your biggest stikes while he's unable to move.\nWhen he regains his composure, he'll strike back with more lightning attacks than ever, and once again you'll need to be extremely careful about not retaining the Shocked status, or you'll often die from a single stray blow.\nOne of his hardest hitting new attacks will start with him holding his mace up and imbuing it with light, causing a huge light to shine out from its end as he holds it back over his head.\nYou'll need to avoid this overhead strike at all costs by rapidly strafing and dodging around him, as the vertical slam will cause that giant bolt of lightning to cleave the ground, creating a permanent electric scar in the ground (and will almost certainly cleave more than half your health on hit, or instantly kill you if you're taking double damage from a Shocked state).\nThe scar will persist and continue to deal lightning damage if you walk too close to it, and as you learn this attack, you may want to try baiting him into slamming down in a corner to cover the least amount of ground.\nAmong his more familiar attacks, he can also detonate his mace after slamming into the ground after a short delay, so be ready if you notice the mace continue to glow (if it doesn't, you'll be a bit safer to engage near his weapon).\nOther times, these detonations can trigger a series of lightning bolts to explode outward around him, both spreading in a line from his strikes and also seeking you out.\nThis second fight is spaced into three phases, during which Yellowbrow will stop the fight momentarily to string you about like a rag doll. This means you can only take a third of his health bar off before he'll stop taking damage and stun you, which is worth noting so that you don't try and unleash a huge stored up attack when he's about to start a new phase.\nEven worse, when you take off the first third of his health, he'll stun you with electricity and then smack you around with his mace. This unavoidable cutscene actually takes off around 40% of your health, and is what we like to call a dick move.\nHe'll usually begin the next phase of the fight be performing another of his electrical cleaving attacks to tear another part of the ground, and with your low health, you'll need to quickly heal up or evade or risk an instant death!\nIn his second phase, he'll often throw in more attacks into the mix, including a deadly binding spell that creates a ring of electricity around you. You'll be unable to escape this ring, and he will start tossing projectiles at you that you'll need to spin your staff to get rid of.\nLuckily, he'll usually stand around gloating after this, giving you time to heal up and ingest more consumables to buff up until the ring dissipates (You can also use Wind Tamer to immediately dispel the ring if you don't feel like waiting).\nOther times, he can now raise his mace up to trigger a lightning storm all around the arena. These strikes will both track your position and also appear all over the arena, making it tough to evade them all unless you can stagger him out of it.\nIf he starts to channel energy within himself, watch for light to shine out of his body and electrical threads appear all around. You'll need to quickly sprint away as the very air around him will raise your shock meter, and after a few moments, he'll explode and deal a lethal amount of damage in a very large radius.\nWhen you finally reach the last third of Yellowbrow's health, he'll again toss you into the air, and this time the Apramana Bat will catch you and fling you around. You'll actually gain the Apramana Bat Spirit during this sequence, and fly right at him only to be knocked to the ground - again taking off a chunk of your health in an unavoidable scene.\nIn this final phase, Yellowbrow is more likely than ever to summon his giant lighting blast again as he creates motes of lightning all around him, meaning you'll need to race to the far corner or use something like the Wind Tamer to snap him out of it.\nHe can also more frequently employ lots of very deadly moves, like repeatedly swinging his electrified mace around him in multiple arcs with large electric waves of force that have an additional delayed detonation.\nYou'll need to  things very smart and cautious now, and don't be afraid to pause and use additional consumables, including rare ones given by the Xu Dog in the Zodiac Village. This match is a true endurance test, and you'll want to use everything in your arsenal to keep Yellowbrow on the defensive.\nIf you've run out of juice from your gourd, consider consuming medicine to increase your max health, or swap to a Transformation Spell to survive attacks you may not otherwise live through.\nWith enough patience and practice, and dodging his particularly deadly attacks, you'll at last cut Yellowbrow down to size. He'll try to flee the temple back onto the frozen lake at Mirrormere, only to be swallowed up by the Sage's Relic under the lake.\nYellowbrow",
