Below you'll find a guide for the Pagoda Realm Region, including how to escape the jail, unlock the purple seals, and defeat the Captains.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Lower Pagoda (Level 1)**\n* **Lower Pagoda (Level 2)**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Captain Lotus-Vision\n* **Upper Pagoda (Level 3)**\n* **Upper Pagoda (Level 4**\n* **Mani Wheel**\n* Yaoguai King - Captain Wise-Voice\n* **Outside the Wheel**\n* **Snow-Veiled Trail**\n* **Warding Temple**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\nAfter winning the battle against Kang-Jin Loong, you'll be swept up and thrown into a jail of sorts, in a new region known as The Pagoda Realm. Thankfully you'll be able to open your cell door without much trouble, but it will be long climb to get out of here.\nStepping out into this eerie dungeon, you'll find that this part of the Pagoda Realm is a prison made up of several circular tiers that comprise both an inner walkway ring, and an outer ring for cells, hallways, and stairs -- all circling a large pagoda (and that's not even the titular one) made to look like a mani wheel (or prayer wheel), as its slowly revolving and featuring large statues on every side.\nAs you begin to step out onto the inner walkway, a voice will call out from the next cell, which has a mysterious purple seal you can't break. You can still speak to the person inside, sitting against a wall next to a dead Rat Captain.\nThey'll warn you against trying to make your own way, but you can't exactly do nothing. Still, it pays to heed their warning -- this place is not going to be easy to traverse, especially with minds \"ebbing away with the tides of chants\".\nBe extra wary when exploring this area, as there are many Cyan Bats hiding up on ceilings. They'll divebomb you with little warning, and explode with ice to harass you as you deal with other threats.\nPast the first Cyan Bat, be sure to check the first open cell on the left to find a Wisp to absorb, and a Snake-Head Mushroom to harvest.\n# The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm\nIt's around this point that you'll likely get your first taste of the \"beguiling chants\" the prisoner mentioned, and there's a lot going on you'll have to make sense of. A large terrifying sound will echo throughout the realm, the pagoda itself will spin even faster, everyone will start glowing, strange new creatures will appear -- and your health will start lowering!\nLet's break it down: The Pagoda Realm's chanting curse is on a global timer, meaning even if you die or go to different Shines in the realm, or even sit around resting at a shrine, the curse can still trigger and persist. **Every three minutes, the chanting will begin, and last for exactly one minute and thirty seconds before resetting.**\nDuring this time, your maximum health will be halved! However, there is a silver lining: The curse will actually slowly refill your entire health bar before starting to lower your maximum health bar (but will still account for damage you've taken if you're currently in a fight and not regenerate past that point). As an added caveat, both the Destined One and all other enemies in the Pagoda Realm will start to glow red. This not only makes enemies easier to spot, but also grants everyone a considerable damage boost -- which can be blessing or a curse depending on who you are facing.\nFinally, during this period, strange new enemies will appear along several of the inner ring walkways. These sentries have tall lantern-shaped heads, and will try to grab you and throw you into the pit if they spot you, which is an instant death!The only way to stop this beguiling chant from continuing to manifest is to defeat the boss at the top of the Pagoda, and it will take some work to get there!\nBe wary of Frozen Corpses along this walkway that can come to life and jump at you with their sword, but also of the Lantern Wardens that appear when the beguiling chant's curse begins. There are two in this area, and will slowly patrol back forth while swiveling their heads around casting spotlights on the ground. Should you step in one, you'll be stunned for a moment as they approach to attack. Dodge before they perform their sweeping head attack or you'll be knocked into the realm's pit.\nInstead, use your Immobilize spell to lock them down and try attacking from behind, and watch out for their head slamming attacks.\nIf you see them perform a hand gesture, expect them to disappear, only to reappear from a different angle to try and kick you without warning.",
    "h2_content": "The good news is the Macaque Chief doesn't have many more surprises for you since the last fight -- even less since he won't bother trying to fake begging for mercy this time around. You'll also be much stronger since the last time you met, so this fight may not even take a long.\nIf it's been awhile since you fought him last, remember that his one major attack will have him jump into the air and slam his blade into the ground, and then perform series of quick claw swipes in front of him with surprising reach, all while keeping close to the blade behind him -- meaning he can't really pivot if you dodge and attack from the sides.\nHe'll step back to grab the sword with his foot and jump onto its hilt, before preforming a quick roll along the ground to drag the sword in a whirlwind slice with a large reach to it, followed by a final downward slam, so don't press your attack too hard during this combo, or Immobilize him before the second part of his combo.\nA longer deadly combo attack he can employ comes with three quick slashes ending in a jumping upward slash. After a brief pause in the air, he'll use his foot to send the blade slamming down vertically, and then yank it back up in an arc for a final two-hand diagonal slice attack. Your Rock Solid won't always stagger him mid-combo, so it's better to wait and parry the final slice so you can retaliate faster.\nIf he begins to hold the blade in both hands, prepare for an extended attack with three alternating slices ending in an upward swing with a long delay. When he finally brings the blade down, he'll do so in a spinning multi-hit slash, followed by a final slam to emit a projectile slash.\nAs an added bonus for this fight, you can actually use the Ancient Master's circle of fire to your own advantage, as the Macaque Chief can't move through it. If you ever see him preparing for a big series of slashes or need to get away and heal simply move to the opposite side of the circle, and his attacks won't reach you.\nWhen you've depleted the Macaque Chief's health yet again, he'll retreat for a second time, but the Wise Master will ask that you hold off your pursuit. In exchange for staying put for a bit, he will impart to you the secret of his **Ring of Fire Spell**!\nMacaque Chief (Warding Temple)\nThis spell can be swapped out with Immobilize, providing a more defensive variant on temporarily neutralizing enemies. With it, you'll be able to create a small limited barrier for yourself, which can be essential when preparing for a tough fight and using consumables and heals, or removing chilling effects.\nHead around the side of the temple after the Wise Master departs, and you can find a **Treasure Chest** around the side of the temple holding some materials.\nHead up the stairs to the left and head through the hall lined with more Frozen Corpses to leave this area behind. At the top of the nearby hill, you can spot a large cymbal wedged in the rocks of a high peak overlooking a lake below. By sliding down the slope, you'll enter the new region along the **Bitter Lake**, and slide headfirst into a formidable boss fight!\nPagoda Realm Complete",
