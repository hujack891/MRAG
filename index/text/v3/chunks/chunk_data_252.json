    "h2_content": "Before you continue along the path, face the Ashen Pass III Keeper's Shrine and turn to the right. You'll see a Purple Lingzhi to harvest and another mushroom in the center of the clearing. When you pull this second one, you'll be confronted by the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai, which is an optional boss.\n### Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\nThe huge Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai will emerge as soon as you attempt to harvest the mushroom. Immediately, he'll leap up and try to hit you.\nHe uses a spiked mace to attack and generally will perform a series of combos where he'll swing the mace, or leap up in the air and smash it down.\nThough these are fairly standard attacks, in the sense that they can be dodged and evaded, the problem with them is the small red mushrooms that appear with each one.\nThese tiny red mushrooms will appear in any area that his attack lands -- including on you. If they start to grow on you, they'll reduce your movement significantly. This doesn't affect dodging, however, just walking. The biggest problem with this is that as you move around, the red mushrooms will appear on the floor around you and continue to explode, so you'll need to keep moving.\nWhen they land in areas of the clearing, they will explode into a red mist. This is poisonous, so you'll want to evade the direct blows from the mace and the fungi to avoid poison buildup. Be sure to have Antimiasma Powder equipped to help with any poison buildup during this fight.\nAt times, he will also throw his cap and it acts like a boomerang. This is his only ranged attack, and it will try to hit you from behind, so again, keep moving to avoid this.\nOnce you've beaten him, be sure to collect the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai Spirit that he leaves behind.\nNine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\nJust beyond the clearing where you'll fight the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai, you'll also find The Crag Meditation Spot. You can get this before or after the fight. Just before it, there's another Purple Lingzhi that can be harvested -- don't worry, this won't be another enemy.\nThe Crag, Ashen Pass III Meditation Spot\nReturn to the Ashen Pass III Keeper's Shrine, and continue on the path opposite it. You'll reach a portion of the path where it narrows, and there's a Searing-Fire enemy to the right. However, the bigger problem you'll have is the spiked golden ball you can see straight up ahead.\nYou're about to get quite familiar with this ball, as it will follow you along the path for a while. It will roll back and forth over a small portion of the path each time, but if it hits you just once, it's game over.\nThe aim of this section is to find little alcoves or wider sections of the path, so you can dip into them and stay out of the ball's line of fire.\n**Here are some tips for completing this section:**\n* **Look for where the enemies are along the path.** Typically, this is where the path is wider or there's a place you can stop and wait.\n* **Watch where the ball is rolling to see where it starts and ends.** This changes as you make your way along the path, so it's always worth waiting for a second and seeing the length of the path the ball covers while it's rolling before you run.\n* **Use Cloudstep.** On the longer sections, where it seems like a mad dash to try and reach the next point, use Cloudstep to cover the ground quicker.\n* **Whenever you can, back enemies into the path of the ball.** They're not immune to the attacks, so it can make light work of them saving you the hassle.\nIn the first section, go right and into the dip with the Searing-Fire. Wait until the ball rolls past, then dash forward and to the left, where a Flamling will appear.\nWhen it's safe to move on, go up and to the right, to find the next alcove with a Searing-Fire. This is the next alcove you'll want to jump in, then it'll be another dip with a Searing-Fire enemy\nAs the ball breaks through, get ready to run to the next section on the left. This one will be empty of any enemies. Continue forward, and it's another gap on the left you'll be dashing into. This time, there will be a green Wisp, and a bit further up, there's a Searing-Fire waiting for you.\nGrab the green Wisp, and let the ball deal with the Searing-Fire, as you make your way up and to the right, where you'll find a Turtle Treasure guarding a chest. Take down the Turtle Treasure and open the chest to grab Knot of Voidness, medicines, and gold.\nContinue on the path, where you'll be jumping into a gap on the left just before the flames -- a Flamling will appear as you get there. Pay close attention to this wall of flames on the right, because we'll be coming back here soon.\nThe ball will burst through now to cover another portion of the path, so dash forward and head to the left again, where you'll find a Purple Lingzhi to harvest. Ignore the Scorching Flame enemy, as the ball will take care of this.\nAs the ball breaks through even further, run with it. You want it to be as far forward as it can go before you go up and to the gap on the left. Another Searing-Flame will appear here, and then you'll find a gap very close to you on the right, with yet another Searing-Flame.\nThe gauntlet is almost over! As you continue on, there's a small gap on the left you can dart into and then it's onward toward the flames. When you approach, a cutscene will begin where you'll see the golden spiked ball go flying off the end of the cliff.\nAfter the cutscene, ignore Pingping running off, and turn back to where you came from. Remember the wall of flames? Head back there. Now that the ball is gone, it's safe to explore the area slowly and you'll find the flames have also disappeared. A path has been revealed, which is the Cooling Slope, and the next place we'll explore.",
