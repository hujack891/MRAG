Luckily there's a Shrine near your landing spot, but it can be easy to get turned around and lost in this expansive valley, so we'll break it down for you:\n* You'll start in the **Forest of Felicity** , which with your back to the slope, comprises much of the area directly in front of you that includes a winding main path through this region, and also a hidden canyon to the left.\n* A large sloping hill to the right of the Shrine leads down to the **Brook of Bliss** , where a sizable and traversable river cuts through this part of the valley, leading to a cliff with a secret cave underneath.\n* Ahead of the forest is a second lower valley to the left as the main path cuts right, leading to the **Towers of Karma** area and a large forested field.\n* Following the main path as it crosses a high road between the brook and towers leads beyond a giant guarded archway to **Longevity Road** , which has its own optional forests and fields on both sides as the central path leads on to New Thunderclap Temple.\nOf course, you're free to explore as much (or as little) of these sub-regions of the valley as you'd like, but with the amount of questlines and yaoguai chiefs to find in each spot, we'll be covering each of them.\n### The Snow Fox's Quest\nNot far from the Forest Shrine, look for a small arch along the main path, and you'll find a unique corpse sitting along the wood posts that looks different from the rest. You can interact to hear a voice -- coming not from the body, but from the fox pelt around its neck. Apparently that story about the snow fox and the human you saw after completing Chapter 2 actually happened, and the fox guai wants revenge.\nShe'll gift you the Snow Fox Brush, allowing you to take the form of the Snow Fox and seek out the human scholar who resides in New Thunderclap Temple.\nHowever, it's a long road to get there, and you can't attack in this form, so for now it's better that you De-transform, and use the key item later on when you're close to your target.\nBack at the Forest Shrine, look left from the main road to find two different passageways into a canyon. The passage before reaching the Shrine leads past a green Wisp you can absorb into a small pond where a new Frog Guai miniboss is waiting.",
