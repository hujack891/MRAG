    "h2_content": "Non-White is a peculiar foe who attacks in haphazard fashion with his large thin blade. The most important thing to note is the smaller bar above his health bar: Non-White can use his blade to repeatedly block and parry your attacks, which can at times effectively give him a second health bar. Finding the right times to strike can be useful in circumventing his defenses, but you'll want to be wary of his frost and poison attacks. Stock up on both Antimiasma and Body-Warming medicine to deal with both scenarios should they arise.\nExpect Non-White to close the distance on you rapidly, as his most common move starts with him crouching before rolling toward you, and then sliding his blade up into a jump attack for a second strike, followed by a short pause before performing a very wide swing with his frost-enchanted blade.\nWith a bit of practice you'll be able to get the rhythm down for evading this attack, but that's only half the problem. Non-White will follow this attack by slowly moving his weapon in front of him, during which time he'll be able to easily block any retaliating attack you might have. If you want to get past his defenses, try Immobilizing him first and then hitting him from the back where he can't defend himself.\nAnother of his dangerous combo moves will start with a quick shout and an upward thrust of his blade followed by a quick jab. He'll then adopt a strange pose by lifting a leg up, only to dash at you with extreme speed for a final two-hit strike that can be dodged or deflected to get him off-balance.\nIf you spot him twirl his blade up behind him, be ready for a quick dash forward as he slashes upward, and then slams down to create a trail of ice in front of him. Thankfully, unlike some of the other moves, this will lead him wide open if you dodge to his side and strike back.\nFinally, he can also simply hang back and toss two poison-coated daggers your way in a quick throw, requiring good reaction time to evade.\nNote that if you try to press your attack while he's in an idle or defensive posture, he'll eventually deflect your combo with a louder block noise, and then retaliate -- but you can beat him at his own game by deflecting after his deflection.\nIf you've got a good idea of his attack patterns, using the Smash Stance's varied combo to \"see through\" his attacks can be extremely useful to power through his slices to hit him while he's unable to defend, and the follow-up heavystrike you can unlock usually can't be blocked by him either.\nThe good news is once you've taken out half of his real health bar (not his sword's defense bar), he'll break off the attack and retreat. The bad news is you haven't seen the last of him.\nBefore giving chase, there's a very important secret he's trying to lead you away from! Head out onto the ledge past where you fought him, and you'll find a green Wisp to absorb.\nIt might not look like it, but you can actually fall down a ledge below this spot, and you can then spy a trail of ledges leading down to a fallen pillar with another green Wisp along the middle, meaning you can actually cross it!\nOnce you cross the giant pit by way of the fallen pillar, take out the Monk Supporter on the other side, and work your way up the path.

Though it cannot be upgraded, drinking from it will help keep any chill effects at bay, and also increase your maximum Stamina. As an added bonus, and it can also hold two different Soaks!\nAs you leave the tunnel, you'll spot a peculiar yet familiar site -- that same old rat who was spotted in the Forest of Wolves is lurking around here too, and quickly darts away.\nCheck where he was lingering, and you'll find a small statue head holding the **Skandha of Thought** \\- the third Skandha in as many chapters!
