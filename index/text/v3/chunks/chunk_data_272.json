    "h2_content": "Continue straight up from the Keeper's Shrine and into the clearing that's adorned by chains. Make your way into the center of the clearing, where Bajie will exclaim it's a dead end. However, you'll soon be joined by the Supreme Celestial Inspector. If you found all of the Purple Talismans in Chapter 4, then this will be a familiar face to you.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Supreme Inspector\nThe Supreme Inspector will use two types of elemental attacks in this fight, which are thunder and fire. In the first third of the fight, it will mainly use thunder attacks, so you'll want to have plenty of Shock-Quelling Powder with you and equip any gear or curios that give you extra resistance to shock. Fire will be introduced in the second portion of the fight, so you'll also want Body-Cooling Powder, and the final part will be a combination of the two elements.\nThough it might seem tempting to equip the Fireproof Mantle, we'd recommend using the Plantain Fan, which will be able to help you in the second phase of this fight.\nThe first thing to note as you start the fight is that the Supreme Inspector will use its wings like a pair of arms. It will lunge and punch at you, so you'll need to learn the timings of its wing attacks.\nSecondly, you can expect The Supreme Inspector to fly up into the air quite often, where it will continue to attack you but be unreachable. When it's up in the air, it will largely use projectiles. These are typically in groups and need to be dodged to avoid them. You can throw the Plantain Fan out when it's airborne to immediately bring it back down and leave it vulnerable to attacks.\nThe Supreme Inspector is also able to turn its wings to solid gold and deflect your attacks. You can still do damage when this happens, but it'll be minimal. Bajie will explain to you that when this happens, it's best to wait until it spreads its wings again. Still, you should try to be as aggressive as you can while you have Bajie helping you in the first part of the fight. As always, try to reserve any Gourd usage while you have Bajie, as he'll often top up your health.\nBesides the projectiles and using its wings to attack, the Supreme Inspector also uses a sword. This is where the thunder attacks come from, and they can vary significantly.\nIn the first portion of the fight, the Supreme Inspector will perform a combo of melee attacks using the sword, often followed by a grab from its feet. Alternatively, he will fly close to the ground and quickly charge toward you. You'll also see The Supreme Inspector rise up from the ground, twirl around, and send out shockwaves in multiple directions. You can move from side to side to avoid these or dodge out of the way.\nAround the halfway mark the Supreme Inspector will switch up attacks and they'll become more aggressive. The combos will become longer, but you'll see the same moveset from the first section.\nThe biggest change from here on out is that it introduces a fiery unicycle into the mix. This will make it easier for him to move around the arena, but he'll also kick it out and send this to attack you independently. When this is introduced, he'll be able to burn you.\nThe problem with this attack is there are two types of heavy attacks he'll perform here and they can be hard to avoid.\nHe'll either launch himself at you and then spin the unicycle around until he flips it up and lands down heavily where you are, or he'll start to spin around the entirety of the arena and multiple duplicates of the unicycle will appear. These will then launch into a crisscross attack to get you, and he'll follow up with a heavy attack.\nWhen his health is down to the last third, he will cover the arena with a red haze, reducing the size of the arena that you'll fight the creature in. He will also begin to use two swords instead of one. This is when you want to throw out the Plantain Fan. It will clear the red haze immediately and continuously stun him, giving you more time to whittle down his health.\nSupreme Celestial Inspector\nAfter defeating the Supreme Inspector, he'll pick you up and fly off with you. This will lead to The Destined One learning to use Wukong's Somersault Cloud. To activate it, **press Down on the D-Pad or G if using a keyboard**.\nWhen the cutscene is over, you'll be at the edge of the cliff, so hop on to Somersault Cloud to get started exploring the area.\n### Secret Chest\nWhen you've got the Somersault Cloud ability, go back to the Verdant Path Keeper's Shrine. Facing away from the area where you fought The Supreme Inspector, hop into the cloud and fly forward.\nYou'll come back to the path where you first spawn into the level. Fly up and just above the start of the path, where you'll find a curved tree.\nLand behind it and you'll find a chest.\nInside, it contains common versions of the Golden Feng-Tail Crown, Gold Suozi Armor, Dian-Cui Loong-Soaring Bracers, and Lotus Silk Cloudtreaders.\nNavigating the area to find all the bosses can be tricky, so we've suggested a route to take with the way we've listed bosses below. However, you can find these bosses at any time and tackle them in any order you wish (except for the Emeraled-Armed Mantis, which must be done last out of the main bosses). It’s also worth noting that you’ll go up against various bosses and mini-bosses that use some of the four banes, so you may want to swap your gear, curios, and spirits regularly.\nFrom the edge of the cliff, look straight down to see a pool of water. Go down and to the center of this water to fight our first optional boss, Jiao-Loong of Waves.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Jiao-Loong of Waves\nJiao-Loong of Waves has a limited moveset, so you can quickly pick up on the attack patterns. It will mainly use its tale to try and whip you, either by spinning or flipping around to catch you with it.\nAs well as this, it will lunge and swipe at you, and occasionally sidestep or leap up and pounce on you in an attempt to bite you. With all of these attacks, simply dodging or jumping back should be enough to keep you out of harm's way.\nYou can generally stay close to this boss, but just watch out for its roar that will stun you for a few seconds. To combat Jiao-Loong of Waves, you'll want to use heavy attacks. It's not so steady on its feet, so you can easily knock it over or at least temporarily stun it. This will give you longer periods of time to give it a beatdown without interruption. If you use the Plantain Fan here, it'll be constantly knocked down on the floor, giving you even more time to attack.\nWhen its health has been knocked down past the halfway mark, it will start to dive into the water where you won't be able to reach it. It will move underneath the surface to try and dive up and attack you. Look for where the water is rippling to work out where it'll emerge.\nIt will dive in and out a few times, then its huge tail will appear from the water to try and hit you. This will appear almost tentacle-like, and there can be overlap which means you're dodging more than one at once.\nThankfully, with a limited range of attacks and a fairly straightforward way to avoid them, Jiao-Loong of Waves shouldn't require too much to take it down. Don't feel the need to conserve your spells during this fight; take advantage of them to quickly take down this miniboss.\nJiao-Loong of Waves\nWith your first optional miniboss defeated, it's time to work on clearing out the rest of the Foothills. From the area where you fought Jiao-Loong of Waves, ascend and look to the left. You should be able to see another body of water here, on a higher part of the cliff.\nOn the opposite side of the water, there's a clearing, with what appears to be a big rock sitting by the edge of it. This is actually one of the Poison Chiefs in the area, so fly over to it to tackle your next miniboss.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 1\nYou only need to kill one Poison Chief to unlock the journal entry, but there are four in the area, so we’ve included information on how to find each one below.\nIf you're not using a general build, be sure to equip gear, curios, and spirits that give you Poison Resistance. Though this is another boss with a limited moveset, it can be easy to die to the Poison Chiefs if you're not careful.\nYou can expect it to throw out little orbs of poison continuously, covering the surrounding area and inflicting Poison Damage. Equip Antimiasma Powder so you can quickly use it if you get caught in one too many attacks.\nJust like stone bosses and the flint bosses from Chapter 5, most of the attacks from the Poison Chief will be charges and slams. It will try to use the weight of its body to attack while delivering smatterings of poison around the area.\nIts charges can be avoided, by dashing out of the way just before it reaches you. A similar approach can be applied to dealing with its lunges and punches.\nThe biggest issue is the poison attacks, and it's essential to interrupt them as often as you can. The Plantain Fan can prove invaluable here once again, especially if you deploy it just before a poison attack. It will push the Poison Chief back and allow you to follow up with attacks. Use Immobilize when the Plantain Fan has stopped working, to keep it in place and deplete its health as quickly as possible.\nPoison Chief 1\nWhen the Poison Chief is down, fly up and continue left toward the water. Go almost to the end of the water, where you should see a giant creature. When you get close to it, it will leap in the air and jump to a nearby rock. Fly over to it, then land on its head.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Feng-Tail General\nThe boss fight against the Feng-Tail General is more of a skill check than anything, testing out whether you've got the necessary health and stamina to continue.\nFirstly, it will test your stamina. When you approach it near the Mantis-Catching Swamp, and land on its head you'll need to approach its antennae. Interact with them and hold on. It will begin to jump around the water, eventually ending up near the Rhino Watch Slope. Your stamina bar will drain as it does this, and you'll only be able to complete the test if it doesn't completely run out before the critter stops jumping. If you're finding it hard to hold on, reset some skills and ensure that Rampant Vigor is maxed out under Survival, and see if you've missed any Celestial Nonary Pill Locations.\nThe second test will be on your health bar, and particularly test your fire resistance. When the insect stops jumping, you'll be expected to interact with its flaming antennae. Before you do this, equip your Fireproof Mantle, and ensure you've maxed out your Bane Mitigation skill. Check to see if you have any other gear you can equip that helps with burn resistance, and see if you've missed any Celestial Jade Lotus Pill Locations.\nIf you're able to hang on without dying, you'll snap the antennae from the insect and receive the Golden Feng-Tail Crown.\nFeng-Tail General\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby.",
