Not only is he pretty adept with his rake weapon, and can also belch poison at enemies, he can also expel a healing mist to help you recover your health and save on using your gourd!\nStart by heading along the shore and defeating various Frozen Corpses, and look for a small building in the distance by the water's edge. As you near it, you can also spot a dragon man standing alone in the shallows. Zhu Bajie seems to know him, but as you approach, you'll be pulled into another boss fight.",
