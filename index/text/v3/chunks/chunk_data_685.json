When it's built up, use Earthshatter Slam to replenish your health and perform a heavy attack, and keep Rock Solid for moments when you can deflect Erlang Shen's blade attack.\nWhen Erlang Shen's health reaches around 70%, he'll imbue his sword with fire, and start to use it as a whip. This will make the fight a bit tougher, but you'll replenish your health whenever you use Eartshatter Slam. Be sure to use Ice Bath to counter these fire attacks.\nAround the halfway mark, Erlang Shen will grab you and breath fire on you. Your health bar will drain all the way down, but you won't die. instead, you'll switch to Fiery Fist and be able to perform Scorch Shower instead of Icy Fists. Your health bar will slowly replenish after this, and the second part of the fight will begin.\nJust keep pummelling away at Erlang Shen and making use of all the Spells until he's defeated.\nErlang Shen",
