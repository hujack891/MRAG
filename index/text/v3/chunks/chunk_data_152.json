    "h2_content": "Though he's not the final boss of Purple Cloud Mountain, the Scorpionlord is as tough as they come, owing to the massive amount of damage he can perform with either his giant claw or venomous tail. You'll need a a lot of armor to withstand his hits, and plenty of poison defense to boot, which means using the Gall Soak, and poison-resistant curios to help you out.\nIf you recall your fights with the three Scorpion Princes in the Webbed Hollow, you may find more than a few of the Scorpionlord's attacks familiar, but don't be lulled into thinking you have him figured out: all of his moves strike faster, hit harder, and will evolve into longer combos as the fight drags on. Much of this fight will be learning his basic combos early, but being ready to adapt when he tricks you with extended attacks when you may otherwise think you have an opening.\nWhile your initial fight will start with him crouching down before launching a very long piercing tail strike, all subsequent attempts will begin with him whirling away from you, only to leap toward you fairly fast.\nJust like the Scorpion Prince, he'll slash at you with his claw while still airborne in front of you, but quickly follow up with a tailswipe to quickly spin about, letting him slam down with his claw for a third hit. As you can see, he'll be very tricky in alternating between his claw and tail, and you'll only have a second to see either appendage glow to know where his attack is coming from and react.\nOn the plus side, you can deflect his initial lunge with a Rock Solid Deflection, but be wary when using Immobilize, as he's prone to escaping faster than other bosses, so you'll need to follow with a strong hit or risk him breaking out to resume his combo attacks.\nDo note that later on in the fight, he can bait you with this attack by whirling away and starting to leap, but extending his tail far head instead to stab you!\nAnother move he often follows up his initial combo with will start when you see him roll forward on the ground. He'll start rapidly spinning to send his tail whirling along the ground with him three times in quick succession, before rising up and slashing upward with his tail as he does.\nYou may also remember the claw charge used by the Scorpion Princes, as the Scorpionlord will also drag his claw along the ground and drive forward with it. If you react quickly, you can deflect it early to stop his rampage, but later on your Rock Solid won't be enough to stop you from getting knocked back. If you don't stop it early, he'll usually charge past, pivot, and whip his tail to prevent you retaliating.\nIf you spot the boss leaping upward into the air, assume he's likely to slam down with his tail with surprising range. He can do this twice while twisting his body to the side, but later on he'll add a delayed final strike as he moves into a frontal flip.\nHowever, his most devastating attack is the one the snake woman warned you of: The Deathsting. Your only warning his when his tail stands straight up behind him and begins to glow white.\nHe'll then launch into a series of quick and relentless tail swipes, starting with an upward slash, a downward slam, followed by a quick low sweep, and then a final extremely damaging thrust from behind his back. The timing of these strikes can be challenging to time correctly, and he'll punctuate three of the four strikes as he shouts \"Taste my... deathsting!\" Due to how powerful this move is, you'll need to practice timing your dodges perfectly to avoid getting hit and poisoned by his strikes.\nOnce you've dealt a fair amount of damage, he can also drive his tail deep into the ground. Poison will start welling up in multiple spots all around you, and explode with small geysers after a moment. The area is quite large, and you may want to quickly swap to the Pillar Stance to avoid the explosions and retaliate quickly with a charged hit.\nHe can also run toward you and dive into the ground, forcing you to lose your lock on as he waits below ground for a moment before busting out to attack as he erupts forth. Don't get greedy after he appears, as he will usually follow his re-entry with a quick tail swipe that can turn into a grab if it connects, and immediately inject a large dose of poison into you while also dealing massive damage.\nYou'll also need to be ready to deal with a variety of claw swipes he can employ: Some come in two slow slashes as he staggers about, while another comes in a series of quick downward slams before he pauses for one final slam that can throw off your timing.\nIf everything mentioned already wasn't bad enough to deal with, things will only get harder the more damage you deal. Many of his attacks will gain extended combos, making it harder to predict when you'll next get a chance to get some damage in.\nExpect him to add somersault flips with tail strikes or behind his back stabs into many of his combos at the very end, or immediately reset after his deathsting attack to start a new attack. In addition, many of his sting attacks that leaves poison along the ground will also erupt with geysers after a moment, requiring you to stay well away from the path of these attacks.\nFinding openings can be difficult, especially when Immobilize doesn't last long and deflecting anything but his more standard claw hits will just send you tumbling back.\nLuckily, you can bank a powerful Spirit Attack to stagger him on cue, or bank a few focus points to knock him out of certain attacks before he can start up.\nYou may also want to invest in using Transformation Spells like Hoarfrost or Umbral Abyss to try freezing him which can slow him down and open him up to more hits.\nExpect the fight to take a lot of practice, as one wrong step can easily remove a ton of health or leave you poisoned, and you may not survive the time it takes to cure it. Once the fearsome foe is finally defeated, you'll gain a wealth of treasures, including a Stained Jade Gourd, Sky-Piercing Horn, and Deathstinger Material to complete finally complete the Insect Armor Set.\nThe Scorpionlord\nYou can also now loot the **Treasure Chest** he was guarding, though it may only contain a rare consumable like a single Loong Aura Amplification Pellet.\nExit the area through the top path, and note that you can find a slope up to a second peak, which has a few green Wisps to absorb, and a Dragonfly Guai guarding a rope bridge.\nAt the end of the rope bridge, the central peak has the final **Meditation Spot** you can interact with to gain a free Skill Point.\nThe Ledge, Purple Cloud Mountain Meditation Spot\nWith all the major points covered, return back down to the area below, where you'll find a lone Daoist guarding a small pavilion. Look for a tiny **Treasure Chest** box on the table, and you can grab a **Celestial Registry Tablet Curio**.\nNow you can return to the archway guarded by two Spear Daoists on the far left side of this area, and behind them you'll find the Shrine for the next area.",
