It's now overrun by various Daoists, which shouldn't prove too much of a problem if you take them out one at a time.\nHowever, after climbing some stairs, you'll come across a special Sword Daoist ing a flute, and does not appear hostile.

He'll ask you to seek one out and return it to him.\nWhile it may sound like he's asking you to seek out a Worm Practitioner, in reality any of the Daoists you defeat in this hamlet has a chance to drop the item he seeks. We'll clear the village out before returning to him, but you may also need to rest and respawn them if you don't find one.\nBe sure to absorb the green Wisp in the building behind him, and then check the opposite path for two Daoists in front of a small house, and guard a **Treasure Chest** with random materials. The path around the back leads to a Fungiman, as well as the other end of the hamlet, but we have another path to take.\nThere's a lengthy moat nearby leading under a bridge, but aside from several Croaky enemies and some green Wisps, you can't exit out the other side.\nNear the man who gave you the quest, there's a large stone wall with an entrance through it, but be sure and turn left as you pass through to find stairs leading up to a high ledge.

Inside, beware of Spider Puppets, making sure both are dealt with before going for the **Treasure Chest** at the far side.\nBack outside, head through the webbed trail up the sloping path first to a home with more Daoists and Puppet Spiders guarding the area, and then drop down to the lower ledge.\nOff to the left, you can find the Shrine for the peak, but first, head to the right for a lower path leading to a home with a Spear Daoist guarding another **Treasure Chest** out front, plus a green Wisp hovering over this side of the broken stone bridge.\nWarning - Do not head up to the peak and confront the final boss of this area, as you'll ruin the questline in progress!\nReturn to the Shrine, and this time head directly right through a narrow alley into a large open courtyard area.
