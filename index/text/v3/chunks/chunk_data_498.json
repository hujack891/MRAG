Below you'll find a guide for the Pagoda Realm Region, including how to escape the jail, unlock the purple seals, and defeat the Captains.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Lower Pagoda (Level 1)**\n* **Lower Pagoda (Level 2)**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Captain Lotus-Vision\n* **Upper Pagoda (Level 3)**\n* **Upper Pagoda (Level 4**\n* **Mani Wheel**\n* Yaoguai King - Captain Wise-Voice\n* **Outside the Wheel**\n* **Snow-Veiled Trail**\n* **Warding Temple**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\nAfter winning the battle against Kang-Jin Loong, you'll be swept up and thrown into a jail of sorts, in a new region known as The Pagoda Realm. Thankfully you'll be able to open your cell door without much trouble, but it will be long climb to get out of here.\nStepping out into this eerie dungeon, you'll find that this part of the Pagoda Realm is a prison made up of several circular tiers that comprise both an inner walkway ring, and an outer ring for cells, hallways, and stairs -- all circling a large pagoda (and that's not even the titular one) made to look like a mani wheel (or prayer wheel), as its slowly revolving and featuring large statues on every side.\nAs you begin to step out onto the inner walkway, a voice will call out from the next cell, which has a mysterious purple seal you can't break. You can still speak to the person inside, sitting against a wall next to a dead Rat Captain.\nThey'll warn you against trying to make your own way, but you can't exactly do nothing. Still, it pays to heed their warning -- this place is not going to be easy to traverse, especially with minds \"ebbing away with the tides of chants\".\nBe extra wary when exploring this area, as there are many Cyan Bats hiding up on ceilings. They'll divebomb you with little warning, and explode with ice to harass you as you deal with other threats.\nPast the first Cyan Bat, be sure to check the first open cell on the left to find a Wisp to absorb, and a Snake-Head Mushroom to harvest.\n# The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm\nIt's around this point that you'll likely get your first taste of the \"beguiling chants\" the prisoner mentioned, and there's a lot going on you'll have to make sense of. A large terrifying sound will echo throughout the realm, the pagoda itself will spin even faster, everyone will start glowing, strange new creatures will appear -- and your health will start lowering!\nLet's break it down: The Pagoda Realm's chanting curse is on a global timer, meaning even if you die or go to different Shines in the realm, or even sit around resting at a shrine, the curse can still trigger and persist. **Every three minutes, the chanting will begin, and last for exactly one minute and thirty seconds before resetting.**\nDuring this time, your maximum health will be halved! However, there is a silver lining: The curse will actually slowly refill your entire health bar before starting to lower your maximum health bar (but will still account for damage you've taken if you're currently in a fight and not regenerate past that point). As an added caveat, both the Destined One and all other enemies in the Pagoda Realm will start to glow red. This not only makes enemies easier to spot, but also grants everyone a considerable damage boost -- which can be blessing or a curse depending on who you are facing.\nFinally, during this period, strange new enemies will appear along several of the inner ring walkways. These sentries have tall lantern-shaped heads, and will try to grab you and throw you into the pit if they spot you, which is an instant death!The only way to stop this beguiling chant from continuing to manifest is to defeat the boss at the top of the Pagoda, and it will take some work to get there!\nBe wary of Frozen Corpses along this walkway that can come to life and jump at you with their sword, but also of the Lantern Wardens that appear when the beguiling chant's curse begins. There are two in this area, and will slowly patrol back forth while swiveling their heads around casting spotlights on the ground. Should you step in one, you'll be stunned for a moment as they approach to attack. Dodge before they perform their sweeping head attack or you'll be knocked into the realm's pit.\nInstead, use your Immobilize spell to lock them down and try attacking from behind, and watch out for their head slamming attacks.\nIf you see them perform a hand gesture, expect them to disappear, only to reappear from a different angle to try and kick you without warning.",

What you'll encounter inside seems to be a pretty one-sided fight, as the Macaque Chief you battled previously is trying in vain to get at the Wise Master you upgraded your Gourd. The Macaque seems unable to reach the man through the ring of fire that's been erected, so it'll be your job to teach this boss another lesson.",
