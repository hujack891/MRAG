    "h2_content": "The only way to be transported to this secret area in Chapter 1 is by locating and interacting with three bells found around the Black Wind Mountain region. They can be rung in any order, and ringing the third bell will automatically transport you to the Secret Area, which you can then fast travel to and from as you wish. The three bells are located in the following regions:\n* **Forest of Wolves** \\- From the Outside the Forest Shrine, you can head up the left path to a higher road leading to a rope bridge across a stream. Follow the path straight past the bridge to find an optional Yaoguai Chief named Guangzhi who drops the Red Tides Transformation Spell. At the far end of the arena, you’ll find the first bell.\n* **Bamboo Grove** \\- At the end of the Snake Trail area before reaching the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll face a Yaoguai Chief named Guangmou who can summon snakes to attack you. Once defeated, the path up to the next Shrine will be on the right, but if you head some some stairs to the left of the grove, you’ll find the second bell.\n* **Bamboo Grove** \\- Traveling through the very short region of the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll have to defeat a character boss, the Whiteclad Noble. Once he retreats, look for a path off to the left instead of heading straight into Black Wind Cave, and you’ll find a large plaza past the marsh where several Wolf Guai sit before a wolf that has been hung from a tree. Just beyond them is the final bell.",
