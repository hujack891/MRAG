Even when she returns to a \"resting\" state, she'll usually be off the ground, and will regularly pull back her head out of reach. Expect her to deal a lot of shock damage, so stock up on shock-quelling medicine or you'll be taking double damage for a lot of this fight.\nKang-Jin Loong will often begin the fight by racing right at you headfirst, so be ready to dodge to the side. If you can time things right, Immobilize can pin her in place long enough to get some hits in.\nGet your hits in on her face when she returns to float in front of you, and be ready for the boss to whip around and prepare new attacks.\nIf she starts to rapidly fly in circles, dodge back and you'll avoid a whirlwind attack that has a fairly large range outside of her actual body.\nShe can also lunge toward you while clawing the ground on both sides of her body as she passes. Each spot she hits will erupt with a bolt of lightning, so you'll need to avoid her charging body without rolling into these spots on accident, and be ready for a secondary charge from above as she does it again.\nCertain times, her slamming attacks to create lightning strikes can end with her making a quick spin to emit a blast of lightning from her mouth. She'll pivot slowly to spread the breath in front of her, but this can be avoided by gaining height using the Pillar Stance.\nIf she slams a claw into the ground without flying around, it means she'll drag that claw towards you, building up energy to send an electric shockwave in your direction, but it can be easily dodged to the side.\nHowever, this is just part one of her attack, as after a delay she will slam down with her tail for a massive attack -- but it can be deflected with Rock Solid.\nAfter her tail slam, you'll have the opportunity to retaliate and hit her tail before the boss can re-orient her body, so make the most of these moments to use Spirit Attacks while its on the ground.\nAnother wild tail slam attack will come when the boss rapidly spins in a front circle while facing you, building up momentum from several rotations to finally slam their tail down from above.\nBe wary when Kang-Jin Loong begins to roar and emit lightning all around, as they can perform an attack to summon a series of lightning strikes along the ground. They'll track your position, so keep strafing and dodging to outpace them, and don't worry about fighting while in this evasive mode.\nOther times, with a particularly loud roar, the boss will summon a giant circle of lightning strikes all around them. They only hit a few times in different spots, and usually at a fair distance from the boss, so pursuing it and keeping close is often the way to go.\nMuch of this fight is about patience and waiting for the right time to strike back, as you don't want to waste time swinging wildly when there's no hope of reaching the boss. Let them come to you, and look for the right moments with stationary claw swipes or tail slams to deflect with Rock Solid for a better chance to stagger them.\nUsing the Pillar Stance is a great bet for this fight since you'll have both increased height and range on your strikes even if your lock-on isn't on the exact right spot that might cause your Thrust Stance to miss. Hit them hard enough with a few Focus Points banked, and you can often send her staggering to the ground.\nAny time you manage to knock the dragon to the ground, quickly capitalize on the moment with Spirit Attacks and as many hits as you can unleash, using Immobilize to keep her grounded for a long as possible.\nWhen you finally deplete the bosses health, you'll send her into the icy depths below the lake.\nKang-Jin Loong",
