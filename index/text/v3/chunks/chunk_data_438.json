Cloudy Mist has a large staff that deals ice damage and creates thin laser beams of light that track you around the arena. He can also summon white balls of ice that follow and bombard you if you get caught in their path.\nMisty Cloud is the second foe that will appear. His weapon of choice is a burning log of incense that he swings around, usually in sets of three. Dodge each swing until the combo is complete before rushing in to land your own hits.",
