Defeat him, and you'll earn a **Bronze Buddha Pendant Curio**.\nYou'll also find a small turtle chest on the pavilion's table itself, and opening it will reveal the **Sweet Ice** Soak for your Gourd Drink, giving you extra chill resistance after consuming your drink.\nBefore heading down the main stairs to a fearsome looking foe, head all the way around to the far stairs, which leads to another small building where two Thunder Rhino Masters overlook the enemy below. You'll want to take them out so they can't give him support.\nAfter defeating these two mages, turn around and look at the side of the small red building to find a **Treasure Chest** with materials inside.\nNow you can head down the main stairs to encounter this new foe, a Clay Vajra. While he may look like a Yaoguai Chief, this is just a very formidable Yaoguai (that thankfully doesn't respawn).\nThe four-legged creatures can emit fire from several places -- using a large opening on its chest to emit a huge flamethrower you'll need to Immobilize to shut down or stay well away from.\nThe creatures also has little mouths on each of its kneecaps that can also emit flames, and while they don't travel as far, the monster will constantly spin around to shoot fire on all sides.\nIt will often follow up these attacks by utilizing it's spear to charge forward in a thrust attack, or slam it into the ground, pivot, and pull it out again with a wide slash while also breathing fire from its knees. If you see the monster draw in power, be ready for a torrent of a fireball that will shoot your way and cannot be deflected with a staff spin, requiring you to dodge instead.\nThe large gateway at the end of this path is guarded by three Overseeing Monks, one apart from the others, but all can be lured away independently due to their short-range senses.",
