Wait until it comes crashing down to dodge, then move along with it to keep attacking as it rights itself.\nIt can also try to perform a short distance pounce to land on top of you, which moves much quicker than its headbutt leap. If you can evade this one, it will waste time looking around to find that it missed its grab, letting you get your hits in.\nHowever, if you get locked in the grab, you’ll be tossed up in the air and land right on its bony back and horns, taking major damage as it shakes you off. Watch for both of its paws to reach out to know when to dodge this move.\nThe Earth Wolf can also perform two short lunging bite attacks in fairly quick succession, moving itself forward with each bite to try and lock onto you.\nIf you see the boss angle its head and raise its arm up, be ready for a shoulder charge dash as it slides along the ground to try and tackle you. Stick to dodging away and to the side and wait until the tackle is done to get in your counters.\nThough it can often rise up on its hind legs to slash at you with its front claws, certain times its wild swings will make it crash forward to land belly up. After a moment it will thrash around and try to damage you if close, but with an exposed unarmored part of its body, you can try freezing it in place and expending a charged attack - preferably with the Smash or Pillar Style to slam down on its ribs for extra damage.\nYou can also get an opportune strike after dodging its grab by using that moment to hit it hard with a Spirit attack from the Wandering Wight, and big enough hits can cause it to fall on its belly as well.\nWith enough damage dealt, the Earth Wolf will fall, revealing its Spirit to be claimed by you. You can look around the arena to harvest some Jade Lotus in the pond, or check the back of the houses to find other materials like Aged Ginseng.\nEarth Wolf",
