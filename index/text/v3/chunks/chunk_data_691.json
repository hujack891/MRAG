Make use of the Shrine's store to stock up on Antimiasma Powder.\nMost of The Second Sister's main attack will come from her two front razor-sharp legs, and will be where you will want to focus the bulk (but not all) of your attention. She may often begin the fight by raising up one talon high up to the side, slice down with her two front legs in quick succession, and then rise up into the air to slam down after a delay.\nAnother move she can use at close range is to raise most of her body up on her back legs, and dance down upon you with her front talons to stab the ground multiple times in quick succession. Since it's hard to evade each blow individually, consider using the Thrust Stance to retreat and strike from a distance.\nWhen she follows up her mad dance with a giant leap, roll forward to dodge under her slam, and you'll be able to pivot and unleash an attack of your own.\nShe has a particularly damaging attack where she'll extend both front legs far to the sides, and you'll be able to spot a gleam along them before she thrusts both legs together in a pincer strike. Time it right by using Rock Solid when you spot the legs gleam, and you can knock her back.\nHowever, if you don't see the legs gleam when she spreads them wide, it will be a feint attack, and she'll quickly raise a single talon high that will gleam alone, before slamming it down on your position.\nWhen she starts growling while taking a step back and shaking her body madly, that's your cue to retreat to a safe distance to avoid a spew of poison projectiles in the area in front of her.\nThe Second Sister also has a few unorthodox attacks that can be hard to spot, but easier to punish once you get the hang of them. One of these attacks will start as he twists her body away from you first, and then rapidly spins her body around while launching herself forward, and is better avoided than trying to deflect it.\nAnother move can often happen when trying to flank her or attack on other sides, as she'll simply raise her body up high, and then slam down to the ground to deal massive damage on all sides.\nFinally, she can also perform a small leap and extend her front legs forward like spears as she lands, which may cause you to try and backpedal, only for her to follow up by shooting a quick projectile at you immediately afterward, which is both hard to spot and dodge.\nHer moves can get even more unpredictable when she's low on health, often peppering in quick poison projectiles from her mouth, or somersaulting forward to slash at you. Continue to use the Thrust Stance to keep her talons at bay, and when having trouble, always look for when her front legs subtly shift their shape to become more distinct blades to know when the attack is coming.\nWith Zhu Bajie backing you up (and you can always fall back to let him heal you), The Second Sister won't be able to stand against the two of you for long. After she's been defeated, she'll make a mad dash to flee, but not before flinging something at Zhu Bajie, who shrugs it off, and then runs ahead to chase her down.\nThe Second Sister",
