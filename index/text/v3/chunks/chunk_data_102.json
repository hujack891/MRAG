    "h2_content": "Captain Lotus-Vision is one of the four captains you can find in Chapter 3, and is an optional Yaoguai Chief you can encounter in the Pagoda Realm.\nTo find him, you'll need to reach the Upper Pagoda Shrine on the third level of the prison. Just behind the shrine, there is a pit with purple light emanating below that you can drop into and find this boss.\n### Captain Lotus-Vision Miniboss Fight and Guide\nOne of four Captains of the Pagoda Realm, Captain Lotus-Vision is responsible for sealing many of the prison cells, and must be defeated before you can unlock them. He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\nYou'll find find Captain Lotus-Vision in front of a large group of kneeling corpses, which he can randomly imbue with magic to create a Withered Corpse that will come to life and attack you. These are nothing more than a distraction, but should still be dealt with immediately so they don't hamstring you later.\nLuckily, he'll get rid of all the corpses later in the fight, and they won't respawn for future attempts.\nMuch of this boss's power comes from a purple crystal mounted on the tip of a staff he carries against his shoulder, which will expend a variety of projectile attacks. Some will be easier to anticipate than others, but you'll always want to keep that crystal in view.\nEarly on, basic attacks will include a large circle of projectiles that expel from the crystal before arcing toward you. Other times, it will expel a trio of projectiles in three short bursts before they track you down in waves.\nFor each of these attacks, be ready with your Staff-Spin counter, and consider investing in skills to keep this move going and to attack out of it once you've deflected all the projectiles heading your way. A lot of this fight will come down to finding the right opportunities to strike after surviving his attacks, and you'll need all the boosts you can get.\nOther times, he may trigger a bunch of explosions on the floor, which only give you a moment's notice to dodge them, so stay mobile and roll around for a better chance of not getting hit.\nThings will get more difficult any time you see the crystal on his staff flare brighter. These brief flashes indicate a laser beam blast that you'll only have a moment to dodge or take considerable damage, and you'll have to deal with even more as time goes on. Early on, watch for a laser to shoot out as he creates projectiles rings before you start spinning your staff.\nOnce you take out around a third of his health, he'll teleport back near his original position, and shatter the remaining corpses as he draws power, creating a large and intricate circle of runic power behind him.\nThings will get extremely dangerous and annoying at this point, as he'll not only unleash a constant beam from his crystal, but the ring behind him will form smaller rings to blast you from four different locations. This will result in dodging on top of dodging as you have to escape the constant laser, and also four different blasts, and a final blast from all four circles at once.\nBecause of the difficulty of this section (and that you may also be at half health from the chanting curse), we highly recommend using Cloud Step so at your decoy can draw fire for a large portion of this attack.\nAfter the four circles all emit their laser blasts, they'll float away from Captain Lotus-Vision to take up spots in each corner of the room. Each circle will emit a continuous laser that borders the room, and will slowly pan them around to cross over the floor and each other.\nDodging them will be extremely difficult, so instead swap to your Pillar Stance and extend off the floor (preferably in range of the Captain) and start charging up as you evade the floor lasers. Once they perform a second sweep, launch your attack the captain.\nIn this second phase, the rings in each corner will stay largely dormant, but can still activate with a flash to shoot a laser at you, which you'll need to dodge alongside the laser from his crystal. Luckily they seem to all shoot at once, so you only need to keep one ring in view when continuing the fight.\nIn addition to his usual attacks, he'll also start teleporting more aggressively, sending out a new laser beam as he appears at his new location up to three times -- ending with an extended laser beam for several seconds. Several smaller projectiles can also be expelled into the air as he teleports, which will slowly trail after you to deal minor damage if they catch up.\nHe can also start detonating a trail of explosions that follow you along the ground, but have a bigger indicator than the randomly placed explosions so you can outpace them by sprinting around and dodging.\nOne of the more confusing attacks can happen when he floats up higher into the air, prompting the rings in each corner to send beams straight up in the air. beams will then start appearing at random angles in the ceiling to strike the floor in more and more locations, limiting your movement. Stay mobile and look for spots to safely stand as lasers fire off around you - and if you're still in range, hit the Captain with the Pillar Stance smash.\nKeep building up your Focus with light combos by chasing him down and using Immobilize to keep him from teleporting away, and use any lulls in his projectile attacks to rack up damage, and then unleash a charged pillar or thrust attack before he can escape.\nWhen Captain Lotus-Vision finally falls, you'll gain the **Frostsprout Twig Curio** , and **The Spirit of Captain Lotus-Vision** , which surprisingly cannot be cultivated like other Spirits.\nCaptain Lotus-Vision\nMore importantly, the purple seals on many of the cell doors are now gone in the Pagoda Realm, allowing you to kick them down and access a few secrets. There's some we haven't encountered in the Upper Pagoda, but be sure to go back and check these cells:\n* Level 1 - Right next to where you entered the realm, you can open the door to speak face to face with the Prisoner. He mentions Lotus-Vision was one of his four Captains, and that Yellowbrow tricked him and imprisoned him here, taking control of his Captains in the process. He'll request that you kill them all to ease their suffering. You can also pull the sword out of the dead two-headed Rat Captain and gain the Ashen Slumber Transformation Spell, letting you turn into a Rat Captain yourself and inflict fire, building up focus to transfer back to your main form.\n* Level 1 - On the path from the first locked cell to the Lower Pagoda Shrine, another locked cell holds a Bandit Chief (like the one you encountered in the Forest of Wolves) that guards a **Treasure Chest** of materials.\n* Level 2 - Technically the door is back on level 1, but to reach it you'll need to climb the stairs to level 2 and left to find a pit leading back down to the first floor. Here you'll find a cell you can now open, and inside is a Red-Haired Yaksha guarding a **Treasure Chest** with a Mind Core and materials.\n* Level 2 - On the path to the right after climbing the stairs, look for the first cell door on the right guarded by a Cyan Bat. Inside is an Abomination in the corner, as well as an empowered Enslaved Yaksha you can defeat to gain the Enslaved Yaksha Spirit. Defeat them both and help yourself to a **Treasure Chest** in the corner full of materials.",
