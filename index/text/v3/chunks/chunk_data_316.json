    "h2_content": "As an optional boss, the Gore-Eye Daoist is easy to miss if you enter the Yellow Wind Formation through other routes. He lies on the road behind the large stone door featured where you can fight the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince.\nHowever, in order to open the door, you will need both the Sterness of Stone from the Stone Vanguard Boss, and Keeness of Tiger from the Tiger Vanguard Boss. With both Key Items, you'll be able to interact with the Tally in front of the door and open it, and you'll find the boss after crossing a bridge down to the Windseal Gate.\n### Gore-Eye Daoist Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\nThe Gore-Eye Daoist is not like most bosses you’ve faced, what with the creepy fleshy thing on his back full of eyeballs. This boss has a specialty - and it’s creating blood. Lots of it. This blood can be pretty dangerous too, as he’ll be able to create pools of it all around the arena, and even poison you with it, so make sure you’re stocked on a few antimiasma pills.\nWhen the fight begins, he’ll begin a loud cry, punctuated by slamming his staff into the ground that will cause several pools of blood to splash down all around him. If you’re caught in the blast, expect to be instantly poisoned, so be ready to dodge away the moment his staff slams down.\nThere’s many more ways he can create more blood pools, and not all of them look the same. Sometimes he’ll dance about and ring his staff, shooting them out in all directions and ending with a shockwave of bloody force you need to dodge.\nUp close, the Gore-Eye Daoist can only employ a few staff swings that don’t hit hard, and will regularly rely on his blood spells to keep you at bay.\nOne of these blood spells is to basically turn his staff into a firehose, and he’ll spray blood in a frontal arc around him to force you to back off, creating several new pools at his feet. Depending on your positioning, you can either try to dodge behind him, or take a retreating jump and follow up with the thrust stance heavy attack outside of his range.\nHe’ll have a few more variations of expelling blood from his staff - either in a concentrated stream straight ahead, or flinging his staff to create a wave of it in front of you, so be ready for waves of blood to fly out whenever he charges up.\nIf you see him begin to lean back and shake his staff over his head, prepare for him to create several more blood projectiles to shoot out of the eyes on his back. They’ll track your position and fly in an arc towards you, so be ready to dodge or employ your staff spin to destroy the projectiles before they can poison you.\nThe most annoying part will be when he hunches over and starts to mumble. Lines of red will start appearing from the eyes on his back toward each of the blood pools he’s created, and will essentially suck the pools back in and regenerate a portion of health. Stop him the moment you see this with a well timed Immobilize, or try a Spirit with a mighty attack to stagger him out of it, otherwise the fight will just go on longer.\nTry to keep him boxed in if possible — getting his back stuck to a wall can severely limit how much blood he can expel from his eyeballs, and stop the projectiles from seeking you out. Use stunning, staggering, and heavy hits to keep him off-balance and unable to cast his spells, and he’ll fall before long.\nDefeating him will earn you his Gore-Eye Daoist Spirit to absorb, and you can also help yourself to the second Luojia Fragrant Vine in this chapter to boost your gourd yet again!\nGore-Eye Daoist",
