Still, when it does get close enough to strike, a well-timed Rock Solid deflection can send it crashing to the ground, and is useful to have for this fight. It can also use frozen winds to deal chilling attacks you should be ready for, so have warming medicine on hand or consider equipping a Curio that reduces frostbite, and consider trying the Ring of Fire to warm yourself up.\nWhen on the ground, the Apramana Bat can slam its wings down, and create a huge gust of cold air that will billow out for an extended period. Evade this by dodging and sprinting to the side so you can perform a flank attack.\nIt can also charge up its wings by twisting its body, and will launch into two or three spin attacks by waving its wings around in a vortex as it flies at you several times.\nOnce it's tired of staying on the ground, it will often spread its wings wide to create another gust of freezing wind in a huge radius as it propels itself back into the air, where it can perform a number of attacks.\nIt's most common attack in the air is spreading its wings wide before beating them together, creating a cross slash projectile down at your location that requires some quick dodging.\nIf you see its legs extend upwards (similar to the lesser variants) it's preparing to slam down its talons on you in a quick downward slam. However, deflecting with Rock Solid will send it flying backward, only to topple out of the sky and provide you a moment to sprint over and retaliate.\nIf you aren't getting enough time in, consider using Immobilize to keep him grounded, and use the Pillar Stance to extend your height as it tries to take off.\nOnce you've gotten it on the ground for an extended period to dish out damage, be mindful not to get overconfident. If you see it hunch over and turn completely gold, it will use its own rock solid deflection to make your attack bounce off.\nListen for the sound cue of your attack being deflected, and it will quickly rise up and extend a bladed wing up in the air before slamming it down on you. You can turn the tables with your own deflection (though it will send you sliding back), or dodge to the side and bash it with a Spirit Attack.\nZhu Bajie can be a big boon for this fight, as the bat will largely focus on you with its ranged flying attacks, and as it drops to the ground between attacks, the little pig guy will be right there waiting for score some free hits. Don't be afraid to fall back either and wait for him to heal you as needed, but otherwise you can bait out several of the Apramana Bats ranged attacks without having to worry too much about closing the distance until the opportunity presents itself, allowing your sidekick to chip away in the meantime.\nOnce defeated, you'll gain a journal entry, experience, and some materials for your victory, but the Apramana Bat itself will retreat, and fly off into the distance. This won't be the last you see of it...\nApramana Bat\nIn fact the Apramana Bat will appear again as you first enter the Valley of Ecstasy, flying high toward the New Thunderclap Temple.\nYou'll only see it again during the final battle with Yellowbrow in the temple.
