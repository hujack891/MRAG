    "h2_content": "While this Tiger Vanguard is indeed related to the one you’ve faced at the Crouching Tiger Temple, he doesn’t fight in quite the exact same style, despite also having a sword. Understanding the differences and similarities in their style can help you succeed in this fight, but it will take a little practice.\nThis Tiger happens to be a big fan of lunging attacks, and will almost always start the fight by leaping at you low to the ground, clawing at you with his free hand as he comes to a stop. He’ll follow this with a slash from his sword rather quickly, and let the momentum carry him along the ground in a spin to perform a quick secondary overhead slash from his low position.\nIt will take him a moment to get to his feet afterward, but you’ll want to react fast and retaliate, and possibly Immobilize him, or there’s a good chance he’ll leap away and retreat before his next attack.\nOther times, his lunging attack will be just one big leaping sword slice while low to the ground, which is easier to dodge as it has no follow up most of the time, though he will turn to this move instead of finishing some of his combo attacks to throw you off your guard.\nEvery so often, he’ll decline the lunge, and simply swing his sword up to send a projectile slash your way. The good news is it's rare and just a single slash, moving slow enough that it can be dodged reliably well.\nNote that you can use the Rock Solid deflection spell to surprise him (since it's his own spell that he passed down to the son you gained it from) but he can also use the spell as well. It’s not as obvious as when the other boss used it, as his fur will darken but he won’t turn completely to stone.\nIf you ever see him freeze up (usually in a ready stance) hold off on attacking and instead charge up for a heavy attack when he starts to move again. If you attack too early, he’ll counter your deflected attack by whirling on you with a claw swipe, followed by a leaping downward slash with a huge arc and a delay before he lands.\nHe can also employ this huge sweeping arc attack by other means, most notably when he tries to plunge his sword in the ground near you, he’ll rip it out while performing a huge spin attack.\nAnother attack he employs frequently begins when he pivots his body by spinning into an over the shoulder claw swipe, which he’ll quickly follow through by swiping back upwards, and then kick outward after a short delay. You can parry the first below with Rock Solid when you see him spin to completely throw him off of the whole combo.\nOne powerful (yet deflectable) attack he can also employ has a long wind up as he’ll drag his sword slowly along the ground, building up friction and sparks as he drags it to you before ripping the blade up. Rock Solid can stop the attack but won’t always stagger him, but it’s easier to see coming than other moves.\nAs for his more unique attacks, watch for the Tiger Vanguard to raise his hands up, as he’ll then let loose an incredibly powerful roar that will damage you, and cause rock explosions all around him. This one can be very tough to dodge considering the range and how quickly he goes into the roar, but you can stop him short by Immobilizing him and then dealing enough damage to stagger him and prevent the roar altogether.\nSince he’s not as powerful or varied as the Vanguard of the Crouching Tiger Temple, nor is he as unrelentingly powerful as the Mad Tiger below the well, he shouldn’t give you as much problems as his sons. Remember to try switching up your stances — especially to the Thrust Stance — if you want to  it safe with longer range heavy strikes out of his reach.\nUpon defeat, you’ll gain the **Tiger Tally** curio, and he’ll realize your prowess and invite you to meet his king.\nTiger Vanguard (Kingdom of Sahali)",
