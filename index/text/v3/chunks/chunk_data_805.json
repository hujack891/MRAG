    "h2_content": "There's no slow start to Chapter 5, as it begins with Zhu Bajie rushing across the first ashen pass in the Woods of Ember and straight into a fight against several Revenants.\nAs soon as you take control of The Destined One, you'll be helping Bajie tackle the zombie-like Yoaguais.\nWhen you've cleared the area, Bajie will launch into another anecdote. His monologue is soon interrupted by the bodies of the Revenants levitating and disappearing as if they're being recalled. Bajie immediately follows and tells you to catch up when you can.\nGo straight up once you regain control and through the large door. On the other side, you'll need to pass through a short tunnel to reach the **first Keeper's Shrine of the Chapter**.\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\nThe Flaming Mountain Shrine Shop\n---\nEvil Repelling Medicament (x5) - 270 Will | Body-Cooling Powder (x9) - 180 Will | |\nMind Core (x6) - 2800 Will | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Will |\nPurple Lingzhi (x10) - 90 Will | Fire Bellflower (x10) - 120 Will | Flame Ore (x5) - 180 Will | Fire Date (x3) - 360 Will\nDirectly ahead of the Keeper's Shrine, you'll see the area is ablaze and a solitary Revenant stands by the edge. There's not much to do in this area but just before the Revenant, you can find a **Purple Lingzhi** to pull from the ground. There's also a green Wisp to absorb just to the left of the field.\nOnce you've grabbed the Wisp, go in the opposite direction and past the Revenant Archer. On the other side of the underpass, you'll walk straight into another round of fighting. This time, you'll find the Revenants fighting Bull Sergeants.\nBefore you go over to them, harvest the **Fire Bellflower** by the Buddha statue on the right. Then, go straight up and into the midst of the fighting, to find the Pale-Axe Stalwart taking on nearby Revenants. Alongside the fighting, the area is also being pelted with firebombs so having the Fireproof Mantle Vessel here can help you focus more on the fighting and less on the fire attacks.\n### Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\nThe health bar for the Pale-Axe Stalwart will appear as soon as you approach the open area. There will be Revenants and Bull Soldiers fighting around you, but you can ignore these and focus solely on the Pale-Axe Stalwart for this miniboss fight.\nHe uses a huge axe, so most of his attacks are slow swings. The main approach to this fight should be to dodge the slow attacks, then immediately follow up with a combo as he takes time to recover.\nOccasionally, he will kick at you or jump up in the air, raising his axe above him. When he does the latter, he will slam it down as he lands, but even with this move, dodging is still the way to go.\nThe most beneficial thing to you here is the fire from above. He is also impacted by the fire attacks, so watch where the projectiles land and bait him into standing in the vicinity of them. This will build up his Fire Damage, weakening his health bar while you attack, and also completely stagger him at times, leaving him vulnerable to longer combos and heavier attacks.\nWhen you've knocked his health bar almost all the way down, he will kneel. To make the area safer, clear out the rest of the fighting Yaoguais, then approach the Pale-Axe Stalwart, who will now become an NPC with his own side quest for you to complete.\nPale-Axe Stalwart\nSpeak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart, who will be pleased you've not been harmed. Keep prompting him to talk so you exhaust all of his dialogue. Eventually, he'll tell you about the five element carts and ask you to destroy them.\nHe'll also hint that the coffin carts are guarding more than just the passes across the mountains, but we'll revisit that once the side quest is concluded.\nWhen his dialogue begins to repeat, resume your exploration of the area. First, go over to where there are four chests by the wall (opposite where you first entered the area). Two of the chests are already open, but there are two more to loot. Inside these, you'll find Cold Iron Leaves, Will, a Mind Core, and a Gold Tree Core.\nNow facing away from the chests, go right and up the stairs to begin your ascent of the mountain.\nAt the top of the stairs, you'll have another set of steps immediately to the left. But first, go to the treasure chests on the right. There's just one here to be looted, which will give you some gold to sell. Then, directly opposite the stairs, you can find another Fire Bellflower to be harvested.\nOnce you've collected everything, head up the next set of stairs. At the top of these steps, the health bar for the Brown-Iron Cart will appear and you can find it blocking the path to the left. However, there's also a broken set of stairs to the immediate right, which you can climb up. This will bring you to a small roof you can run along to collect a green Wisp.\nDash up the broken steps and run along the small path to get behind the cart. Drop down and you'll also be at the next Keeper's Shrine.\n### Yoaguai Chief - Brown-Iron Cart\nThe Brown-Iron Cart doesn't have much variation in attacks. If you approach it head-on, you'll want to use the Fireproof Mantle to help with its continuous fire attacks. But, you can also avoid these by sticking close to its arms. You'll just need to watch out for when it rears slightly up and slams its fists down. Thankfully, this attack can be dodged.\nIf you've taken the small path to get behind it as we suggested, and got to the Keeper's Shrine, you have the advantage. The cart can't turn around considering it's on such a small path, so you can ignore the fist-slamming attacks entirely and focus just on when it blows out fire all around it. Use the Fireproof Mantle and watch out for when it blows fire. As soon as it dies down, drop down and hit it relentlessly with combos. When it starts to get ready to unleash the fire, jump back up the little ledge to completely avoid it.\nBrown-Iron Cart\nWith the first of the five element carts down, go and activate the Camp of Seasons Keeper's Shrine. Rest here, then go back on yourself to see the Pale-Axe Stalwart again.\nInstead of finding him wherever you left him kneeling, you'll now see him by the edge of the cliff. As you come back down the stairs to the area where you fought him, you'll see a small set opposite with two Buddha statues on either side. Go up these and to the left, to find him overlooking the mountain. Talk to him and exhaust any new dialogue.",
