On the other side of it is an archer, so be prepared to dodge its attacks or use Cloudstep to get across undisturbed.\nTurn right on the other side of the bridge, and start to head through the cave. On the right side of the cave is a green Wisp, but you'll first want to deal with the Revenant Charbone that will run at you as you step into the darkness. These things will cause fire damage and when you've knocked their health bar down, they'll explore. Take it out immediately and then pick up the Wisp, avoiding the explosion.\n### Tip!\nWhen Revenant Charbones explode, it's not just you that they damage - other enemies will be affected as well. Whenever you see them, focus on attacking one and luring it closer to other enemies, to take advantage of their explosive abilities. When they're in groups, and each one has a low health bar, this can sometimes cause a chain of explosions as they knock each other out one by one.\nExit the little cave and continue on, where you'll see two more Revenant Charbones with a larger figure (a Revenant Charface) straight ahead. Clear these out first, and be careful of the fast slashing attacks from the Revenant Charface, which also continues once you've killed it.\nWhen it's safe, turn back on yourself. The Fire Bellflower that was on the left as you exited the small cave will now be on the right, and you'll see a path on the right that leads to the next section.\nAs you step through the next bit, be careful of the Lavabat. On the other side of this small cave, turn right and cross the bridge. Be ready to fight the Bull Soldier on the other side, but also watch out for the Revenant Charface tucked away on the right who will come at you.\nOnce the area is clear, open the chest that the Bull Soldier was guarding. This will give you Cold Iron Leaves and Will.\nTurn and face the opposite direction and deal with the archer on the stairs to the right first. Climb up the stairs to reach a wooden structure, where you can find the first Meditation Spot of the Chapter.\nThe Relief, Camp of Seasons Meditation Spot\nGo back down the stairs, and when you're almost at the bottom, look to the right to find another **Purple Lingzhi y** ou can harvest. Continue on, then turn right and follow the path.\nWatch out for the next Lavabat, and when you've tackled it, **don't head up the long set of stairs**. Instead, go to the left first. Take out the Revenant Archer and the Revenant that will emerge from the floor as you get close. When it's clear, head for the end of the path and turn right.\nTake out the Revenant Charface and Charbone guarding the chest, then open it to collect Fine Gold Thread and a Mind Core.\nNow return and head up the long set of stairs. Clear the area of the Revenant Charface and the Revenant Charbones on either side. When it's safe, go into the small building on the right to pick up the Mount Lingtai Seedlings Soak from the golden turtle.\nMount Lingtai Seedlings\nContinue forward, going across the bridge where another Revenant Archer waits for you on the other side. You'll also see a Lavabat hanging from a tree, and three Revenant Charbones kneeling around it. Clear this area, and harvest the **Purple Lingzhi** from underneath the tree. Then, go up the path behind it to the right.\nAt the top, a Lavabat will attack you as soon as you reach the area. On the right, you'll find another Bull Sergeant and two more Revenant Charbones.
