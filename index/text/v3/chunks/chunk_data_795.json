Once you learn his positioning for his various attacks, you'll find plenty of opportunities to get in some of your own.\nThe Venom Daoist usually starts with his most basic attack, holding both swords to his side, and then springing forward with a dual slash on your right. He'll quickly follow up by rolling over to stab at the ground, and then after a moment leap into the air to slam down on top of you.\nWith a quick dodge to the side and behind him, you can avoid his first two attacks, and then sidestep his leap and begin your counterattack -- as it takes him several moments to rise up a second time.\nIf you see him hold his sword to the side but one sword high up behind his back, it means he's going to charge at you at a very fast speed. Dodge to the side, but then be ready for a second dash to come soon after requiring you to dodge once more. Try dodging alongside his second dash or lure him into a corner, and you'll find time to hit him while he resets himself.\nWhen up close, he'll usually either perform an overhand slash followed by a leaping attack, or he'll pull back his swords to your left for two quick slashes followed by a dash attack.\nBe ready for him to leap back with two more slashes after the dash, and wait until he returns to counter -- or simply Rock Solid his dash attack to stagger him back.\nAttack his back when you can either by Immobilizing him or using Spirit Attacks for large area of effect hits, and you'll actually be able to start tearing apart his extra limbs, dealing massive damage in the process.\nWhen he starts to complain about this, be ready for more quick dashes as a retaliation strike. Still, he's not too great at adapting, since his attack with two jump slams will still cause him to expose his back when his swords are buried in the ground.\nWhen he starts getting low on health, expect him to get more desperate, throwing more sword slices into his combos.
