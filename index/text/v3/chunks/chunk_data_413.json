    "h2_content": "Compared to Lingxuzi, the last wolf boss you fought may as well have been a puppy. This Yaoguai King is a large hulking beast of a wolf that hits as hard as he is big. Luckily, for all his size, his attacks come with clear telegraphs to help you dodge and counter his moves.\nHe’ll usually start the fight with a big leaping strike, falling to the ground with one slash, and then quickly following up with a second slash from his other claw. Unfortunately, he’s a pretty evasive foe, and finding the right moments to counter attack can be tricky.\nCertain times, he’ll dodge back after his attacks, but if he pauses to lick his claws, that’s your cue to sprint in (gaining a bonus from the Pilgrim Set) and attack with a quick light combo. Sometimes he may appear to charge the air around him — which means he’s preparing for a damaging howl. That’s your cue to simply run back a few paces to stand outside his range.\nTry not to get disoriented as he strafes before many of his attacks - which can sometimes end in a strafing lunge where he swipes upward as he slides toward you.\nOnce he stops running, watch for him to raise a claw. These attacks are usually simple swipes with a big delay, so wait for the claw to descend before dodging and attacking. His two-hit attacks only come from his leaps, so as long as he’s stationary, his attacks will be easier to anticipate.\nSometimes, Lingxuzi can dive at you face first, moving his open jaws up before biting down. You need only dodge his face, meaning you can dodge right into his arms and keep attacking.\nHis most threatening attack comes when he disengages from the fight and jump to a nearby rooftop. He’ll jump around a bit, and then leap high into the air to bellyflop onto you, causing a large shockwave that you’ll need to time well and dodge or take a ton of damage.\nHe also has an uppercut grab he can sometimes employ after a dashing strike that’s hard to see coming, which can launch you into the air for a multi-hit attack that can deal a scary amount of damage. This move comes when he’s hunched over and growls, but he won’t raise his claw until it’s too late to dodge!\nOnce you’ve got him back on the ground, try utilizing your new Red Waves spell to fight a wolf with a wolf, and unleash the fiery spin attacks while still making sure to dodge his swipes. Even though you have a new separate health bar, you’ll be able to unleash more damage in this form if you don’t spend the entire time taking damage.\nRemember you can also employ the Immobilize spell to keep him penned in if he strafes too much to hit, or you can use it to shut down his damaging roar or swipes so that you can interrupt his attack and hit him with a charged strike.\nWith his slow attacks, he’ll be easier to read than Guangzhi, making this battle one of patience and getting your hits in where you can before falling back to wait for the next attack you can dodge and punish. Once the mighty Lingxuzi falls, you’ll earn the **Grey Wolf Mask** and a **Mind Core** — a unique upgrade material.\nLingxuzi",
