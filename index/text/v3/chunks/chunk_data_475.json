Unfortunately, this isn't necessarily a good thing.\nNon-White will quickly perform his own type of Cloud Step to evade you and retreat, replacing his longer frozen sword with two smaller poison blades, and will have a whole new attack set during this temporary phase. While it does mean he can no longer block you until his frost blade regenerates, you'll need to be wary of taking too much poison damage.\nAmong his new attacks, he can quickly launch into two slashes, and then crouch down and pivot to charge in a final dashing strike meant to chase you down if you try and dodge away -- but you can deflect this final move to stop him in his tracks.\nIf you don't deflect, be ready for him to turn around after the charge and launch a barrage of poison daggers in your direction that are much harder to get out of the way of if you aren't ready to start strafing.\nAnother dangerous attack that can be hard to follow will start with him moving erratically in his mist form to close the distance to you, and start with a spinning slash attack. As the momentum carries him in a circle, he'll return to face you by spewing poison in your face. Since it's a ranged attack you won't be able to deflect this one, but you can dodge to the side while sprays straight ahead.\nWhen he crouches down while crossing his blades, he'll leap over for a low jump attack with both daggers, followed by two delayed swings of his poisoned weapons, and ending with a quick uppercut attack.\nOne last move he can perform quickly when at a distance is using his vanishing act to slide along the ground and then feint up in the air to the side of you before slashing down at an angle. He'll do this twice in a row to keep your guessing at his movements, ending with a slam attack that will break the ground around him even if he misses you.\nWith so many feinting attacks and vanishing, it can be hard to get a bead on him, and unfortunately, he tends to escape from Immobilization almost instantly, so you'll need to save that for when his frozen sword regenerates, and instead focus on deflecting his wild strikes to stop him in his tracks. Since many of his attacks are low to the ground, it's not a bad idea to swap to the Pillar Stance during this phase to attack him from above, rather than continuing to rely on the Smash Stance to see through his attacks if he'll just feint away.\nThere's a good chance he'll revert back to his original weapon before the fight is done, so make sure to adapt your tactics accordingly, and use a Transformation Spell like Red Tides to keep up with his movements.\nWhen Non-White finally falls, you'll be able to claim the Non-White Spirit from him, and also make use of the **Meditation Spot** nearby to claim a free Skill Point.\nNon-White",
