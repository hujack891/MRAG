The buffs range from the familiar ones like health/stamina/mana increases much like the Celestial Pills, but also other stats like Crit Chance or resistance to certain afflictions.\nThe best part of these new passive buffs is that you have the option to reset them like your Skill Tree, which will give you back all the Mind Cores you’ve used thus far, allowing you to come back and reallocate points to suit your needs.",
