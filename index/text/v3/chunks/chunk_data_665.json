In the first third of the fight, it will mainly use thunder attacks, so you'll want to have plenty of Shock-Quelling Powder with you and equip any gear or curios that give you extra resistance to shock. Fire will be introduced in the second portion of the fight, so you'll also want Body-Cooling Powder, and the final part will be a combination of the two elements.\nThough it might seem tempting to equip the Fireproof Mantle, we'd recommend using the Plantain Fan, which will be able to help you in the second phase of this fight.\nThe first thing to note as you start the fight is that the Supreme Inspector will use its wings like a pair of arms. It will lunge and punch at you, so you'll need to learn the timings of its wing attacks.\nSecondly, you can expect The Supreme Inspector to fly up into the air quite often, where it will continue to attack you but be unreachable. When it's up in the air, it will largely use projectiles. These are typically in groups and need to be dodged to avoid them. You can throw the Plantain Fan out when it's airborne to immediately bring it back down and leave it vulnerable to attacks.\nThe Supreme Inspector is also able to turn its wings to solid gold and deflect your attacks. You can still do damage when this happens, but it'll be minimal. Bajie will explain to you that when this happens, it's best to wait until it spreads its wings again. Still, you should try to be as aggressive as you can while you have Bajie helping you in the first part of the fight. As always, try to reserve any Gourd usage while you have Bajie, as he'll often top up your health.\nBesides the projectiles and using its wings to attack, the Supreme Inspector also uses a sword. This is where the thunder attacks come from, and they can vary significantly.\nIn the first portion of the fight, the Supreme Inspector will perform a combo of melee attacks using the sword, often followed by a grab from its feet. Alternatively, he will fly close to the ground and quickly charge toward you.

This will make it easier for him to move around the arena, but he'll also kick it out and send this to attack you independently. When this is introduced, he'll be able to burn you.\nThe problem with this attack is there are two types of heavy attacks he'll perform here and they can be hard to avoid.\nHe'll either launch himself at you and then spin the unicycle around until he flips it up and lands down heavily where you are, or he'll start to spin around the entirety of the arena and multiple duplicates of the unicycle will appear.
