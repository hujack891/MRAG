Below you'll find a guide for the Pagoda Realm Region, including how to escape the jail, unlock the purple seals, and defeat the Captains.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Lower Pagoda (Level 1)**\n* **Lower Pagoda (Level 2)**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Captain Lotus-Vision\n* **Upper Pagoda (Level 3)**\n* **Upper Pagoda (Level 4**\n* **Mani Wheel**\n* Yaoguai King - Captain Wise-Voice\n* **Outside the Wheel**\n* **Snow-Veiled Trail**\n* **Warding Temple**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\nAfter winning the battle against Kang-Jin Loong, you'll be swept up and thrown into a jail of sorts, in a new region known as The Pagoda Realm. Thankfully you'll be able to open your cell door without much trouble, but it will be long climb to get out of here.\nStepping out into this eerie dungeon, you'll find that this part of the Pagoda Realm is a prison made up of several circular tiers that comprise both an inner walkway ring, and an outer ring for cells, hallways, and stairs -- all circling a large pagoda (and that's not even the titular one) made to look like a mani wheel (or prayer wheel), as its slowly revolving and featuring large statues on every side.\nAs you begin to step out onto the inner walkway, a voice will call out from the next cell, which has a mysterious purple seal you can't break. You can still speak to the person inside, sitting against a wall next to a dead Rat Captain.\nThey'll warn you against trying to make your own way, but you can't exactly do nothing. Still, it pays to heed their warning -- this place is not going to be easy to traverse, especially with minds \"ebbing away with the tides of chants\".\nBe extra wary when exploring this area, as there are many Cyan Bats hiding up on ceilings. They'll divebomb you with little warning, and explode with ice to harass you as you deal with other threats.\nPast the first Cyan Bat, be sure to check the first open cell on the left to find a Wisp to absorb, and a Snake-Head Mushroom to harvest.\n# The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm\nIt's around this point that you'll likely get your first taste of the \"beguiling chants\" the prisoner mentioned, and there's a lot going on you'll have to make sense of. A large terrifying sound will echo throughout the realm, the pagoda itself will spin even faster, everyone will start glowing, strange new creatures will appear -- and your health will start lowering!\nLet's break it down: The Pagoda Realm's chanting curse is on a global timer, meaning even if you die or go to different Shines in the realm, or even sit around resting at a shrine, the curse can still trigger and persist. **Every three minutes, the chanting will begin, and last for exactly one minute and thirty seconds before resetting.**\nDuring this time, your maximum health will be halved! However, there is a silver lining: The curse will actually slowly refill your entire health bar before starting to lower your maximum health bar (but will still account for damage you've taken if you're currently in a fight and not regenerate past that point). As an added caveat, both the Destined One and all other enemies in the Pagoda Realm will start to glow red. This not only makes enemies easier to spot, but also grants everyone a considerable damage boost -- which can be blessing or a curse depending on who you are facing.\nFinally, during this period, strange new enemies will appear along several of the inner ring walkways. These sentries have tall lantern-shaped heads, and will try to grab you and throw you into the pit if they spot you, which is an instant death!The only way to stop this beguiling chant from continuing to manifest is to defeat the boss at the top of the Pagoda, and it will take some work to get there!\nBe wary of Frozen Corpses along this walkway that can come to life and jump at you with their sword, but also of the Lantern Wardens that appear when the beguiling chant's curse begins. There are two in this area, and will slowly patrol back forth while swiveling their heads around casting spotlights on the ground. Should you step in one, you'll be stunned for a moment as they approach to attack. Dodge before they perform their sweeping head attack or you'll be knocked into the realm's pit.\nInstead, use your Immobilize spell to lock them down and try attacking from behind, and watch out for their head slamming attacks.\nIf you see them perform a hand gesture, expect them to disappear, only to reappear from a different angle to try and kick you without warning.",

Over on the left, look for a lone tree in the cave pool to find a **Luojia Fragrant Vine** to grab, and be sure to revisit the Shen Monkey to upgrade your gourd.\nOutside the Wheel Luojia Fragrant Vine\nAs you exit the cave, you'll find yourself at the bottom of a gorge with more plants to harvest as you proceed.\nAbsorb the green Wisp in a small tunnel you can pass through, and on the other side you'll see a few stone lanterns marking an area with a small gold pot. Open it, and you'll find a **Celestial Taiyi Pill** inside to boost your maximum mana.\nThe New West Celestial Taiyi Pill\nBefore continuing along the main path, break open the wooden fence behind the pill containers, and you'll find an alternate path.\nThis will lead to the bottom of a giant frozen waterfall, and guarding it is a strange type of Abomination enemy. This foe sports two tentacle-like appendages growing over his shoulder that he can use to attack with, alternating lashes with both sides before bringing them both upward.\nHe can also spin in place while using his appendages to grab a snow-covered rock out of the ground, using his momentum to slam it down on you for a startling amount of damage, requiring you to dodge quickly to avoid taking damage.\nHe can also lure you in and open his robe, revealing even more tentacles along his chest to strike you with, so attack cautiously, and don't be afraid to go all in with your spells and Spirit Attacks to keep him staggered.\nAfter defeating this abomination, you can find a **Meditation Spot** by a small tree at the base of the frozen falls, earning you a free Spark Skill Point.\nThe Bottom, Pagoda Realm Meditation Spot\nBack on the main path, be wary of Frozen Corpses that you'll find littered around this area. As the gorge path opens up, you can spy an even bigger pagoda than the one you just escape from high up above you.\nHead through this area either taking the low path to the left, or check the upper path on the right where many Frozen Corpses have gathered around a Tree Pearl you can harvest.\nThe lower left path leads to another tentacle abomination you'll have to deal with carefully to avoid his lashing an boulder slam, and then head into a tunnel on the right.\nClear out the Frozen Corpses in the small tunnel leading into another narrow gorge guarded by a Yaksha Patroller.\nJust past him, you'll find a long stone staircase to ascend and chase the golden trail of a nearby Shrine.
