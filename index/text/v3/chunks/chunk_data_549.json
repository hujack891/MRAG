Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of Yellow Wind Ridge: Sandgate Village, as well as how to defeat its many bosses that include Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, the Earth Wolf, the King of Flowing Sands and his First and Second Rat Princes.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Village Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* Yaoguai Chief - Earth Wolf\n* Yaoguai Chief - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n* **Valley of Despair**\n* Yaoguai Chief - First Prince of Flowing Sands\nIn Black Myth Wukong’s second chapter, you’ll leave behind the forests of Black Wind Mountain for the dry sands of the Yellow Wind Ridge. An energetic (yet headless) man ing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.",
    "h2_content": "As the battle concludes, the lute-ing headless man will return to continue his ballad. A large imposing stone door stands before you, and a small shining statue near it can’t be interacted with unless you possess both the Sterness of Stone and Keeness of Tiger. If you listen to the headless man’s song, he’ll offer a clue: To beat the yellow rat sage who rules this place, you’ll need to defeat his henchmen who carry the keys to this door.\nFrom here, things can get pretty varied and more open than the paths were in Chapter 1. To the right of the sealed door is a bridge leading to the Fright Valley (plus a Ginsengling you can beat up to harvest its plants). To the left lies the Valley of Despair, and beyond it the Crouching Tiger Temple.\nFor this walkthrough, we’ll wrap up the last sub-region of Sandgate before diverting to Fright Valley first, and then the Crouching Tiger Temple, but you’re free to explore where you want.\nYou’ll find a new Shrine to rest at, not far to the left of the sealed door. Just beyond the Shrine is a cave entrance, guarded by a Rat Soldier and Rat Archer supporting him on some scaffolding. Skirt around the soldier to engage the archer first.\nOn the other end of the tunnel, the path will open up into a large interior valley with the sun streaming down on the left. Stick to the right side for now, and you’ll find a large door that can’t be opened from this side.\nJust past the door, you can find a wooden structure built into the rock walls with a glowing pot just out of reach. To get to it, look for a ledge below you can drop down onto, and take the path right to climb back up. Break the glowing pot to gain your second **Awaken Wine Worm** to upgrade your Gourd’s Drink. Just remember you can only do so by traveling back to the Shen Monkey in Chapter 1.\nHeading back down, you’ll be attacked from a ledge by a zombie-like Blazebone. These creatures fling bones down at you, but can’t do much else so simply evade or spin your staff before jumping up to kill it.\nTo the right, there’s a thin crevice filled with Fire Bellflowers to harvest. The crevice leads to a fallen rock forming a bridge to another Blazebone and Licorice, and a path leading onward.\nBefore you do that, instead take a left to where the sun shines down on a large rat statue and a curved wall, as well as a large pit. The pit holds one last major boss to deal with, which can arrive in a few ways.\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - First Prince of Flowing Sands\nIf you didn’t kill the King of Flowing Sands when fighting him and his second son, he’ll have snuck over here to summon his even bigger first son to beat you into a pulp (the First Prince however, will promptly deal with the King himself). If you killed both King and Prince, you can instead toss down the Pungent Flesh Chunk to rouse the Prince out of his lair.\nAs a much bigger foe than the Second Prince, expect a lot of large slamming attacks in your direction. He’s a wild and unpredictable opponent, so be sure to use Cloud Step to get out of the way if you’re not sure what’s coming, then crash back into him from the sides.\nThe First Prince will usually start with a lunging two-hand slam attack after he stands on his hind legs that shakes up a lot of dust, but you can dodge to the side and keep attacking as he recovers.\nOther general attacks include alternating hand slams that come in 1 or 2 hit successions. He can also put his hand down to the side first, and then sweep it across the front in a slower swipe that you’ll need to dodge back from instead of moving alongside his hand.\nSome scarier attacks that the First Prince can employ will have him stand up holding his arms to the side, then stumbling forward in a large swing as he topples down on his side, which covers a large area both from the arm swipe and body slam. Be sure to dodge to the side he puts his arms up and you’ll avoid him swinging in the opposite direction.\nHe also has a surprisingly quick lunge that’s very hard to dodge if you don’t look for the subtle cue of him slowly extending one arm backward before lunging forward with a quick sliding swipe attack. If you see it early, you can also Immobilize him to interrupt before he can perform it.\nIf you try dodging around and attacking from the side, be aware that he can either use a quick tail swipe to stagger you, or swing his arm back quickly to draw you away from flanking him, so don’t get too comfortable.\nEven as big as he is with a larger health pool, he’s not as ferocious as the enraged Second Prince. Do note however there is a **secret trick in this fight** : If you lure him into doing one of his larger slam attacks while your back is to the curved wall, his strikes may cause the wall to crack - revealing a secret!\nOnce he’s been defeated, he’ll drop the **Arhat Gold Piece** Key Item. We'll need it for a sidequest elsewhere in this chapter.\nFirst Prince of Flowing Sands\n### The Loong’s Secret Tomb\nIf you got lucky, the First Prince’s attacks may have formed a giant crack in the slightly rounded wall full of little statues on the side of the boss arena, forming a hole you can slide through. If you weren’t able to trigger this, don't worry. You can crack the wall yourself, but it will require a major attack, much bigger than your little monkey frame can deal out. However, specific transformations will get the job done - like the Wandering Wight’s Spirit headbutt attack, or the Azure Dust transformation spell found elsewhere in this chapter.\nOn the other side of the crack, you’ll enter a large tomb with a chest by a mural. It holds the Loong Scale - a very important object that allows you to access several secret bosses!\nThere’s one last bit of the Valley of Despair to search before backtracking to the next region. Climb out of the pit where the boss was to cross the fallen stone, and you’ll find a crack in the wall to sidle through.\nOn the other side, you’ll encounter a very strong Swift Bat. These enemies can dash at you very fast with their powerful swings to hit hard, or hit you from a distance with waves of force. This one in particular is stronger than the rest because after defeating it, you’ll gain the Swift Bat Spirit.\nA doorway to the right leads outside, but before you exit be sure to look for a barricaded doorway across from the crack in the wall that you can knock down. The outer cave here is full of debris, and two more Swift Bats to contend with.\nBe sure to search to the very back of the room, behind a tiger statue, and you’ll find an altar with a pot you can open to reveal a **Celestial Nonary Pill** , increasing your maximum stamina!\nFinally, exit the room where the first Swift Bat was to find a canyon path down to the Crouching Tiger Temple.\nDue to the layout of this area and the progression of a few sidequests, we’ll be coming back here later, and continue by traveling back to where the Second Prince was defeated and crossing the bridge right to the **Fright Cliff**.\nSandgate Village Complete",
