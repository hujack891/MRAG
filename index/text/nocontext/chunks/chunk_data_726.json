When it reaches Mythical status, you essentially have a frog randomizer that deals elemental damage. Tongue Whip becomes an attack, where a different version of the frog bosses will appear, allowing you to inflict Lightning, Ice, Poison, or Fire. The last option is a Stone frog, that will howl and roar.",
