    "content": "The Misty Cloud, Cloudy Mist fight can be difficult since there are two foes to contend with. Thankfully, they usually take turns fighting you, so you won't be tackling both of them at once for the entire fight. As you're fighting one, the other will eventually pop up, leaving the first to disappear for a while so you can focus on the second. There will be times, however, when they will both be present, so keep your eyes peeled.",
