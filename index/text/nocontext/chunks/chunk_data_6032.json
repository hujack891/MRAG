    "content": "The first time you approach this boss fight, you'll see the depths of the depraved power the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master possesses as he absorbs the Violet Spider into his being against her will. He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).",
