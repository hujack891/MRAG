This is Chen Loong and if you fight him and then collect the tonic he wants from Xu Dog, he'll give the Ruyi Scroll. This takes you to a completely different area in the Painted Realm called Zodiac Village. This is a hub where a number of the NPCs you've met will go, and you can even **unlock the ability to upgrade armor**.",
