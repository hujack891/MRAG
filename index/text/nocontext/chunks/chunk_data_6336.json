    "content": "The Tiger's Acolyte is an incredibly strong enemy that lends you an equally strong attack when his Spirit is equipped. It only deals a single instance of damage, but the amount of damage is decent. It also allows you to close the distance between you and your foe much faster than sprinting over there yourself. The Tiger's Acolyte significantly increases your Critical Damage when equipped. To make the most of this effect, head to the skill tree and increase your chances of landing a Critical Hit.",
