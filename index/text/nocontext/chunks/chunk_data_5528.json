Ignore the middle path leading into the main cave entrance for the moment, and head toward the large open cave area to the left by following some braziers. They’ll lead toward a large ominous statue in the dark. More Palestones will try to ambush you here, and they guard another stone statue head at the foot of the larger statue’s altar. Examine it to gain another Buddha’s Eyeball.",
