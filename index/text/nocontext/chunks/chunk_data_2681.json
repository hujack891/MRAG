The Plantain Fan can prove invaluable here once again, especially if you deploy it just before a poison attack. It will push the Poison Chief back and allow you to follow up with attacks. Use Immobilize when the Plantain Fan has stopped working, to keep it in place and deplete its health as quickly as possible.",
