This can't be blocked, and the timing can be hard to dodge to the side, so you're better off dodging backward or using Cloud Step when he reaches out with his right hand. Get caught, and you'll take a ton of damage. Be warned if you try to Immobilize him mid-grab, he can often pop out of it and continue the grab animation unless you reposition yourself somewhere safe.",
