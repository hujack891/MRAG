    "content": "The Flint Chief's Spirit allows you to turn into a solid rock to avoid taking damage from enemy attacks. This is similar to the Rock Solid spell, but it doesn't stagger the enemy when timed correctly as Rock Solid does. It still deflects damage, though, which is the main drawcard of this Spirit. The equipped effect is also defensive, increasing your resistance to all Four Banes. This makes it a versatile Spirit to channel in the Webbed Hollow, the New West, and the Flaming Mountains.",
