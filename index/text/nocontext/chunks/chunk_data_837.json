Chen Loong has invited his fellow Zodiac Deities to stay here, which include the Xu Dog and Shen Monkey who you've already met. This means you now have a quick hub area to warp to as needed to trade in your Mind Cores, and upgrade your Gourds.   \nIn addition to this, Chen Loong himself will accept any seeds you may have randomly looted when harvesting plants, which will create more materials to freely harvest over time.",
