    "content": "The Father of Stone's Spirit allows you to take the form of the beast and release two loud roars that both damage and cause any enemies within range to fly backward. This is a great attack to pull out if you're getting overwhelmed by a lot of enemies and need some space to sip from your Gourd or take any Medicine. The equipped effect is also good, increasing both your Critical Hit Chance and Critical Damage. You can boost this even further in the Skill Tree.",
