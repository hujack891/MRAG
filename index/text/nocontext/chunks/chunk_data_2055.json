    "content": "While the Cyan Loong is a bit smaller than Black Loong, he is much more ferocious, and can use his lightning powers to quickly deal double damage and tear you to pieces -- especially if you choose to face him after arriving on Turtle Island. You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive. You should also have the Loongwreathe or Kang-Jin Staff, and have a good set of spells equipped that compliment your attacks -- we reccomend Immobilize and Rock Solid, but you can also try using the Ring of Fire to buff yourself up in since the arena is small.",
