These Cyan Bats like to cling to ceiling and drop down to ambush you. While they are way less durable than the Swift Bats of the Yellow Wind Ridge, they can dive at you with their spears, or send ice attack projectiles your way that will try to inflict you with frostbite. If they try to dart out of reach, use the Thrust Stance to chase them down.",
