    "content": "The Clay Vajra is quite a challenging foe to defeat. He has four legs with mouths embedded in each knee. These mouths can spew flames on demand that create a swirling vortex of fire when the Clay Vajra stomps around in a circle. The best way to combat this is to either stay far out of the flame's reach or as close as possible between two legs so the flames can't hit you. Since the Clay Vajra spins during this attack, you will have to stay on the move as well to continue avoiding the flames.",
