If you haven't stopped here to get the Shrine earlier, you'll need to take out two Spear Daoists, but also note a small pond of water with a Tiger Sheriff down inside, along with a green Wisp. Defeating him should also get you a special **Tiger Tendon Belt Curio** (if not, it may randomly drop from other Tiger Sheriffs).",
