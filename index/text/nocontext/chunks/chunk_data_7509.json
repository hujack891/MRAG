One can be bought from the Man-in-Stone after you've completed his questline earlier in the region and he's opened his shop. If you don't want to buy one, you can also find one in a glowing pot located in the Windrest Hamlet just past the Windrest Bridge in the Yellow Wind Formation area. Search for a large house on the left as you enter the village, and you'll find it in an alcove guarded by a Blazebone enemy.",
