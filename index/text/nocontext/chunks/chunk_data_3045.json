These spores can potentially replenish your health as well as deal massive damage to your foes. Since you float through the air for the majority of the attack, you can also avoid taking damage from moves that can't reach you. The equipped effect increases your Health while slightly decreasing your Stamina. Depending on your style, this might be a fair exchange.",
