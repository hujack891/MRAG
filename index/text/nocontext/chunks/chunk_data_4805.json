However, there is a silver lining: The curse will actually slowly refill your entire health bar before starting to lower your maximum health bar (but will still account for damage you've taken if you're currently in a fight and not regenerate past that point). As an added caveat, both the Destined One and all other enemies in the Pagoda Realm will start to glow red. This not only makes enemies easier to spot, but also grants everyone a considerable damage boost -- which can be blessing or a curse depending on who you are facing.",
