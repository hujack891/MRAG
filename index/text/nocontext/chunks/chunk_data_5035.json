For one, it is a double-pronged attack that deals damage both with an initial kick to the chest as well as inflicting area damage when you land. The equipped effect is also excellent and both increases Light Attack damage while reducing Sprinting Stamina cost. Even when you're not actively using the Poisestone's skill, you are still getting those two equip buffs which can make a big difference in both combat and exploration.",
