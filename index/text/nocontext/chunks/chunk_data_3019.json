In addition to blunt attacks with the staff, make sure not to step on any of the poison gas on the floor. Making contact with the gas will start to poison you and eat away at your health. When casting Immobilize, wait until the ground is clear of poison so you can really lay it on him without worrying about getting poisoned at the same time.",
