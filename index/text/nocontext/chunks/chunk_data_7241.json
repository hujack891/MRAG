Some contain enemies and will wriggle about as you approach, but it is sometimes possible to attack the cocoon fast enough to stop whatever is inside from emerging. The smaller cocoons don't have yaoguais within, but do provide Will when broken. Even better, this area is likely to give you up to three **Rice Cocoons** when breaking a random tiny cocoon, and one or more **Spine in the Sack Curios** when breaking slightly larger cocoons, so they're worth destroying as you progress!",
