    "content": "The Supreme Inspector will use two types of elemental attacks in this fight, which are thunder and fire. In the first third of the fight, it will mainly use thunder attacks, so you'll want to have plenty of Shock-Quelling Powder with you and equip any gear or curios that give you extra resistance to shock. Fire will be introduced in the second portion of the fight, so you'll also want Body-Cooling Powder, and the final part will be a combination of the two elements.",
