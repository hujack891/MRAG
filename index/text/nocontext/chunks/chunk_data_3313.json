As the staff activates, it begins to emit a red glow. Staying inside the glow will empower your attack for as long as it remains there. This ability is akin to the Ring of Fire spell but designed to enhance attack rather than healing. Having the Gore-Eye Daoist equipped also boosts your maximum Mana, allowing you to cast more spells.",
