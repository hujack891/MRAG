He’ll race around you before leaping close with a claw strike, followed with a delayed upward slash, and a second soon after, before keeping his arm raised for a moment and then punching down with two hits in quick succession, and a final delayed two-handed slam! Be sure you have enough stamina to keep up sustained dodging for this very long combo attack.",
