These will emerge as soon as you approach, and it's worth clearing them out first so you don't have to think about them while attacking the Flint Vanguard. To do this, run around the outskirts of the Flint Vanguard and bait the creatures into attacking you, then run into the middle of the rock circle to bring out the miniboss.",
