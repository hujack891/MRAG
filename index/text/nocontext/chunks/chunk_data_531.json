Once you find Awaken Wine Worms, return to him and you’ll be able to upgrade the amount healed with each use!\n  * Brew - With your equipped Drink, you can enhance it by adding a Soak to increase additional effects beyond the heal. You can try it out now by adding the Gall Gem, which will increase your poison resistance in addition to the heal from your Gourd.\n  * Store - If the Gall Gem isn’t all that enticing, be sure to check his shop, as the Shen Monkey sells **Celestial Lotus Seeds** , which can be used as an alternative Soak that continues to recover some health after the gourd’s initial heal!",
