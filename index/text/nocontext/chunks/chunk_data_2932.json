He’ll mention “Windrest” if you talk to him again, providing a clue to where you can find such an ingredient. However, you’ll also find that the Man-in-Stone sells a Sobering Stone if you don’t want to explore. Since it costs a hefty 6,480 Will, you’re better off waiting to continue his questline when we explore the Yellow Wind Formation later on.",
