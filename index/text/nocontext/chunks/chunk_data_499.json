These spear-wielding snake-men will stand up straight up before lunging at you with a bite that inflicts major damage while poisoning you, which may force you to use Anti-miasma powder to negate its effects. They can also put their spear in their teeth and dash with it held horizontally to swing it about in a combo attack.",
