    "content": "The Puppet Tick's Spirit allows you to take the form of the hunched-over beetle and summon two spider minions to attack your enemies alongside you. These spiders explode into a puff of poison, inflicting any foes who were standing a little too close. The equipped effect is very good in this case, reducing the Mana cost for A Pluck of Many. A Pluck of Many uses a good chunk of Mana, more than many other spells. If you use it a lot, this Spirit could be very useful.",
