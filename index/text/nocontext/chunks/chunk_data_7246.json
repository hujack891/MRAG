The smaller path leads to a room with a Beetle Captain guarding a Treasure Chest on a higher ledge. The captain will be tougher to beat, so be ready for his quick flitting movements and try to anticipate his charges to deflect with Rock Solid, or pin him in place with Immobilize. Defeating him will allow you to gain the Beetle Captain Spirit, while the **Treasure Chest** on the ledge holds a Gold Tree Core, Mind Core, and other random materials.",
