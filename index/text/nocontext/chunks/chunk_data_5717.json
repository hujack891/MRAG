You'll need to keep prompting the fox to talk throughout this interaction, to learn the entire story of the fox being caught in a hunter's trap and rescued by a young scholar. Despite the fox trying to thank the scholar by helping him, the scholar ended up taking the fox's life. With revenge in mind, the fox has managed to track down the scholar, who is now a monk in the New Thunderclap Temple – a place you'll conveniently be visiting soon.",
