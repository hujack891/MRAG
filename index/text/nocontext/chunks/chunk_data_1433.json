    "content": "The Centipede Guai is a huge armored centipede that has its own boss arena in the Webbed Hollow. It can be tricky to defeat as it's very fast, very strong, has some very hard-hitting attacks, and even has an army of minions on call. You can expect to see lots of belly-flop moves where the beast smashes its huge body into the ground multiple times, a roll-attack where it curls up into a ball and crashes around the arena, and a poison spray move where it spews pools of poison onto the ground.",
