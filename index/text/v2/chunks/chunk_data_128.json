    "content": "The Boshan Censer is a rare Curios item you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. While it has a specific use, the Boshan Censer's buff is rather strong, making it quite useful for those who like to  aggressive when they are out of healing. \n\nWith the Boshan Censer equipped, it grants considerable damage reduction when Gourd use is depleted. So, if you are someone who hasn't upgraded their Gourd or is running a Gourd with a low amount of uses, this can be incredibly powerful, granting you enhanced survivability for an extended period. Dodge masters and those using Cloud Step and Rock Solid can really benefit from this Curios item. \n\n\n\nCurios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or boost the effect of them. Therefore, you will want to switch to other Curios items to better fit your build as you  if needed. This can be done easily from the game's Equipment menu.",
