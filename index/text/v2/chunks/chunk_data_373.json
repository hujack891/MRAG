Head for this, and a cutscene will begin where the small Buddha from Chapter 3 will be waiting for you. He'll open the tapestry and let you into Mount Mei. \n\nWhen you're through the tapestry, head up the stairs and follow the path. About halfway up you'll need to shimmy across a ledge on the left to reach the other side, then you'll continue up to the Mei-Jian Peak Keeper's Shrine. At the top of the peak is where you'll find Erlang, The Sacred Divinity.",
