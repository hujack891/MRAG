The Keeper of the New West will bid you to plunder the small temple on the frozen lake to find the next Sense of the Great Sage. \n\nBefore you do that however, there's a couple things to check out before crossing the giant frozen lake. \n\n\n\nFirst, start by exploring the area to the right when facing the lakeshore. You'll find assorted materials to harvest here, including **Fire Bellflowers** and a **Celestial Pear** tree in the far corner. Be on the lookout for a few scattered Frozen Corpses as you explore, and a Cyan Bat or two hiding up in the trees. \n\nThough the massive frozen lake expanse is largely empty, there is one thing worth stepping onto the ice for while on the right side. Head around a section of impassible rocks when stepping onto the ice, and run around past it to find a small alcove section with a small tree along another shore on the right. \n\n\n\nThe base of this tree holds a small turtle chest on a stone table, and inside you'll find the **Stranded Loong's Whisker Soak** for your Gourd, which will increase the duration of your Immobilize spell! \n\n\n\nReturning to the Mirrormere Shrine, this time go left when facing the shore. There's a few more plants to harvest, but the bigger attraction here is a larger group of Frozen Corpses in a field leading to the shore. You'll need to rouse and defeat the entire group, and doing so will earn you an exclusive reward - the **Mani Band curio** , which can help you out when fighting frost-inflicting enemies. \n\nYou'll also find a small **Treasure Chest** nearby, and you can loot it for assorted items that may include a Mind Core and possibly Refined Iron Sand. \n\n\n\nFinally, head to the right of where all the Frozen Corpses were gathered to find a large gnarled tree hanging over the frozen water, and a **Meditation Spot** below it you can rest at for a free Skill Point Spark. \n\nThe Shade, Mirrormere Meditation Spot\n\nThat's pretty much all you can do in this area, so now you can head toward the ominous temple in the middle of the lake, only to be surprised by what appears to the lord of this land returning. They've got a back that seems to hold many surprises inside, and will share one with you - a mighty Yaoguai Queen!",
