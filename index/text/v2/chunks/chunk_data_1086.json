    "content": "This fight has two phases, so be prepared for a tough battle and think about how you manage your Gourd and Spell usage throughout. You'll want to take in medicines that include Body-Warming and Body-Cooling Powder, as well as those that strengthen your attacks such as Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets and Loong Aura Amplification Pellets. You might prefer other medicines depending on the build you're ing with, such as the Mirage or Life-Saving Pill. \n\nThe first thing to note is that the Stone Monkey, like other Stone enemies, is resistant to elemental attacks, so the best thing you can do here is have a build that focuses on high attack strength and increasing the chances of critical attacks. His resistance to these attacks should also influence the Transformation you take into the fight with you – we'd recommend Ebon Flow or Azure Dust, which can both deliver heavy blows.",
