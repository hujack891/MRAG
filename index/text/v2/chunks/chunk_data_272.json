    "content": "The Clay Vajra is quite a challenging foe to defeat. He has four legs with mouths embedded in each knee. These mouths can spew flames on demand that create a swirling vortex of fire when the Clay Vajra stomps around in a circle. The best way to combat this is to either stay far out of the flame's reach or as close as possible between two legs so the flames can't hit you. Since the Clay Vajra spins during this attack, you will have to stay on the move as well to continue avoiding the flames. \n\nIts knees are, unfortunately, not the only place the Clay Vajra can summon flames from. Flames will also rip through the creature's chest in a burst of fire. The Clay Vajra hunches over before this move, so keep an eye on it to find out when to dodge the onslaught. \n\nIn addition to its knees and belly, the Clay Vajra is also armed with a fork-like weapon that it uses to stab and swipe at you.",
