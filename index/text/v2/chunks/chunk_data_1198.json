This is really just a chance for you to test the power of Jingubang, and pick up some extra Will and Sparks. \n\n\n\nAbout halfway up, Zhu Bajie loses his patience and transforms into a boar, knocking down a number of soldiers as he dashes off. \n\n\n\nJust keep working your way up to the top of the path, taking out as many soldiers as you want along the way. You'll pass by a portion of the path covered in fire, and then enter into a cave. \n\n\n\nGo to the top of the cave, then turn left, and follow the path until you need to squeeze through a gap in the wall. \n\n\n\nWhen you emerge on the other side, you'll see the final stretch of the path that dips down and then slopes upward. Head for the top and activate the Peak of Innocence Keeper's Shrine, just before the end of the path.",
