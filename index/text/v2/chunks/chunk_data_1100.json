    "content": "The Tiger's Acolyte is a significantly powerful foe in his own right, and the battle is even further complicated by the fact that it takes place on a bridge. You can easily fall off the bridge during the fight, causing you to die immediately. That makes it much more tricky than a battle on solid ground. \n\nThe Tiger's Acolyte is very fast and very strong. Immobilize will be a big help here, as will perfect dodging. The longer you tussle on the bridge, the more chance you have of falling off. Pull out all your spells in this fight to defeat him as quickly as possible.",
