Here are the attacks you can expect to see when tussling with the Earth Wolf: \n\n  * Bite\n  * Swipe\n  * Charge \n  * Hind Leg Swipe\n  * At points throughout the battle the Earth Wolf will start glowing like it's filled with fire. \n\nThe Earth Wolf hits very hard, but winds up a lot of its moves, giving you a chance to dodge out of the way before they hit.",
