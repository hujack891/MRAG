If they start to grow on you, they'll reduce your movement significantly. This doesn't affect dodging, however, just walking. The biggest problem with this is that as you move around, the red mushrooms will appear on the floor around you and continue to explode, so you'll need to keep moving. \n\nWhen they land in areas of the clearing, they will explode into a red mist. This is poisonous, so you'll want to evade the direct blows from the mace and the fungi to avoid poison buildup. Be sure to have Antimiasma Powder equipped to help with any poison buildup during this fight. \n\nAt times, he will also throw his cap and it acts like a boomerang. This is his only ranged attack, and it will try to hit you from behind, so again, keep moving to avoid this. \n\nOnce you've beaten him, be sure to collect the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai Spirit that he leaves behind. \n\nNine-Capped Lingzhi Guai",
