Be ready to be ambushed by a few Croaky enemies after hopping down the falls or taking the nearby stairs, and continue on until the stream ends. \n\nTo the right of the water, you'll spot the assorted stone monuments that are the titular Towers of Karma, giving the place a cemetery-like quality. A path winds through these small stone pillars, and is guarded by an assortment of Frozen Corpses, Monk Supporters, and a new enemy. \n\n\n\nThis Circus Monkey will use its gong to rally the troops and alert any Frozen Corpses nearby to rise and ambush you. Luckily, he's not too strong on his own and can be taken out quickly before focusing on the others.",
