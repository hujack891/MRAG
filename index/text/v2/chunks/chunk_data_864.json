A large imposing stone door stands before you, and a small shining statue near it can’t be interacted with unless you possess both the Sterness of Stone and Keeness of Tiger. If you listen to the headless man’s song, he’ll offer a clue: To beat the yellow rat sage who rules this place, you’ll need to defeat his henchmen who carry the keys to this door. \n\nFrom here, things can get pretty varied and more open than the paths were in Chapter 1. To the right of the sealed door is a bridge leading to the Fright Valley (plus a Ginsengling you can beat up to harvest its plants). To the left lies the Valley of Despair, and beyond it the Crouching Tiger Temple. \n\n\n\nFor this walkthrough, we’ll wrap up the last sub-region of Sandgate before diverting to Fright Valley first, and then the Crouching Tiger Temple, but you’re free to explore where you want. \n\n\n\nYou’ll find a new Shrine to rest at, not far to the left of the sealed door. Just beyond the Shrine is a cave entrance, guarded by a Rat Soldier and Rat Archer supporting him on some scaffolding. Skirt around the soldier to engage the archer first. \n\n\n\nOn the other end of the tunnel, the path will open up into a large interior valley with the sun streaming down on the left. Stick to the right side for now, and you’ll find a large door that can’t be opened from this side. \n\n\n\nJust past the door, you can find a wooden structure built into the rock walls with a glowing pot just out of reach. To get to it, look for a ledge below you can drop down onto, and take the path right to climb back up. Break the glowing pot to gain your second **Awaken Wine Worm** to upgrade your Gourd’s Drink. Just remember you can only do so by traveling back to the Shen Monkey in Chapter 1. \n\n\n\nHeading back down, you’ll be attacked from a ledge by a zombie-like Blazebone. These creatures fling bones down at you, but can’t do much else so simply evade or spin your staff before jumping up to kill it. \n\n\n\nTo the right, there’s a thin crevice filled with Fire Bellflowers to harvest. The crevice leads to a fallen rock forming a bridge to another Blazebone and Licorice, and a path leading onward. \n\n\n\nBefore you do that, instead take a left to where the sun shines down on a large rat statue and a curved wall, as well as a large pit. The pit holds one last major boss to deal with, which can arrive in a few ways.",
