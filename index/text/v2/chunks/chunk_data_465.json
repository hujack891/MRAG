Immediately turn to the right, to pick up the first green Wisp in the region. \n\n\n\nGo straight up toward the valley, but be careful as you explore the area. Some of the rocks in this area glow with lava, and that's because they're actually Searing-Fire enemies. These resemble the Palestones from Chapter 2 and are particularly annoying. They will leap in the air and drop on their back and front to cause explosions. For the sake of unlocking portraits, you can defeat just one and ignore the others. \n\n\n\nContinue straight up, following the gold trail to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine. It's protected by an Earth Rakshasa, so either use heavy attacks to break down its shield, or get behind it to tackle it. When you've dealt with it, activate the Keeper's Shrine.",
