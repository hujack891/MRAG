Head up to find a Shrine on the left, and be sure to check the shop in this secret realm, as it offers wares not sold in the rest of the Yellow Wind Ridge: \n\nKingdom of Sahali Shrine Shop   \n---  \nFortifying Medicament (x3) - 360 Will |   \nCold Iron Leaves (x2) - 900 Will | Refined Iron Sand (x1) - 1200 Will   \nLicorice (x3) - 120 Will |   \n  \n\n\nAs you round the corner, you’ll be told to halt by the defender of a large gate: A slightly familiar looking Tiger Guai who calls himself the Vanguard of the Yellow Wind King. If he looks familiar to another Vanguard you’ve faced, that’s because he’s actually the other Vanguard’s father! He’ll ask that you turn around and head home, which seems like such a waste with all you’ve gone through just to get here.",
