The Soak's ability is basic when compared to some of the Epic Soaks in the game. \n\nWith the Tender Jade Lotus Soak equipped, using the gourd slowly recovers a small amount of health for a short duration. This is a small added boost to your healing on top of your Drink of choice. \n\nSoaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor.",
