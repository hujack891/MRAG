    "content": "While the Red Loong Dragon can be found in Chapter 1’s Black Wind Mountain, you will not be able to access and challenge this secret boss until at least Chapter 2, when you begin to explore the Yellow Wind Ridge. \n\n\n\nHead through the Sandgate Village and defeat the King of Flowing Sand and his Second Rat Prince son. After defeating the pair (or only the son), head left from the boss arena and into the Valley of Despair. \n\n\n\nOnce you arrive in the large covered valley area, keep to the left to find a large lower platform by a slightly rounded red wall lined with small statues. At this point, if you did not kill the King of Flowing Sand, he’ll summon his other son, the First Rat Prince — otherwise you can use the Pungent Flesh Chunk to summon him yourself. \n\n\n\nWhile fighting the First Rat Prince, you can lure him into performing one of his large slam attacks when facing the rounded wall, and it will cause a crack to appear in the wall. If you are unable to lure the boss into forming a crack in the wall, you can even do so yourself by hitting it with a very strong attack - we recommend the Wandering Wight’s Spirit Attack, or the Azure Dust Transformation Spell’s final attack. \n\n\n\nYou can enter the crack in the wall, and on the other side you’ll find a chest containing the Loong Scales. With this item, you’ll be able to uncover the lair of the Loong Dragons. \n\n\n\nReturn to the Forest of Wolves and head to the Outside the Forest Shrine. \n\n\n\nFrom here you’ll want to stay along the paths to the left to head up and then over to an area with a large waterfall and four statues. With the Loong Scales, you’ll hear a voice speak to you, which means you’re in the right spot. \n\n\n\nYou can now find a spot to interact with in front of the large waterfall, using the power of Loong Scales to evaporate the waterfall, and reveal a path to the Red Loong Dragon.",
