Head up this hill to find the Lambrew sitting at the top. \n\nYou can then take the Lambrew to the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove in Black Wind Mountain by travelling via the Shrines. He will let you switch it into your Gourd from the Coconut Wine or any other drink you have. \n\n\n\nLambrew\n\nThere aren't too many Drinks in the game compared to the Soaks, so be sure to keep your eye out for them.
