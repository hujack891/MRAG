Just ahead on the right you'll find the North Shore Shrine, with the shore extending in both directions for optional areas to explore with bosses. However, if you want to hurry ahead, you can also look for a frozen tunnel a little ways to the right and proceed in toward the Precept Corridor. \n\nSince there's a good deal of important optional stuff (including some that can be missed if you proceed too far!) we'll start off checking the left side of the shore when facing the away from the water. \n\n\n\nThe good news is Zhu Bajie has now agreed to accompany you, and despite his size, the little pig is a handy follower to have. Not only is he pretty adept with his rake weapon, and can also belch poison at enemies, he can also expel a healing mist to help you recover your health and save on using your gourd! \n\n\n\nStart by heading along the shore and defeating various Frozen Corpses, and look for a small building in the distance by the water's edge. As you near it, you can also spot a dragon man standing alone in the shallows. Zhu Bajie seems to know him, but as you approach, you'll be pulled into another boss fight.",
