    "content": "Much like Captain Lotus-Vision, the second Captain of the Pagoda Realm is a creepy one, with a strange construct-like shape with four legs, housing an golden sphere adorned with dragons that serves as its central core. The rest of the construct is highly resistant to damage, meaning you'll need to stun it so that you can take a shot at its most vulnerable part. \n\nOnly one of its legs is susceptible to attack, where you can see an orange glow emanating from its front right leg, so try to focus your attacks there whenever possible to try and stagger it. \n\n\n\nCaptain Wise-Voice has a lot of unorthodox attacks, made by violently spinning its golden sphere of a head around to emit thin beams of light. If you start to see beams erupt in different directions, start strafing to get distance, and prepare to dodge or sprint away when all the beams finally flash down in your direction at the same time. \n\n\n\nAfter a short delay, he'll perform another blast as the laser cuts upward, requiring a second dodge. \n\nOther times, it will create a sustained laser much faster, roving around you to slash upwards, and then create a trail of lightning strikes in a vertical line you'll need to quickly strafe to outpace. \n\n\n\nIt can also generate electrical power in its front leg, and stomp down to create a ring that extends outward, requiring you to dodge over it or use the Pillar Stance to evade it entirely. \n\n\n\nOther times, it will perform a series of slow stomps, causing multiple electric spots to appear around you. You'll need to sprint away from these spots before a delayed lightning blast can strike the ground where you are. \n\n\n\nCaptain Wise-Voice also has a number of up close melee stomps, smashes, and kicks you'll need to be wary of when attacking the hoof, which can be hard to anticipate with the camera angle. Whenever you see it start to move erratically, that's your cue to back up and be ready to evade. \n\n\n\nCertain times, it can even perform a charging attack by moving its head down, but you can lure it into charging the wall and dazing itself, letting you score a bunch of free hits. \n\n\n\nAfter taking a bit of damage, the boss will charge up to emit its \"beguiling chant\", blurring your vision somewhat, and performing an effect similar to when you were ascending the prison. Thankfully this will only lower your maximum health by around a fourth, and still give you a damage boost in return. The effect doesn't last forever -- only for around a full minute -- so make the most of it! \n\n\n\nOnce enough damage has been sustained to its leg, you'll see its leg start to explode with light, meaning your attacks have successfully staggered the boss. He'll fall to the ground in a heap, with its sphere-like core right in front of you. \n\n\n\nThis is your best chance to get in some real damage, but it's worth noting that a big charged heavy strike can sometimes knock it completely out of its dazed state. Instead, build up some more focus with one or two light combos, and then expend all your focus points on a bit charged hit to end its daze, taking off a huge amount of health in the process. \n\nRepeat the process of damaging its leg, or look for any opportunities to strike at its head -- particularly when it triggers the beguiling chant again to take off a chunk of your maximum HP. \n\nHowever, you'll also need to be ready to deal with its one major attack, which usually comes after you've assaulted its sphere at least once. \n\nAt a certain point, the construct will step into a corner of the room while the sphere lifts up and float high up toward the center, spinning wildly. It will send out beams of electricity in all direction as it twirls around, and the music swells. \n\n\n\nKeep strafing, and wait for lasers to start hitting the ground near you to trigger incoming lightning strikes on your position. This is a great time to use Cloud Step to give it the slip, allowing you to conserve stamina for the final act. \n\nEventually, you'll see the entire floor light up with criss-crossing lines over almost every inch of the surface. Keep dodging the lightning strikes, and as soon as the floor glows red, hop onto your Pillar Stance to extend off the ground (the more stamina you have built up, the better). \n\n\n\nWith a massive blast, the ground will explode in color, dealing a ton of damage if you aren't grounded at the top of your staff, and then the sphere will return to the construct body. \n\n\n\nTo defeat him, stay patient by building up focus points with sustained damage on his leg, using your Spirit Attacks too to rack up damage so that it can stagger the boss, then unleash more combos before your biggest charged up strike to maximize damage to his weak point before he rises. Use Cloud Step to get away from some of his more pesky lighting strikes and beams, and use Immobilize to stop Lotus-Vision's wild melee stomps and attacks (it generally doesn't work to help extend his stunned state). \n\n\n\nWhen Captain Wise-Voice finally falls to your assault, the Pagoda Realm will at last be free of his beguiling chant. This means you can head down to re-explore if you missed any areas without worrying about the debuff (but it also means any Sentry Lanterns not killed are gone forever). \n\nCaptain Wise-Voice\n\n\n\nLike Captain Lotus-Vision, you'll also get The Spirit of Captain Wise-Voice that can't be cultivated. You can now step out through the opposite opening to exit this pagoda, and you can check the rim of the cliff to the left to find a **Treasure Chest** with materials inside.",
