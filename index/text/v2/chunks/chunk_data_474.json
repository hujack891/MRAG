If you haven't already got your hands on these Skandhas, follow our guide to collecting them all here. \n\nGo to the clearing behind where you fought the Son of Stones, just off to the left. You'll see some water, a large rock to the left of it, and two golden trees on either side of the rock. You want to go to the right of the water to find the secret area that will take you to the hidden boss. \n\n\n\nYou'll need to ascend quite high up, but where the path reaches a dead end, up above there's an opening in the cliff that you can pass through. Follow this until you enter an area that's slightly covered and pass through this tunnel. \n\n\n\nAs you emerge in the wide open space, a Giant Shigandang will appear.",
