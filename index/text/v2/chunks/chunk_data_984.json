Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of The New West: Snowhill Path, as well as how to win your first encounter with Macaque Chief, and defeat the mighty Kang-Jin Loong. \n\n  * **Jump to a Section:**\n  * **Frost-Clad Path**\n    * Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n  * **Mirrormere**\n    * Yaoguai Queen - Kang-Jin Loong\n\nIn Black Myth Wukong's third chapter, the Destined One will travel far from the arid deserts to the snowy mountaintops of The New West, where you'll spy an odd character masquerading as a statue. \n\nOnce you've taken off your own disguise, you'll find yourself in a frozen cave full of giant statues with only one way forward. That way is blocked by a tough looking new enemy, the Monk Supporter. \n\n\n\nThese foes are fairly slow but durable, and will use the large stones they carry to try pummeling you with. Thankfully, they are fairly susceptible to being deflected with Rock Solid. \n\n\n\nHead up the stairs at the end of the path to reach a high ledge in the cave, and on the way down you'll meet another new enemy. These Cyan Bats like to cling to ceiling and drop down to ambush you. While they are way less durable than the Swift Bats of the Yellow Wind Ridge, they can dive at you with their spears, or send ice attack projectiles your way that will try to inflict you with frostbite. If they try to dart out of reach, use the Thrust Stance to chase them down. \n\n\n\nBe sure to look to the left as you head down from the ledge, and you'll find a small pool of water with some Jade Lotus, and another Monk Supporter guarding a**Small Chest** , likely containing some Cold Iron Leaves and other materials. \n\n\n\nHead upwards to a break in the cave as the snowy wind billows down, and prepare for the low visibility to mask another Cyan Bat hiding around the corner.",
