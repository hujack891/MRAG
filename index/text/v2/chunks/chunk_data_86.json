He'll run off to the front of the Turtle Island where the giant beast's head is, and you can follow him to get the main story moving to the rest of the Bitter Lake area, but there's a few things worth checking out here first. \n\nBack at the Turtle Island Shrine below where you faced Kang-Jin Star, be sure to explore the left side of the \"island\" (when facing up toward the turtle's head). \n\n\n\nThere's many ledges along this ridge you can explore. Many of them have a couple of Frozen Corpses lying in wait, but be on the lookout for a small altar with a gold pot on dis. You can open it and find another **Celestial Jade Lotus Pill** to increase your maximum health. \n\nThe New West Celestial Jade Lotus Pill\n\n\n\nDrop down even further to lower ledges along this left side, and you can find a narrow ledge leading through a tiny tunnel over to where a **Treasure Chest** can be looted for materials. \n\n\n\nHead past the chest to find another trail leading past it, and watch for two Cyan Bats in another small tunnel with a green Wisp, leading to a Tree Pearl to harvest. \n\n\n\nLook for ledges to jump up past the Tree Pearl, and you'll find another section ending in some braziers beside a second **Treasure Chest** with more materials. \n\n\n\nMost of the opposite side of the turtle boasts more criss-crossing ledge paths with Frozen Corpses or Golden Lotus Guai, and a few green Wisps stashed away in corners you can absorb, but not much more than that. \n\nThe biggest secret lies directly to the right of the Turtle Island Shrine when facing toward the front, but it will require you to have obtained the Loong Scales back in Chapter 2 behind a wall you can crack where the First Prince of Flowing Sands is summoned. \n\n\n\nAs you start exploring the path over to the right, an echoing voice will lead you to a large open platform where dragon humanoid figure appears to be frozen in place with its fishing rod. If you interact with it while holding the Loong Scales, it will crackle to life, and begin a new secret boss fight.",
