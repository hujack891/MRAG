As such, you’ll want to equip yourself with the best possible gear in Chapter 2 — you may even want to complete the chapter and return back from Chapter 3 if you find yourself unable to make a dent in this boss. Make sure you’re stocked up on medicines to help bolster your damage output and damage reduction. \n\n\n\nThe Mad Tiger will begin the fight with a fast leap, landing with a slashing single blow you’ll need to dodge and then retaliate. \n\n\n\nOther times, he’ll perform a feinting strike by leaping to one side of you with an uppercut, and then changing direction to slam down after a delay in your direction. \n\n\n\nThere’s another leaping jump he can perform to twist his body high in the air like his brother before crashing down, only this attack also sends his head slamming into the ground. This can work in your favor with a well-timed dodge, as he slowly recovers while grabbing his head from the impact. \n\n\n\nHe may not have a sword, but the Mad Tiger’s fists work just fine, and can employ many combo attacks. His most common one starts with an uppercut punch, and then a downward strike after a short pause, and is then followed by a huge sweeping claw swipe that spins him around. If you want to try using Rock Solid, save it for the swipe so he doesn’t attack through his first two swings. \n\nAnnoyingly, he can also employ a similar strike with only the first two hits, but at a much more rapid pace. \n\n\n\nHe also has a different combo strike that often begins with a downward fist punch, followed by two large horizontal claw swipes that spin his body, and ends with him ripping his fist out of the ground in a rising swipe as he leaps backward with the momentum. Immobilize him before he can retreat if you want to retaliate. \n\n\n\nMany of his attacks can then transition into two quick claw swipes with each hand where his arms will remain across his body, and after a moment, will violently lash out with both arms and an outward cross slash you can try to Immobilize to stop. Rock Solid can also help, but it’s unlikely to stagger him out of the move. \n\nJust be wary, as he’ll often follow up the two arm slash by leaping straight up into the air before crashing down in a slamming attack. \n\n\n\nAfter beating on him for bit, you may sometimes hear him yell out in anger, which will be a quick tell that he’s about to perform an ear-shattering roar that can damage you if you’re near him, and will also cause rocks to fall from the ceiling onto you, and will require quick thinking to avoid. \n\n\n\nIn this rage-filled state, he’ll unleash even more leaping attacks, like a foot-first jump ending in a slam with his right arm, before spiraling upward with another rising claw swipe as he propels himself into the air, and back down onto you for a huge slam that will shatter the earth around the point of impact. \n\n\n\nAnother extremely deadly combo he can perform after a roar seems to last forever, making it an ideal time to try Immobilizing him or using a Transformation Spell if you’re in danger of dying from his assault. He’ll race around you before leaping close with a claw strike, followed with a delayed upward slash, and a second soon after, before keeping his arm raised for a moment and then punching down with two hits in quick succession, and a final delayed two-handed slam! Be sure you have enough stamina to keep up sustained dodging for this very long combo attack. \n\n\n\nAnother variant after his roar that’s a bit more rare to see — usually when you have some distance on him, is that he'll perform a longer bloodcurdling roar, and then shoot a projectile out of his mouth at you with little warning! \n\n\n\nThere are certain times after performing slam attacks that he may keep his claws deep in the ground. If he continues to crouch down while charging up, it means he’ll rip his fists out to send a shower of rocks erupting in your path. \n\n\n\nOther times, he’ll begin to pick up a massive boulder, but instead of tossing it, he’ll leap across the room to personally deliver the massive rock to your face, which can deal a ton of damage. \n\n\n\nAnd if the rage-filled roars and resulting deadly attacks weren’t bad enough, the Mad Tiger also has a secret grab. It seems to happen most often in retaliation for getting staggered, causing him to fall to his knees placing one hand on the ground. As he rises, he’ll do so with a quick leap toward you, landing with a quick uppercut. \n\n\n\nIf you don’t dodge as he lands, he’ll send you into the air, grab you, and slam you repeatedly into the ground — which usually ends in instant death if you have anything less than full health. \n\n\n\nExpect this fight to take a lot of practice, and considerable upgrades in skills on your part to deal enough damage to survive the fight.
