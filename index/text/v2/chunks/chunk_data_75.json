This will grant you the Alteration, Strand, and Transformations skills. \n\nAlteration applies to spells like Cloud Step and Rock Solid and will improve the health of your decoy, movement speed, and unlock the chance to deflect attacks with a parry. \n\nThe Transformations menu applies to any Transformation spells you collect and you'll find skills to improve might recovery, maximum health when transformed, increased defense, and more. \n\n\n\nFinally, in the Strand menu, you'll find the spell A Pluck of Many, where you can send out multiple Duplicates to help you. The skills you can unlock here will increase the health of your Duplicates, along with their attack power, and more.",
