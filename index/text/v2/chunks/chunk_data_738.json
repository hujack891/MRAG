It allows you to take the form of Non-Able and deliver a flurry of blows on your foe. The attack itself is fine, but the equipped effect is quite harsh and will render Non-Able more or less unusable, depending on your style. Non-Able's equipped effect raises your Attack, Critical Hit Chance, and Critical Damage but massively reduces your Maximum Mana. And when they say massively, they mean it.
