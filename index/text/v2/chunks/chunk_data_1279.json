You found one route after defeating the Stone Vanguard that led down the sloping sand canyon to the gate itself, but there’s more doors we haven’t unlocked with the Sterness of Stone and Keeness of Tiger. \n\n\n\nReturn to where you fought the King of Flowing Sand and his Second Prince son, and unlock the large stone door here. You’ll find stairs leading down here, with a spot to the left leading back to another door that’s actually a shortcut to the Valley of Despair’s cave where you fought the First Prince. \n\n\n\nFurther down the stairs, there’s a large broken building to the right, and a Spearbone guarding a rope bridge up ahead. New enemies are lurking underneath the ruined building — Weasel Captains. \n\n\n\nThese quick enemies are tiny and easy to miss as they dart around you, looking for opportunities to lunge at you with their small swords. Luckily, they aren’t as overwhelming or powerful as the Civet Sergeants, so long as you don’t attract the attention of all of them at once. \n\n\n\nOn the other side of the ruined building, there’s a long roof-like walkway and several Withering Corpses milling about, along with a Ginsengling hiding by a wooden chest that holds 3 **Yaoguai Core**. \n\n\n\nIf you already used the Old Rattle-Drum back in Windrest Hamlet, you’ll again hear the spirit of a boy call out to you. Use the drum here, and prepare to fend off the zombies as he speaks to you. Interestingly, he mentions a secret and a well before clamming up, giving you one final clue to the third location. \n\n\n\nThere are many small wells that dot the Yellow Sand Ridge area, but the one you need to seek out is located back in Sandgate Village. Head back to the area where you fought the Earth Wolf and rescued the Horse Guai who was tied up by the large statue. \n\n\n\nLook to the left of that statue altar, and you’ll find a small field around the back with a concerning amount of skeletons, and a well. Using the Rattle-Drum here one final time will cause the spirit of the boy to appear before you, and invite you to hop down the well to meet a “friend”. \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there. You can interact with the well to drop down to a secret area, where you’ll face off against an incredibly tough and dangerous Mad Tiger Miniboss (who may even be tougher than all the other Tigers you’ve faced)! \n\nReturning to the second spot you ed the Rattle-Drum in Yellow Wind Formation, cross the rope bridge and you’ll contend with a few more Weasel Captains. \n\nRounding the corner, you can spot a large tree in the distance with telltale glow of a collectible hanging from it, but guarding it is a very creepy and unique miniboss.",
