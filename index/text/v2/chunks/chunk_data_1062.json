They share one health bar between them, and in your Stone Monkey transformation, you can use Primal Punch as your light attack, Earthshatter Slam as your heavy attack (this attack also heals), and Rock Solid to deflect their hits. \n\nUse Rock Solid when it's available and when one of the four giants will launch themselves at you. Other than that, you'll just want to keep using Primal Punch to build up Focus. When you've built your points, use Earthshatter Slam. \n\n\n\nAbout halfway through the fight, you'll also be able to start using Ice Bath. When you use the Ice Bath Spell, the Stone Monkey's arms will be covered in frost, and when you punch, you'll inflict frost damage. \n\nThe Four Heavenly Kings\n\nWhen the Four Heavenly Kings have been taken down, there's just one more giant to deal with, which is Erlang Shen.",
