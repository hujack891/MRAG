They tend to attack fairly slowly and draw out their sword slices giving you ample time to dodge even while using light combo attacks. \n\n\n\nSince the Destined One can dodge mid-attack, you should press your offense while dealing with these foes, and watch their movements to find the right time to leap out of the way. Your light combo attack comes in four sustained attacks, culminating in a strong overhead slam when performed uninterrupted. \n\nDefeating each of them will earn you a fair bit of Experience - seen by the yellow bar in the top right corner, as well as a bit of “**Will** ”, which serves as a form of currency. Given that you’ll need both to succeed in your adventure, it’s usually best to take on enemies you encounter rather than running past them. \n\n\n\nA voice will call out as you defeat the first two enemies, and we’ll be meeting the owner of this voice soon enough. For now, head straight up the woodland path, and you should spot a red plant to the right. Pluck it to gain some **Aged Ginseng** \\- a crafting material that we won’t be able to make use of until Chapter 2, but there’s no reason you can’t start stocking up on them now! \n\n\n\nWhen you reach the next Wolf Scout, you’ll be prompted to perform a Heavy Attack. Heavy Attacks work a bit differently here than in most other games: The more you land hits, the more your Focus bar in the bottom right corner grows. When it fills, you’ll gain a Focus Point, which allows you to add a Heavy Attack into your Light Attack Combos for massive damage. While you can still perform a Heavy Attack on its own, it will lack added punch without that Focus Point, and can’t be included in a combo attack without it. \n\nAlternatively, you can simply hold the Heavy Attack button to begin charging up your Focus, and letting go of the button will unleash the attack, which can be devastating on slow or unsuspecting enemies. It’s important to note that Focus won’t decay from performing light attacks, but you can’t keep the Focus from charging up, so knowing when to use which type of heavy attack can prove useful. \n\nHead up the stone stairway into a narrow path full of boulders, where the path splits in two: \n\n\n\nThe route on the left leads down to a Wolf Scout guarding a small gold chest, which contains 5 **Tiny Piece of Gold** \\- an item that can be sold at shops to earn more Will. \n\n\n\nTaking the path to the right leads to a stronger Wolf Stalwart. armed with a large axe. He’s built a bit tougher than the others, and has some hard-hitting and long reaching swings with his axe, as well as a quick shove attack that’s hard to anticipate and dodge before he follows it with a chop. \n\nIf you take a few hits, remember that you have a gourd of healing drink that you can use (LB/L1) to replenish a bit of your health, but it can only be used a few times. \n\n\n\nWith both enemies dead, you should start to notice a trail of gold leading you down the main path toward a shrine in a small rocky ravine. \n\nThese Shrines are your checkpoints, and offering incense at them will allow you to rest up, refill your healing gourd, travel to other shrines, and much more (some enemies — but not all — will respawn as well). You’ll also meet the owner of the voice on the wind - the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain. \n\nThis friendly guy will be your guide and mentor for this part of the world, and will bid you to set out in search of Guanyin Temple, which burned down long ago but has since been rebuilt - but not by human hands. As the Keeper departs, he’ll bestow you with the Incense Trail Talisman, which can let you warp back to the last Shrine you rested at.",
