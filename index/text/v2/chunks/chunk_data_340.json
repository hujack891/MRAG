The miniboss is located behind a large gate guarded by many archers, forcing you to take the long way around. \n\n\n\nTake the path to the right of the sealed gate, and fight past two Rat Captains while keeping the village shacks on your left. As you circle the area, you can find a pathway leading to an archway guarded by a Rat Archer and Rat Governor, and you'll find the boss inside.",
