You'll have to repeatedly thwack at his legs while avoiding various stomps or swings with his hellfire arms that can burn you. \n\n\n\nAt range, he can also tear up a huge rock from the ground and throw your way, making him a threat even at a distance (though the rock flies pretty slow). \n\nDeal enough damage, and the giant will eventually fall to the ground. Use this time to build up several focus points by attacking his head, and Spirit attacks to take more health away. \n\n\n\nAs he struggles to rise, unleash a heavy attack using your Pillar Stance on his head and he'll likely topple back to the ground giving you a bit more time to defeat him. \n\n\n\nBe sure to look around this area after defeating the overlord, and nearby you can spot a tree atop a large rock where a Wolf Guardian lurks over a **Treasure Chest** full of materials you can claim. \n\n\n\nIn the opposite direction, there's another large rock below a tower up above that you can't reach, but you can search the rock for another Lesser Apramana Bat, and nearby you can find a second **Treasure Chest** under a large tree. \n\nThe most interesting thing around here is just up the small hill past the tower. You'll find a large corpse of some kind at the base of a statue built into the cliffs ahead. \n\n\n\nThis is actually one of the four Captains that the Pagoda Realm Prisoner spoke of, but it looks like someone beat you to putting this captain out of their misery. You can still interact with the body to claim the Spirit of Captain Void-Illusion. And hey, since they still count as a Yaoguai Chief in the journal, that's one less boss to worry about! \n\nCaptain Void-Illusion\n\n\n\nThere's not too much else in the field around the high tower, but you can find a green Wisp to absorb both behind the tower, and along the nearby cliff wall below a large statue where a Crow Diviner enemy stands. \n\nHead back to the main road and defeat the various Frozen Corpses while you head toward a large arch where the Shrine is, plus a green Wisp to absorb. \n\n\n\nGuarding the Shrine is another Dual-Blade Monk, who thankfully won't respawn when killed, so feel free to go all out with your spells to overpower him after deflecting an attack to stagger him. \n\n\n\nFrom here, the large main field in front of you hides several more Frozen Corpse ambushes, plus Falcon Fan-Makers who will try and stop you from reaching the New Thunderclap Temple. However, there is one last side area worth checking out. \n\nLook for a lower path leading left of the Shrine, and you'll find a road leading along the ridge above the Towers of Karma into another wooded area. This place is effectively one big loop, with a lower and upper path to take. \n\n\n\nThe lower path will lead past another Crow Diviner, and up some stairs to an area with several stone monuments where the path diverges. \n\n\n\nA glowing pot can be seen on a small wooden platform, but guarding it is a new formidable opponent. The strangely named Turtle Treasure is a stout skull-faced yaoguai with a large mace it can use to swing in wide arcs or slams, and can also thrust out its belly at you like the Frog Guai bosses, or leap into the air for a butt slam. \n\n\n\nWhat makes them truly dangerous is the more they swing their mace, the more small fires will begin to appear around it. Once the fires have grown, any of their weapon slams will now deal huge explosions that can be a pain to deal with. \n\n\n\nMake use of your spells to keep the foe off-balance and to get away from their explosive attacks, and once they've been defeated, jump and perform a heavy attack to smash the glowing pot on the small wooden platform to gain an Awaken Wine Worm! \n\nLongevity Road Awaken Wine Worm\n\n\n\nIf you want something to pair with that worm, keep moving along the lower path as it goes up some stairs, and you'll eventually reach the end of this loop, where a small tree stands at the end of a large field with a Luojia Fragrant Vine. However, you'll need to defeat not one but two Falcon Fan-Makers to claim it! \n\n\n\nDefeating the pair is no easy attacks when you consider their hit-and-run tactics, so you may need to even the odds with A Pluck of Many Spell, or use a combination of Cloud Step and Immobilize to isolate and focus fire one of the Falcons, and then take out the second. \n\nLongevity Road Luojia Fragrant Vine\n\n\n\nOnce you have the vine, take the upper path back toward the Longevity Road Shrine, where you'll encounter a two Crow Diviners - one up on a ledge to lure you, and a friend hiding in the bushes nearby. \n\n\n\nThe most important note is that you can find another Dark-faced Overlord here.
