    "content": "Past the Tiger Vanguard, you’ll find a pretty staggeringly big open desert landscape for a Secret Area. There’s not as much to do as it may look like, but there are a few secrets worth picking up before talking to the big guy on the cliff. \n\n\n\nThere are more than a few plants to gather that are scattered around the upper plains here, including Licorice. If you move straight ahead, you can find the Sandgate Bound Shrine by some rocks before the large cliff. \n\n\n\nIf you search the left side when facing the central cliff by the Shrine, you can explore some ruins to find a chest by some wooden columns that contains a **Gold Ridge Beast** to sell, and **Knot of Voidness** material that can be used for advanced Spirit Cultivation. \n\n\n\nFurther down this left side, avoid falling down the sandy slopes until you reach a rocky area by the very far edge of the lip of this ridgeline. Look carefully, and you can spot the final **Meditation Point** for Chapter 2, granting you a free Spark Skill Point. \n\nThe Rock, Sandgate Bound Mediation Spot\n\n\n\nNext, search the far right side of this sandy area above the slope, until you come to the farthest edge by the rocks. Here you’ll find another wooden chest, and inside you can grab a **Mind Core** , 4 **Yaoguai Core** , and 523 **Will**. \n\nNow head up the middle cliff to find none other than the Yellow Wind Sage — only its a version of him from the past. Since your goal isn’t to fight this incarnation, you’ll actually be able to offer your help in defeating another Yaoguai King - a legendary and dangerous scarab who haunts the sands below. \n\n\n\nThe yellow-furred rat is at an impasse, as the scarab’s magic is preventing him from engaging the monster directly. This is where you come on. The Yellow Rat Sage will agree to pound the drums to force the scarab to the surface, allowing you to engage the behemoth directly and find whatever vessel is giving it its power.",
