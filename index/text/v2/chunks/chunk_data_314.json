    "content": "The Daoist Mi is an initially non-hostile NPC that is found while exploring the secret area in Purple Cloud Mountain -- which you can activate by defeating the Venom Daoist twice both in the Webbed Hollow and Temple of Yellow Flowers. \n\n\n\nAfter resting at the Petalfall Hamlet Shrine, head up the path and across a small bridge to enter the small village. It's now overrun by various Daoists, which shouldn't prove too much of a problem if you take them out one at a time. \n\n\n\nHowever, after climbing some stairs, you'll come across a special Sword Daoist ing a flute, and does not appear hostile. He'll actually ask a favor of you, noting that his fellow Daoists have all been partaking of Amourworm eggs, turning them into undying husks. He'll ask you to seek one out and return it to him. \n\n\n\nWhile it may sound like he's asking you to seek out a Worm Practitioner, in reality any of the Daoists you defeat in this hamlet has a chance to drop the item he seeks. We'll clear the village out before returning to him, but you may also need to rest and respawn them if you don't find one. \n\n\n\nHowever, once you return it to him, he'll reveal that he want the egg's power all to himself, and is willing to kill for it.",
