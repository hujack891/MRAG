To find him, you'll need to explore an optional path once inside the temple grounds. \n\n\n\nFrom the Temple Entrance Shrine, take the far right path and head up a narrow sloping path filled with Supporter Monks to find a side area, and continue through the large gate past where Censor Holders are praying, and the monk will jump out of an altar as you enter the next large open part of the temple grounds.",
