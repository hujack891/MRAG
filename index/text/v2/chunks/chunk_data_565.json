Generally speaking, when an enemy initiates their attack, that's the moment you want to press R2 and Triangle (PS5), RB and Y (PC/Controller) or 2 (PC/Keyboard). \n\nEach enemy will have different timings to their attacks, however, so it might take some practice getting it right for the different Yaoguais. Look for visual prompts such as enemies raising their weapons and shields or leaning back to spot the start of their attacks. \n\n\n\nEach successful use of the Rock Solid spell will result in sparks flying and a \"ching\" sound, letting you know you've got it right and deflected. With lesser Yaoguais, parrying with Rock Solid will stagger them for a few seconds and leave them open to counterattacks. \n\nKeep in mind, however, that you**cannot block attacks** , and deflecting with Rock Solid **cannot stagger all enemies**.",
