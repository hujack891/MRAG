Found a little deeper into the game, it has a rather powerful buff, which can save your life in a fight or against a tough enemy. \n\nWith the Laurel Buds equipped, using the Gourd will moderately increase the damage reduction for a short duration of time. This duration is rather short, but it can be the difference between life and death in a pinch or one of the tougher boss fights in the game. \n\n\n\nSoaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd itself, so you are stuck with the length of this damage reduction. It can't be increased, so, if you want to switch to a different Soak, be sure to head back to the Shen Monkey Vendor.",
