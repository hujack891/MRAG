From here, go up the slope toward the Upper Hollow Shrine. \n\n\n\nJust behind the shrine sits a torch and a wooden path that goes off to the right. Take this path and head up the stairs, then follow it until you get to the end, where there's a small drop down. \n\n\n\nYou should now see a large rock in the middle of the room with white eggs near it. Drop down and head right, sticking as close to the rock as possible. \n\n\n\nThere is a torch here by a broken wooden path. It will seem like a dead end beyond this torch, and a large pit below, but you can drop down safely. \n\n\n\nIgnore the tree branch in front and turn to the right, dropping down from the edge of the wooden ledge. Turn left, and you'll start to see white sacs lining the path. Head toward these and follow the path around to the left. Be careful as you go through here, as the sacs will open and insects will appear. \n\n\n\nIn the next room, continue on past the archer, and through the opening in the rocks on the right. You'll be immediately met with a giant mass of web, where you'll want to go left and continue following the path where the white sacs are. \n\n\n\nPass through here to enter a bigger room, with a set of stairs leading up to the next level. Go up here and follow the winding path along the right. \n\n\n\nWhen you get to the top, you'll see it branch off to the left (where the torch is) and continue onward. Stick to the path going onward, and follow this around to the right. This will bring you to your next shrine, which is the Pool of Shattered Jade Keeper's Shrine. \n\n\n\nFrom here, go right and continue following the path lined with spider sacs. As you reach the other side, you'll see a large white sac in the middle. \n\n\n\nGo near it and a health bar will appear for the Old Cocoon. Hit it to destroy it, and eventually reveal the Venom Daoist. When you beat him, he'll run off and allude to settling the score with you once he's reached his full mastery.",
