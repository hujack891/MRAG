Head to the right first to find a Monk Supporter standing over a green Wisp you can absorb, and then take the other path. \n\n\n\nContinue up the stairway until you find an opening to the left, where you'll enter a hall of statues and a Red-Haired Yaksha blocking your path. He's glowing blue from an empowered spirit, but thankfully with a friend at your side, things should even out in difficulty -- but you should still watch out for their powerful martial arts punches and bicycle kicks. \n\nDefeating this foe will earn you the Red-Haired Yaksha Spirit, and Zhu Bajie will ask that you go rest at a nearby raised pavilion in a large open area nearby. \n\n\n\nAs you reach the pavilion, you'll encounter the same strange chubby little monk you may have spotted when first starting this chapter. The enigmatic monk seems interested in a Buddha statue up on the cliffs above with a big belly button, but it seems invisible to your eyes. \n\nThe monk will suggest \"why not worship around with true hearts, for Buddhas may light your path\", but what he really means is **four** Buddha. \n\n\n\nHead left from the pavilion, and you'll find one such large crowned Buddha statue between two columns that you can interact with and pray to. \n\n\n\nWith one Buddha located, it's time to find the rest. Keep heading left to the edge of the large open plaza to find a path leading down. Absorb a green Wisp as you go, and descend the long flight of stairs leading to the right. \n\n\n\nAt the bottom, you'll encounter another Wolf Guardian, but be sure to look to the right after defeating him, and you'll find the second crowned Buddha statue to pray at (A Frozen Corpse Censor Holder is already praying here, but you can cut in line). \n\n\n\nNext, head left through a narrow passage and defeat the Monk Supporter that guards it, before moving left again. Just before you reach the entrance to an underground tunnel, look on the right just past a series of wooden posts to find the third Buddha statue. \n\n\n\nGo inside the doorway into a dimly lit passage, and head right. Keep climbing upward and take out the two Monk Supporters that get in your way. \n\n\n\nWhen the passage finally ends in a small cave-like room, you'll find a Red-Haired Yaksha on the right guarding the final Buddha statue to pray at. \n\nLuckily, there's an exit to the left that will dump you out on a low wall (with a green Wisp down by a small tree) leading right back to the pavilion! \n\n\n\nReturn to speak with the monk, who ends up teasing Zhu Bajie some more before appearing up on the cliffs above, as a large Buddha statue materializes next to him. \n\nSadly, Zhu Bajie will send you off alone and promise to meet you at the summit, which will end your jolly cooperation for now. \n\n\n\nLook for a path to the right of the pavilion and start heading up the winding stairs that criss-cross along the cliffs filled with statues. \n\n\n\nBe on the lookout for various green Wisps to absorb as you ascend, and once you make a hard left to a flat area with a giant red-robed statue nearby, keep an eye out on the right for a **Treasure Chest** full of materials hiding in an alcove. \n\n\n\nDeal with any shambling Frozen Corpses you'll find along this ledge, and keep heading along this path past the large statues to find a slope leading upwards, and a green Wisp behind the last large statue. \n\n\n\nAs you climb up, you'll find yourself right in front of the Buddha Statue in the cliffs, and an opening has appeared right through his belly button!
