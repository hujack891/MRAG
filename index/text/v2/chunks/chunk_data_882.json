You have to crack a wall in the First Prince of Flowing Sands boss room to get any idea they exist and it's not obvious that you can do this whatsoever. Either bait the boss to smash the wall for you or use powerful attacks from Azure Dust (if you finished the Man-in-Stone Questline) or Wandering Wight to split the wall. \n\nSqueeze through the crack in the wall to find a treasure chest that has the Loong Scales inside. Once you have them, a voice will speak to you (and will continue to do so whenever you're close to any of the hidden Loong bosses).",
