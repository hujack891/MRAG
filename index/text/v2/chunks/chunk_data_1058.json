It is highly recommended that you defeat both The Scorpionlord and Daoist Mi before taking on The Duskveil, as defeating it may cause them to disappear. \n\nTo reach Purple Cloud Mountain, you will have to defeat the Venom Daoist twice - both in the Upper Webbed Hollow, and in a side path outside the Temple of Yellow Flowers main area. This will unlock a mural allowing you to travel to this new area. \n\nOnce you reach the first main shrine at the Valley of Blooms, stick to the left side to find a path up to the Petalfall Village, and continue along either path up to reach the peak, where the main boss lies.",
