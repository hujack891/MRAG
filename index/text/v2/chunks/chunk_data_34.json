At the same time, you are able to absorb and convert Frost and Scorch to empower yourself, retaining access to the Destined One's Spells and converting any pre-transformation Focus for use afterward. \n\nThis spell is one of the most powerful thanks to its moveset: \n\n  * **Light Attack: Primal Punch - Unleash a rapid flurry of punches, building up Focus.** This is an immensely effective, series of rapid punches that deal a large amount of damage, building up Focus at the same time. \n  * Heavy Attack: Earthshatter Slam - Leap into the air, bringing both fists down with an earth-shattering strike. This attack can be charged. This chargable attack can be used on its own or in conjunction with Monkey Mind to deal a powerful slam. \n  * Spell: Monkey Mind - Build up Focus and cast a variety of spells. Upon casting the Spell, you can deal a variety of different powerful attacks by asborbing elemental effects nearby, dealing extra damage.",
