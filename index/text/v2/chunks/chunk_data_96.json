After defeating the pair (or only the son), head left from the boss arena and into the Valley of Despair. \n\n\n\nOnce you arrive in the large covered valley area, keep to the left to find a large lower platform by a slightly rounded red wall lined with small statues. At this point, if you did not kill the King of Flowing Sand, he’ll summon his other son, the First Rat Prince — otherwise you can use the Pungent Flesh Chunk to summon him yourself. \n\n\n\nWhile fighting the First Rat Prince, you can lure him into performing one of his large slam attacks when facing the rounded wall, and it will cause a crack to appear in the wall. If you are unable to lure the boss into forming a crack in the wall, you can even do so yourself by hitting it with a very strong attack - we recommend the Wandering Wight’s Spirit Attack, or the Azure Dust Transformation Spell’s final attack. \n\n\n\nYou can enter the crack in the wall, and on the other side you’ll find a chest containing the Loong Scales. With this item, you’ll be able to uncover the lair of the Loong Dragons. \n\n\n\nHead to the Fright Cliff on the opposite side of the Yellow Wind Ridge from the Valley of Despair, and travel through it to reach an area with the Rockrest Flat Shrine. \n\n\n\nDirectly to the right of this shrine, you can spot a stairway leading up to a large waterfall of sand that's otherwise impassible, and guarded by a tough Spearbone enemy that drops a Spirit. \n\n\n\nWith the Loong Scales, you'll be able to interact with the sandfall and remove it as a barrier, revealing a door behind it to take you into the Black Loong's lair.",
