When in the Upper Hollow, look for a ledge to drop down leading to the Pool of Shattered Jade past several hanging cocoons. In a small tunnel past the Shrine, you'll encounter a large cocoon that holds the Venom Daoist. \n\nAfter defeating him a first time, proceed through to the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Once you reach a fork in the road where the left path leads to the Court of Illumination Shrine, look for a path leading right up a mountain trail. Once you reach the top of the stairs, you'll find an alcove to the left leading down a large slope to an arena where the rematch will occur.",
