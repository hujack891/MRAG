Bait out the fighter and lure him out of range, or alternatively, you can dodge around him (or use Cloud Step) to ambush the Blazebones first, and then focus on overpowering the defenses of the Spearbone with careful timing. \n\n\n\nWindrest is a pretty sizable place, and full of ambushes, so be sure to advance cautiously. A third Blazebone waits on a raised wooden platform on the right as you enter, and a Withered Corpse sitting just below him. \n\n\n\nThe main path will lead straight on the other side of the long roof before you, but look carefully and you’ll spot a new type of ambush - The Rat Imperial Guard. They’ll leap off rooftops to surprise attack you, using twin hookblades for quick strikes, then dodging out of reach — and even throwing their blades at you from a distance. \n\nYou can use your new Rock Solid move to bait them into attacking and deflect to stagger them, opening them up for an assault which you can prolong by Immobilizing them when they try to flee, or use the Thrust Stance to hit them even after they jump away. \n\n\n\nMoving ahead, there are also paths to the right and to the left. Going right leads to another Blazebone and Withered Corpse, as well as a house next to the ranged attacker that holds a green Wisp inside you can absorb. \n\n\n\nHeading to the left side of the hamlet instead will place you between rows of houses and a large building on the side. Be sure to search the first house on the left to find a chest with 1 **Small Piece of Gold** and 3 **Tiny Piece of Gold**. \n\nDefeat the Rat Soldier guarding the entrance to the larger house, and be sure to check the far end of this street for a green Wisp to absorb with a Withering Corpse near it, then enter the courtyard of the large building. \n\n\n\nAnother Rat Imperial Guard will jump down from the rooftops to ambush you, and a Blazebone in the corner of the courtyard may try to give you trouble while you're otherwise engaged. Lure the Rat out of range so you can deal with him in peace, then go for the bone thrower. \n\n\n\nThe Boar’s Sobering StoneAfter killing the Blazebone in this courtyard, look around for an open shack across from a Fire Bellflower, and you’ll find a small glowing jar. Break it open and you’ll receive a **Sobering Stone** \\- the exact kind of item the drunk boar in the yellow robe needs to sober up back at the Fright Cliff. \n\nExit the large building to the side to find a larger open center of the village, where a Spearbone patrols near a few more Blazebones. If you stick to the left wall, you can find a walkway up to a group of ruined shacks. Here you’ll find a Rat Governor looking over a chest, but beware, he’s got several Rat Archers backing him up in the corners. \n\n\n\nYou can either try to lure them out by dashing around the corner, or use something like Cloud Step or Pluck of Many to confuse and draw their fire to take out the archers, and then the Governor. Once they’ve been defeated, help yourself to the spoils in the chest for 1 **Small Piece of Gold** and 3 **Tiny Piece of Gold**. \n\n\n\nReturn to the large open area to deal with the Spearbone and the many Withered Corpses sitting around. Be sure to check the far side before going up the main path, as you can break apart some wooden fencing to find a yard with another Blazebone guarding a wooden chest, and inside you’ll find 3 **Yaoguai Core** and a lot of **Will**. \n\n\n\nGoing up the main path to the back of the village, you’ll find a large gate with an arch where not one but three Rat Imperial Guard await you on the rooftops. To make matters worse, one of them is much stronger than the rest. \n\n\n\nConsider using your stronger abilities on this group, like transforming into the Rock Guai to slam down on them, use your Pluck of Many if you have the mana, or Immobilize the weaker ones to focus them down before turning your attention to the one wreathed in blue flames. Defeating this stronger Rat will award you the Rat Imperial Guard Spirit, allowing you to perform some slick and quick moves with their fast transformation. \n\n\n\nWhen you return to the large gate, note that there’s a spot to the left where you can harvest some Licorice, and absorb a green Wisp to regain some of your gourd. To the right of the gate is a large empty shack surrounded by Withered Corpses who don’t seem to move much without provocation. This area is actually important for later, so remember the spot. \n\n\n\nYou can still search some of the smaller homes to find a chest in one that holds 2 **Silk** and 3 **Tiny Piece of Gold**. \n\n\n\nOpen the large gate the Rat Imperial Guard were posted at, and head through to the other side. Be sure to look to the right as you open the gate, and you’ll find a tree with glowing flowers on it. Gather the **Luojia Fragrant Vine** , and be sure to return to the Shen Monkey later to improve your Gourd when you can! \n\nWatch out for another Lingzhiling in disguise nearby from the fragrant vine, and then travel up the path (check a small cave on the left for a green Wisp) and up to the Windrest Hamlet Shrine.",
