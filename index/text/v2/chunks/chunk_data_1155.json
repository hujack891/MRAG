To reach this area, you must first defeat the Venom Daoist in the chamber to the right of the Pool of Shattered Jade Keeper's Shrine. From there, revisit him again in an empty room on a path branching off to the right of the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Defeat him to unlock the secret area. \n\nOnce you're on Purple Cloud Mountain, head down the path, past the snake, and to the right to find Verdant Glow. It is standing in front of a tree with a Luojia Fragrant Vine growing on it.",
