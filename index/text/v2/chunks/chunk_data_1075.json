He is a particularly tricky boss, but our Captain Lotus-Vision guide goes over everything you need to know to defeat him. \n\nOne key tip, however, is to start the fight right when the alarm ends in the Pagoda Realm, which halves your health. That way, you can get through most, if not all, of the fight without losing a huge chunk of your survivability. \n\nThe Spirit of Captain Lotus-Vision",
