As you approach, several of these will spring to life with large talons, and begin to wobble back and forth while violently swiping. To make matters worse, it's not easy to target the aggressive Clawed Cocoons vs the other ones that can also be knocked around. \n\n\n\nTo make things a bit easier and safer (as long as you don't mind taking your time), we recommend simply charging up your Thrust Stance and expending 2 focus points to deal with any swinging threats immediately, and then beating around the empty cocoons like pinatas to better see the path ahead (and gain Will). \n\n\n\nAs you clear a path through the room, keep an eye on the wall to the right, and you should find a group of hanging cocoons blocking a small alcove. Inside, you'll find a **Treasure Chest** with random materials, but also a Beetle Captain that will burst out of a nearby cocoon! \n\n\n\nMake your way to the end of the hanging cocoon passageway, and rush the Dragonfly Guai archer up ahead. There's another green Wisp to absorb along the ledge before heading into the next cave tunnel. \n\n\n\nUp ahead you'll find... more hanging cocoons, and yes, many of them hide Clawed Cocoons. Thankfully, the passage isn't as big, but it does hide a few Puppet Spiders to throw into the mix, so don't panic and dive into the middle of the group. \n\n\n\nOn the other side, you'll find a stairway leading up to a long curved path in a large open room, with giant beams along the ceiling from which Puppet Spiders dangle. It's a good idea to pause here a moment, because there's a patrolling enemy who is a lot to deal with, you won't want to fight him with his friends. \n\n\n\nThe Scorpion Prince attacks with one giant claw, and his large poisonous stinger on his back, and each can be painful in their own right. He'll often charge at you with his claw and drag it through the floor to fling it upwards, or pounce at you from range, while following up with a tail swipe and second claw attack. \n\n\n\nWhen he goes to favor his tail, he'll perform a poisonous uppercut slash, then slam his tail down twice in quick succession, before a delayed final strike. Luckily this usually leaves him winded enough for you to get off a charged hit. \n\n\n\nThe good news is he won't respawn, so go all out with baiting his lunges to deflect with Rock Solid, and transform as needed to dish out as much damage as possible to send him sprawling. \n\n\n\nOnce he's defeated, you can lure down the first of several Puppet Spiders just past the stairs, but be sure to also turn around to find a small path up to an alcove with a green Wisp, and a ledge that will drop you back into the hanging cocoon passage. \n\n\n\nContinue up the long rounded path luring out the Puppet Spiders one at a time, and eventually you'll reach the far side of the large platform you saw across from the houses near the Upper Hollow Shrine. \n\n\n\nThe Pool of Shattered Jade Shrine can be found here, along with a **Meditation Spot** in the middle of the pool. \n\nThe Carvings, Pool of Shattered Jade Meditation Spot\n\n\n\nGrab the green Wisp on this side of the broken bridge, and then look past the Shrine for a small passageway full of -- you guessed it -- hanging cocoons. \n\n\n\nCarefully carve a path through the Clawed Cocoons to reach the other side, and you'll find yourself in a large chamber with an even bigger cocoon hanging down from the middle. Something angry is muttering to itself inside, and its apparently waiting for you.",
