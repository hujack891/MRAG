This effect is boosted with the Jade Moon Rabbit also equipped. \n\nCurios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out.",
