    "content": "Once you make your way down either of the slopes into the large sandy dunes where the giant Scarab Yaoguai called Fuban has emerged, you’ll be in for a battle against a juggernaut of a scarab beetle. \n\nDon’t let its imposing size scare you too much - this battle isn’t as hard as many others in Chapter 2 despite being a secret boss, as long as you know when and where to attack. \n\nFuban will likely begin by burrowing into the ground and vanishing, and the Yellow Wind Sage will call out to watch for the sands rumbling to tell where Fuban is approaching from. \n\n\n\nHe’ll then leap high into the air and try to crash down on you, which can be a bit confusing due to the camera angle, but you’ll need to dodge just before he crashes down (or use your Rock Solid, though it won’t stagger this boss). \n\n\n\nAfter he lands, you’ll be instructed to strike at its claws, so move yourself to the side and lock onto one of the front claws of the beast. Fuban won’t move around too much during this period, but may shake its head around requiring you to dodge a few slams. \n\n\n\nFuban can also slowly pull one of its claws back to then sweep upward in front of his face, which can damage you if you aren’t paying attention. If you’re worried about getting hit, you can also  it safe and stick with the Thrust Stance to hit its claws with a long range heavy attack. \n\n\n\nOther attacks can include swipes with both hands that sweep side to side, so even if one hand swipes past, don’t get too confident in thinking the danger has passed in case another claw on the other side sweeps your way. \n\n\n\nFuban can also rear back on its hind legs before slamming down to create a large shockwave, and will require a well-timed dodge, or you can turn into stone form to soak the blow. \n\n\n\nBe wary if you see Fuban start to pivot and turn away from you. It will duck down and show you the giant vessel attached to its carapace — a huge stone head — and then promptly ram it into you. This is a tough attack to dodge neatly if you aren’t expecting it, and will deal a ton of damage if it lands. \n\n\n\nOnce you’ve taken off around a third of its health, Fuban will back up and burrow back into the ground. Once again, it will start to swim through the sand at you, which your lock on will thankfully stick to. \n\n\n\nThis time, Fuban will swim right under you, and pierce upward with its horn to try and skewer you. The good news is that by using your Pillar Stance, you can raise up away from the explosion, and will only lose a chunk of stamina as the sand erupts, while avoiding damage. \n\n\n\nHowever, this won’t end Fuban’s underground reign of terror, as he’ll keep moving his horn up and down from below the sands to attack twice as his horn moves up and down, so keep dodging to stay out of the way. \n\n\n\nOnce Fuban starts another charge, he’ll repeat doing several leap attacks in a row that you’ll need to keep avoiding. Luckily, the Yellow Wind Sage will put an end to this by banging the drums more to stun Fuban entirely. \n\n\n\nAt this point, the battle will be paused and Fuban stunned, allowing you to climb up via its head to reach the large statue on its back. Jump onto the statue head, and look for a glowing eye to examine. You’ll then retrieve the Vessel that gives Fuban much of its power to fend off the yellow rat, who can now join you for the rest of the battle! \n\n\n\nIn this second phase, things will get even easier thanks to the Yellow Wind Sage on your side. You’ll be able to let him to the main talking. He can deal incredible damage with his wind attacks, which you can supplement by continuing the assault on his claws.You’ll still need to be mindful of his charge attacks and claw swipes, but you’re given more room to hang back and heal while the rat takes the brunt of his aggression. \n\n\n\nBy dealing enough damage, the Yellow Wind Sage can also knock Fuban to the ground. Be wary when approaching at first, if you see Fuban start to thrash left and right, it’s better to hang back, and wait until the rat can follow up with another powerful attack to stun Fuban until he lies on his side. \n\n\n\nThat’s your cue to rush in and hit Fuban’s exposed area with your biggest hits, using charged strikes, Spirit Attacks, and Transformation Spells to unload on the beetle before he can rise up. \n\nWhen following this strategy, you’ll quickly burn through the rest of Fuban’s health bar, and between you and the Yellow Wind Sage, the beetle will stand little chance. He can still repeatedly slam his head in the ground to create shockwaves, and finally pull up with a massive explosion. Again, the Pillar Stance can be useful for dodging these blasts, so long as you have a bit of distance away from him too. \n\n\n\nWhen he’s finally out of health, the battle will be won, and the Yellow Wind Sage will valiantly land the final blow. It’s a shame we’ll have to beat him up in the future. For your part in the battle, you’ll earn a Sky-Piercing Horn weapon material, and a new Vessel: The Wind Tamer! \n\nFuban\n\n\n\nJust as the Vessel from Chapter 1 proved a huge advantage against the Black Bear King, so too will the Wind Tamer be instrumental in negating the sandstorm attacks of the Yellow Wind Sage boss at the end of Chapter 2. Even outside of that fight, you can utilize it to grant additional damage negation, making it a great addition to your gear. \n\nKingdom of Sahali Complete",
