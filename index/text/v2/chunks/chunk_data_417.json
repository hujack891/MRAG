This is similar to the Rock Solid spell, but it doesn't stagger the enemy when timed correctly as Rock Solid does. It still deflects damage, though, which is the main drawcard of this Spirit. The equipped effect is also defensive, increasing your resistance to all Four Banes. This makes it a versatile Spirit to channel in the Webbed Hollow, the New West, and the Flaming Mountains. \n\nCheck out our other helpful Black Myth: Wukong guides! \n\n  * How-To Guides\")\n  * Key Items\n  * Walkthrough",
