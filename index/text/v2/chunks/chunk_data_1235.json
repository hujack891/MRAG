It also doesn't have any unique effect. \n\n\n\nWith it being given to you at the beginning of Chapter 1 - Black Wind Mountain, you can't craft it. However, it can be crafted into a variety of other weapons as you progress. \n\nWillow Wood Staff\n\nWeapons can be crafted throughout the game from the Shrines throughout the game's six chapters.
