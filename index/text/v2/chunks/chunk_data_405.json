However, depending on how you deal with his father and brother - the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince - there are a few ways he can appear. \n\nIf you didn't kill the King during the previous fight and only defeated the Second Rat Prince, the King will have fled -- to this very area in fact. When you approach, he'll summon his son, but meet an untimely demise. \n\n\n\nIf you did kill the King (and made his Second Son very angry), you'll have gained a Pungent Flesh Chunk Key Item from defeating the duo. This item can be used at the very edge of the valley's cliff to summon the First Prince himself.",
