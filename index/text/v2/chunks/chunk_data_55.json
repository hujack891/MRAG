After descending down past the Buddha's Right Hand and spying on the Spider Sisters, you can head down a long path with an optional passage through a fissure on the right. \n\nThis path will lead you to a ledge with an archer, and then right along the path above the main trail where the Lower Hollow Shrine is to where the frog boss waits in a flooded cavern. You can also climb up to the ledge from the Shrine by jumping and performing aerial heavy attacks.",
