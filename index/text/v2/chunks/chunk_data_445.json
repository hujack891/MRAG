    "content": "The Stone Vanguard is one of two bosses you must defeat to advance to the end of Chapter 2, and defeating it is no easy task. As a hulking monster of rock, the Stone Vanguard employs lots of tremor attacks and huge shockwaves whenever it slams its giant front arms down — which is most of the time. Cloud Step can be very useful for getting out of the way of incoming leaps, and then blindsiding it from the side to stagger it off of its current attack.",
