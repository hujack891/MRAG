The latter is armed with a shield, and can sometimes deflect your attacks to knock you off-balance. When this happens, watch for his counter and dodge at the last moment. A perfect dodge will slow down time and create an after-image of the Destined One, which lets you get in close for your own counter, and raises your Focus. \n\n\n\nCrossing the bridge will lead to a much more open section of this region. While Black Myth: Wukong is a fairly linear adventure, you will find that areas sometimes open up to allow for a bit more exploration off the beaten path, which can be essential for finding unique items and optional boss encounters. \n\n\n\nDefeat the next shield bearing Wolf Soldier down the road, and then another Wolf Stalwart guarding a **Purple Lingzhi** Mushroom you can harvest at the foot of a large tree. At this point, you’re likely to gain your first level up, giving you a “**Spark** ”. \n\n\n\nThese are essentially Skill Points, which you can begin investing in a large number of different Skill Trees. These can include general skills, or ones that relate to specific combat stances. Your Smash stance has already been unlocked, but you can also unlock two other stances that have unique heavy attacks by investing skill points in them. \n\nWhen the path leads down, you’ll be able to head right to proceed to a mini-boss, or go left along the stream leading back to the bridge you crossed earlier. \n\n\n\nGoing left should lead you to another Wolf Swordsworn behind a rock sculpture, and a **Gentian** plant near him that you can harvest. \n\n\n\nFurther down by the stream, you can spy a curious sight - a small Rat Guai will be looking around a small stone statue head at the end of the stream, before scurrying out of sight. If you go to check out what he was interacting with, you can touch the stone head to gain the **Skandha of Form** Key Item. Its purpose isn’t known just yet, but might be worth hanging onto… \n\nHead upstream to find another Purple**Lingzhi** by a broken tree, and two Wolf Scouts off to the right of the stream guarding a **Gentian** plant. \n\n\n\nWhere the stream widens and is full of more statue heads, you’ll encounter a few Frog Guai called a Croaky. They will hop toward you with sword in hand, and pause in midair before slicing forward, giving you a clear moment to dodge around them and counter. Just be sure you back away after killing one, as they’ll explode on death with poison gas. \n\n\n\nHarvest the **Jade Lotus** in the water before moving up toward the bridge you crossed earlier. On the other side of the bridge, the top of the stream is home to a lone Crow Diviner Yaoguai. He’s a lot tougher than the wolves, and can quickly slash with his reverse blade, either in a dashing strike, or a quick two-hit combo followed by a delayed third strike. The Crow can also jump up and slash down with powerful legs swipes, so be on guard to dodge around before getting your strikes in. \n\n\n\nHe’ll give a lot more experience and Will when defeated, and you can also loot a **Purple Lingzhi** on the left. On the right you can spot green wisps that denote wandering yaoguai spirits, but trying to gather them will only cause the wisps to fly off, giving you a fraction of their Will. \n\nHead back to the forest hill road, and this time make your way right to encounter your first mini-boss, a Yaoguai Chief.",
