Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. \n\nWith the Jade Moon Rabbit equipped your damage reduction is slightly increased. This effect is enhanced when you have the Gold Sun Crow also equipped. \n\nCurios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out.",
