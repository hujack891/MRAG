You can find a Lantern Holder patrolling further back by an archway, and a small shack to the left with a **Treasure Chest** where another Grasshopper Guai will ambush you outside, and Stone Spiders will burrow up inside by the chest. \n\n\n\nJust outside the shack, there's a small garden area with yet more Stone Spiders, and a Mushroom you can try to harvest only to reveal a formidable Fungiman instead. \n\n\n\nTo the right, another Dragonfly Guai will try to pepper you with arrows from a high ledge, but you'll also want to check the far left corner past the archway for the Estate of the Zhu Shrine. \n\nWhen resting at this shrine, it's a good time to remind yourself that you can start amassing resources to craft both the Golden Armor Set from beating Yellowbrow, and the Spikeshaft Staff. You should also plan to revisit the Zodiac Village, as both the Xu Dog and Shen Monkey will have new wares to sell (plus you may have better equipment to challenge the Yin Tiger if you haven't already). \n\nFinally, with the start of a new chapter, the Shrines here hold new items to buy in the shop: \n\nWebbed Hollow Shrine Shop   \n---  \nAntimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |   \nMind Core (x4) - 2400 Will | Cold Iron Leaves (x4) - 900 Will | Fine Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will | Refined Iron Sand (x2) - 1200 Will   \nGold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Will | | |   \nLicorice (x5) - 120 Will | Fragrant Jade Flower (x5) - 120 Will | Gentian (x5) - 90 Will | Withered Silkworm (x3) - 240 Will   \nSnake-Head Mushroom (x10) - 120 Will | | |   \n  \n\n\nJust up the stairs from the Shrine is a door, so once you've made all your purchases, upgraded gear, and given the Zodiac Village another visit, you can try knocking on the door. \n\nZhu Bajie will suggest a bit of subterfuge, disguising yourselves as the Wushan Lesser Guai who were hauling the chest at the start of the chapter. You'll be met by a shrewd woman, who will immediately figure out the little pig's disguise. She happens to have a disguise of her own, and will transform into her true self.",
