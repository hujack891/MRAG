But, the buff it offers is definitely useful for those looking for a pick-me-up in the middle of a fight. \n\nWith the Goat Skull equipped, using the Gourd moderately increases maximum health for a short duration. This duration is rather brief, but in the middle of a fight or when at low health, it can give you an extra buffer beyond your regular health to either be more aggressive, or flee and take out an enemy or two on the way. \n\n\n\nSoaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd itself, so you are stuck with the length of this health boost. It can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, be sure to visit the Shen Monkey Vendor throughout your game to continue equipping new ones.",
