There's a nearby open cell door you can find that has a **Treasure Chest** containing a few materials, guarded by a Withered Corpse. \n\nBeyond this lone cell, you can find the outside walkway path abruptly ends near a Frozen Corpse, and a darkened pit holds a series of rocky platforms you can drop down. The only thing down here at the moment is a cell with a purple seal, and a route back to where you first arrived in the Pagoda Realm, so unless you really want the green Wisp hovering over the drop back down to the start, it's better to leave this area for later. \n\n\n\nBack at the top of the stairs to the second level, head along the outside path to the right this time. The first open cell as you head this direction will have a green Wisp to absorb to replenish some of your gourd's healing charges. \n\n\n\nContinue past the next open area with a Frozen Corpse and Cyan Bat hiding nearby, and you'll pass another cell with a purple seal that holds a strong enemy with a Spirit inside. There's another Cyan Bat guarding this door, and an Abomination not far ahead waiting to lunge at you. \n\n\n\nYou'll need to cross a thin wooden beam next, and to make matters worse, a Yaksha Archer will be posted at the far end to harass you. Resist the urge to perform a mobile Staff Spin, as walking while spinning seems to automatically make you lurch to the side, and you'll plummet to your death. \n\nInstead, either stop moving to deflect, or take the blows and race to the other side -- but do take a moment to glance to the right at a large purple-lit chamber you can spy ominously through the bars. \n\nClear out the archer and the nearby Frozen Corpse after you finish crossing (thankfully the archer won't respawn once killed), and grab a nearby green Wisp to absorb before the outside path crumbles away, forcing you to head into the cell tunnel ring to keep moving forward. \n\nMove slowly through the darkened hall and be ready for ambushes from Abominations, Withered Corpses, and Cyan Bats on the ceiling. \n\n\n\nNot far after them, you'll encounter an Enslaved Yaksha. You can think of him as the Frozen Corpse in his prime, as he uses a similar very long sword, and can sweep in wide arcs with it, or thrust forward with a huge amount of reach. Luckily, his attacks are all very slow, and easily baited into a Rock Solid deflection. \n\n\n\nUp ahead, you'll finally spot the staircase leading up to level 3 that are guarded by an Abomination, but before you head up there's an optional and challenging encounter further down the hall. \n\n\n\nKeep proceeding past the stairs to find a Snake-Head Mushroom to harvest, and look left through an open cell gate to spy a Blade Monk perched outside on the ledge that you can poke off with a thrust attack. \n\nIf you head to the end of the cells, you'll find a green Wisp to absorb, and a ledge outside leading back down to a small outcropping below with a second green Wisp, and a one-way drop back to the very start (we'd recommend grabbing the next Shrine at the top of the stairs to Level 3 first). \n\n\n\nIf you look to the left of where the Blade Monk was posted to find a section leading back the way you came on the outside ledge. This will lead to a **Treasure Chest** that's guarded by a Yaksha Archer on a high ledge, and a Red-Haired Yaksha in front of the chest. \n\nThese guys are in a league of their own, and you may even want to wait until your max health is restored if you're currently under the effect of the beguiling chant's curse, as this enemy can kill you extremely quickly. Using their large forearm blade, the Red-Haired Yaksha can employ many strong martial arts attacks, including a sweeping lunge to close the distance in a hurry. \n\n\n\nHe can also fire off three projectiles after a retreating jump, and then follow up with a running kick to stagger you, before assaulting you with a series of sweeping strikes. Especially deadly is a series of two palm strikes with the smaller end of his forearm blade, followed quickly by a backwards jumping bicycle kick that can hit extremely hard without warning. \n\n\n\nIt's not a bad idea to throw off an Immobilize or Cloud Step to bypass the main fighter, and then run to perform a leaping heavy strike to reach the archer and get him out of the way first. \n\nOnce both combatants are dead, be sure to loot the chest, and head back into the cell tunnel, and upwards to level 3. \n\n\n\nA word of warning: You'll soon spot the telltale trail of gold that means the next Shrine is close at hand, but to reach it, you'll need to pass through one last tunnel section guarded by another Red-Haired Yaksha. If the last encounter proved difficult, you may want to Immobilize or Cloud Step and run past him to get the Shrine, rather than risk having to come all this way again. \n\n\n\nAs you reach the Upper Pagoda Shrine, you might notice a large pit nearby in the cell tunnel, with a familiar purple glow coming from below. You're right above where you crossed the wooden beam, meaning the strange chamber you saw through the window is also right below you, and it houses a very important but optional Yaoguai Chief. Defeating him will be the key to unlocking the purple seals you've spotted all over this realm, but it's also worth pointing out that until you defeat the Yaoguai King of this area, you'll have to defeat this optional boss with the chanting curse sapping half your health at any point. \n\n\n\nIf you're up for the challenge, carefully drop down onto a rooftop in the pit below to avoid taking fall damage, then jump onto rocky rubble below to face this foe.",
