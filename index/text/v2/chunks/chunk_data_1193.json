It will try to lunge and bite at you if you face it head-on, so this removes some of the problem of dodging those attacks. Immobilize will also help you out here, as similar to the rhino, it will move around and you'll want to be able to take advantage of those frozen moments as much as possible. Though you will want to watch out for it bucking and kicking back. \n\n\n\nThis fight is where your transformations can really shine, particularly Red Tides. Because it's a wood beast, it's easy to set it on fire with Red Tides attacks. It's also useful to be able to use the heavy attack and dash forward to catch up with it. Once you've built enough focus, perform a heavy attack in Red Ties to knock it over and set it on fire. \n\n\n\nYou can then detransform and follow up with your own strong attacks and it will continue to burn for a while until it douses itself off with the water. \n\n\n\nAs its health starts to get low, it will dive into the water and behave similarly to Jiao-Loong of Waves, where it will try to dive up and catch you by surprise. You'll see it emerge and peek up before it disappears again and the ground begins to rumble. You'll be able to see ripples in the water, that show you the exact path the beast is taking to reach you. \n\nWater-Wood Beast",
