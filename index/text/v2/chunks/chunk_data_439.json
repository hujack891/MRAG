However, your flight time will be limited by the meter slowly fading in the bottom left, and whenever you run out of juice (or manually de-transform) you may find yourself in hot water, so how much you actually want to explore in this form is up to you. \n\nThe main path through is area is a very straightforward one, as you can simply follow the straight path past the first two Wolf guards near the Shrine, to a axe-wielding Wolf Stalwart by a small bridge over a stream, and then straight through a tunnel that’s guarded by an extremely tough (and very optional) mini-boss with a giant head. \n\n\n\nIn fact, this Wandering Wight is tougher than most things you’ll face in the whole chapter, so don’t feel like you need to stop and contend with this foe if you’d rather get stronger and gain access to more abilities first. Be sure to check out our guide on How to Defeat the Wandering Wight when you do. \n\n\n\nThere’s more optional things to explore in this wide area however, starting by taking the path to the left past the first two Wolves near the Shrine. Past several fallen trees, some **Purple Lingzhi** and **Aged Ginseng** , you can reach a small peak with broken pillars and a Wolf guarding some pots to break for Will. \n\n\n\nNear this peak is a bridge, where you’ll find a Bandit Chief with a large sword guarding a chest. He can perform some surprisingly agile lunging attacks, and his multi-hit sword swings can deal a lot of damage. Each of his combos end with a large downward slam, and gives you a wide opening to begin your counter-attack as he struggles to pull his blade out of the ground. For as tough as he is, he luckily won’t respawn when defeated. \n\nOnce he’s gone, help yourself to the chest to find 2 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 5 **Tiny Piece of Gold**! \n\n\n\nThe bridge is guarded by a lone Wolf Archer, and a great time to test out the Destined One’s staff twirl ability. By holding down the L2/LT button, you can move your staff quickly to deflect incoming arrows. The Wolf will usually begin with a barrage of quick arrow shots, so be sure to keep holding the button down rather than tapping it until he stops. The move costs stamina to maintain so you can’t block shots forever — as soon as the arrows stop flying, dash across and defeat him before he finds more arrows. \n\n\n\nThere are many paths to go from here - either continuing to the far side of the stream, or heading back to keep exploring the previous side, including a path up to a high plateau with some **Aged Ginseng**. On the slope leading back down to the stream, another ginseng plant hides a surprise, as an earthen elemental Ginsengling Yaoguai will uncover itself with the ginseng growing from its head. \n\nThese monsters are surprisingly tough, and can slam their hands into the ground to grow poison roots that spread outward — so don’t be afraid to reposition yourself to fight somewhere else. Defeating them will earn you much more crafting materials than picking normal plants. \n\n\n\nFrom here, you can cross the stream to battle some more Wolf enemies on the other side, or look for a small path to the left leading up to a large waterfall with some **Jade Lotus** and another Crow Diviner enemy meditating by the falls. \n\n\n\nThe far side of the stream has many more materials to collect, and most importantly, a path leading from the bridge where the archer was to a small archway where another extremely important yet optional mini-boss awaits you.",
