With the shrine so close, go wild with your abilities and spells to quickly mow them down, then rest up. \n\nNow that you’ve defeated the Whiteclad Noble, new upgrades will be available for your gear in the Shrine’s menu — including three pieces of the Serpentscale Set, and the Twin Snake Staff that you can upgrade from your existing staff by using the Jade Fang the noble dropped. \n\n  \nNote that if you went ahead and defeated the Secret Boss by ringing the three bells, you should also have access to craft an additional Bronze Set that improves your abilities using the Immobilize Spell! \n\nCraft and upgrade whatever you can afford at the moment, because a boss is waiting inside the temple to test your might, and he’s no pushover.",
