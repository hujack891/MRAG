You will need to use this in conjunction with the Sterness of Stone Key Item, which can be found at Fright Cliff upon defeating the Stone Vanguard. \n\nThe easiest one of these Tallies to find is the one at the Crouching Tiger Temple, as it is in the arena where you fought the Tiger Vanguard. \n\n\n\nThe first gate can be found right next to the Sandgate Village - Valley of Despair Shrine. \n\n\n\nThen, the second can be found at the bottom of the sand hill leading on from the Fright Cliff - Rock Clash Platform Shrine, which is just after the Stone Vanguard fight. \n\n\n\nFor an even more detailed walkthrough of these areas beyond the Tallies, be sure to check out our full walkthrough.",
