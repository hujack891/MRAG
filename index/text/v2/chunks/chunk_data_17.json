It is integral to one of the main side quests in the Yellow Wind Ridge and accessing the secret Kingdom of Sahali area. The Arhat Gold Piece is dropped by the First Prince of Flowing Sands in Sangate Village - Valley of Despair area. \n\nTo summon the First Prince of Flowing Sands, you will first need to defeat King of Flowing Sand and Second Rat Prince. They are a mandatory boss, so you can't miss them. From there, you can then use the Pungent Flesh Chunk to summon the First Prince of Flowing Sands. \n\nDuring this fight, you will also want to ensure you get the boss to break the wall with the statues in the arena, by charging or hitting it with a powerful attack. This will open up another area, and allow you to access the Loong Scales key item. \n\nArhat Gold Piece",
