The fight also takes place on lava, so you are going to want to get your hands on the Xiang River Goddess Gourd, which grants you temporary immunity from the lava after you use it. That way, you can fight without having to worry about your health constantly depleting. \n\nYou can find the Xiang River Goddess Gourd in the chest-filled chamber you pass through on your way to fight the Elder Armourworm in the Webbed Hollow. \n\nWhile fighting Turtle Treasure, you will want to make sure to look out for the mallet it swings at you. A Pluck of Many or Immobilize makes this fight a lot easier if you don't have the Gourd.",
