Like before, it’s guarded by another Spearbone, along with a few Withered Corpses and a Blazebone shooting projectiles from the far side of the bridge. \n\n\n\nLure the melee attackers away from the ranged support and deal with them first before you cross, and the Blazebone will have little in the way of defending itself. Check the interior of the home near it, and you can claim a green Wisp for some Will. \n\n\n\nHead down the path around the homes, and you can find a wooden chest with 3 **Yaoguai Core** in an open area near a very long bridge leading back across the ravine toward Fright Cliff. However, a lone and imposing figure will block you as you try to cross the bridge.",
