Instead, give it a wack to find your old pal the Horse Guai on the next part of his adventure! \n\n\n\nOnce again he'll thank you for your part in helping along his quest, and will hope to cross your path again at the Flaming Mountains, so look forward to that! \n\nTalk to the Horse Guai some more to learn more of his story, and then head through the rest of the cocoon field, dealing with a few more Amourworms as you go. \n\nAfter climbing the path and leaving the cocoon field and Amourworms behind, you'll find another cave-like tunnel with the Cliff of Oblivion Shrine ahead. \n\n\n\nBe sure to turn around before you reach the shrine, and you'll find another Purple Talisman Altar, so be sure to collect a second talisman by interacting with it. \n\nJust past the altar, you can find a small house with a **Treasure Chest** in the front that holds materials like a Blood of the Iron Bull, and two Wasp Guais hiding around the sides. \n\n\n\nRest up at the shrine, and then head into the narrow passage to encounter a very disturbing sight: A very large hand holding a mirror.",
