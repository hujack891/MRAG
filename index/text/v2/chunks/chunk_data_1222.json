    "content": "While this fight will be a tougher one than the previous optional bosses you've faced in the Hollow, the Centipede Guai still has some predictable attack patterns that you can soon anticipate and counter and win the day. It's still worth having anti-poison Curios and Antimiasma medicine on hand. \n\n\n\nAfter he crashes into the skull pile, the armored bug boss will waste no time lunging through the air at you, and then launch into one of its more common attacks. \n\n\n\nWhen attacking from the front, he'll often slam down his head repeatedly to hit you with two times, and then quickly stand up while pivoting around to fall on its back to squash you with its armored hide. Be ready to dodge the third slam, and then immediately begin a combo attack while it struggles to rise up again. \n\nThe Centipede Guai can also perform two slow frontal sweeps with its main claws, alternating a claw on each side, but with its fairly slow swings you can step to the side to focus on its legs. \n\n\n\nIt can also rear back while still crouched on the ground, and extend its head to lunge at you up to two times in a row with reaching claw swipes. \n\n\n\nHowever, when you see the Centipede Guai stand up on its two legs, back off your attack immediately. It will start spewing poison down below its body as it staggers around, hoping to catch you unaware. \n\nOften times when it returns to crawl on the ground, it will take a few moments to pause and groom itself, giving you a huge window to attack, just watch your spacing or use a Pillar Stance to get out of the poison goo on the ground. \n\n\n\nOne if its big main attacks can look scary at first until you understand the movement, and will start when it stands up but begins to crouch its body. The Centipede will roll into a ball and charge at you with alarming speed, and even bounce off walls to come back to hit you a second time. \n\n\n\nWhile it does move fast, it's also extremely susceptible to a well-timed Rock Solid Deflection, and when done at the right time, will topple it to the ground. Use this period to unleash your focus points for a big hit, and it will struggle to rise and give you more time to Immobilize it and keep it vulnerable to more damage. \n\nBe sure to stay on guard when it finally does rise, as it can easily feint into a backward slam with its armored hide. \n\n\n\nAt lower health, it may also curl into a ball but fly up into the air to slam down while still curled up. Be wary when trying to counter this move, as it will start to squirm around before unraveling into a quick two-hit claw swipe as it reorients itself. \n\nThe one last trick it has up its sleeve will occur after losing half its health. When it starts to emit a large screeching roar, break off your attack and start running in the opposite direction. \n\n\n\nDozens of smaller centipedes will roll over the nearby ledge and into the arena to chase you on multiple fronts, and explode on impact. \n\n\n\nThe best thing you can do is let them chase you by sprinting in the opposite direction, and then swerve to the side to make them all collide with each other and explode. Just be sure not to take too long, or the Centipede Guai will soon join the fray and ram you at much faster speeds. \n\nAside from that, there's not too many other moves the Centipede Guai is capable of, so focus on dodging its backward slam, and saving your deflections for when it tries to roll into you, and you'll have no problem finding plenty of time to get your big hits in. \n\nWhen the Centipede Guai falls, you'll be able to gain its Centipede Guai Spirit along with a Knot of Voidness and Gold Tree Core. \n\nCentipede Guai",
