    "content": "The Apramana Bat is a massive golden bat that is quite troublesome to fight. This boss frequently launches itself up into the air, crashing back down on you to deal massive damage. It also has an air slice attack where it beats its wings, creating blades of air that rocket toward you. \n\nCasting immobilize on the Apramana Bat when it's grounded is a good way to get enough time to land some hits before it leaps into the air again, but make sure you don't cast it too early. If you freeze the Apramana Bat in the air, you might not be able to reach it with your attacks.",
