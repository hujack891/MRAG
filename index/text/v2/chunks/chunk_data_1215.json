As with other bosses in this realm, poison can be a big factor in the fight, so it's worth crafting extra Antimiasma Pills, and equipping poison resistant gear, curios, and Gourd soaks to help out where possible. \n\nWhen you're ready to face the mother of spiders, head through into the large cave opening to face the Lady of the Webbed Hollow. You'll learn more about her tragic life during the adventures of Wukong as she speaks with Zhu Bajie, and once you interrupt the scene, you'll need to prepare for battle.",
