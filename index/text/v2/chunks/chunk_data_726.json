Cultivate your best Spirits, make sure you have a lot of pills on hand an craft a bunch of extra Shock-Quelling Powder (you're going to need it). \n\nYou should also have any anti-shock gear/curios/soaks on hand as well, along with whatever else can keep you alive for awhile. This final encounter is spread out into three distinct fights, and while you'll be able to respawn and pick up where you left off for the first two sections from the Shrine, the final section won't take you back to the Shrine. \n\nWhen you're ready to take on the lord of New Thunderclap Temple, head through the door.",
