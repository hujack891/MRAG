    "content": "The Fungiwoman fight is rather difficult, thanks to her unique skills. To begin with, she has a poisonous staff that she will use to smack you. She can also spin around with the staff at very high speeds, creating a swirling vortex of pain that flings you across the battlefield if you get hit by it. She gets dizzy after this attack, giving you a good opportunity to counter with an attack of your own. \n\nThis is bad enough already, but she also has an attack where she shoots spores out over the arena that target and hurt you. These spores replenish the Fungiwoman's health. The trick here is to fight aggressively so she doesn't have time to replenish much HP. Otherwise, it can drag on for a very long time.",
