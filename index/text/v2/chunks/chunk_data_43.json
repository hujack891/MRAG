Inside, you’ll find a friendly Horse Guai. \n\n\n\nThe whip-wielding warrior will offer some interesting insight about the Black Wind King that rules over this mountain, and the greed and lies that have infected him and his people. While you’re here, you can interact with a small pillow in the middle of the cave to rest at a new **Meditation Spot** in front of the altar, granting you a new Skill Point. \n\nThe Cavern, Bamboo Grove Meditation Spot\n\nBack outside, continue on the main path taking out the three lesser wolves and harvesting Jade Lotus from the pond and Gentian on to the right of the path. \n\n\n\nLook for some broken fencing path the plants on the right and you’ll find a new type of Wolf, the Wolf Sentinel, who uses a small halberd for quick slicing attacks. Dodge around them and his final jump attack before unleashing a charged attack of your own, and then loot the large wooden chest he was guarding to grab 270 **Will** and 2 **Stone Spirit**. \n\nContinue along the main narrow path and down some stairs until you see a large slab with a mural on it. Just to the right is a small alcove that holds a Snake-Head Mushroom you can harvest. \n\n\n\nAhead of you is the base of some small falls where a few Croaky frog Guai are waiting among some Jade Lotus, and a green wisp with a few Will to grab at. Another wisp can be found below the opposite falls, by starting to head up the stone stairs on the side and looking left for a small canyon. \n\n\n\nTo advance, keep heading up the stairway to cross the high bridge over the falls, where you’ll soon see the golden trail of a nearby shrine beckoning you left. Before making that turn, be sure to look to the right to find a small wooden gazebo with a small table, and open the small gold box on top to find a variety of medicines, including 2 **Tiger Subduing Pellets** , 1 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 1 **Amplification Pellet**.",
