    "content": "The Commander Beetle would be a fairly straightforward miniboss fight, if not for the six Sword Daoists he's currently training in the large courtyard where you'll find him just past the Forest of Ferocity. Unfortunately, these enemies will respawn until you defeat the Commander, so you won't be able to get him alone so easily. \n\n\n\nKnowing that the Daoists don't have a whole lot of heath, there are two things you have on your side: large area-of-effect Spirit Attacks, and your Pluck of Many Spell. The Pluck of Many is a great bet for disorienting the group as you attack, though results can vary, and you'll likely have to jump in an finish off a few Daoists yourself.

He can employ huge strikes that cleave the very ground in a line where he strikes, and if you aren't paying attention, you can usually get hit by the tremors before you know what's going on. \n\nTry to keep in view as much as possible while defeating the Daoists so you can prepare to dodge away from his moves. \n\n\n\nOnce it's down to a 1v1 fight, you'll find things a bit more approachable, though you should still be on guard. For all his talk of wanting to die, he's a very competent swordfighter, and uses his blades in a few distinct ways. \n\n\n\nHe can quickly charge at you in a lunging backhanded slice attack, which will result in a whirlwind of blade strikes all around him after a moment you'll also need to dodge. \n\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Commander Beetle can also perform of series of sword slams with his bigger left sword. The small line that extends from his strike won't look like much for a moment, until a large fissure erupts from the path of his weapon which he can do several times in a row. \n\n\n\nEven when not slamming the ground, his bigger sword can also cut through the air to send a slicing wave of force at you from a distance, which comes out much faster than his slams, and can be done multiple times. \n\n\n\nHowever, if he decides to hold his left weapon up by his face in a reverse grip fashion, it will become his shield, and he'll be able to soak any blows you try and land on him (even when Immobilized).

Luckily, you can counter his counter with a well-timed Rock Solid to throw him off. \n\n\n\nAlong with a variety of lunging attacks and dual-wield slashes, he also has a few unorthodox moves. If he tries to headbutt you by leaping on his side, resist the impulses to kick him when he's down.
