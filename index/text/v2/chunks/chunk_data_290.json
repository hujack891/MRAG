The Soak's ability is rather specialised, useful for specific spell builds or when adopting a particular style, over some of the other Soaks, which have a more general use. \n\nWith the Copper Pill Soak equipped, after using the gourd, the next Rock Solid cast costs no mana for a short duration. If you are using the Rock Solid spell, then this can be an incredibly useful addition to your build, giving you free uses of the spell, without needing to refill your mana as much. However, if you are not using the spell, then other Soaks will be more worthwhile. \n\n\n\nSoaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get to Rock Solid will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor",
