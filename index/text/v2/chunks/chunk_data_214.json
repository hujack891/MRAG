Head straight to the back of the area from the shrine to find a small breakable wooden fence protected by a Spearbone enemy. \n\n\n\nIn this large open field, you’ll find a friendly boar-like Guai resting on a rock. He’s apparently extremely inebriated, and needs you to help him find something to sober him up. He’ll mention “Windrest” if you talk to him again, providing a clue to where you can find such an ingredient. \n\nThere are two ways to get the item required: \n\n\n\n  * If you complete the Man-in-Stone’s questline, you’ll find that the Man-in-Stone sells a **Sobering Stone** if you don’t want to explore.\n\n\n\n  * To locate the stone itself, you’ll need to head through the Yellow Wind Formation to the Windrest Hamlet, which is across the Windrest Bridge up the road past the Crouching Tiger Temple. Once you enter the hamlet, take a left to find a large building guarded by a Rat Soldier and Rat Imperial Guard. On the left side when looking at the large building, defeat a Blazebone monster, and then look to the right for a small alcove, where you can spot a glowing pot. Break the pot, and you’ll find the **Sobering Stone**.\n\n\n\nWhen you return it to the Drunken Boar, he’ll thank you, and declare that he’s now off in search of a meaty meal. He doesn’t actually want you to get some for him, and will set off himself to the Crouching Tiger Temple. \n\n\n\nAt the temple entrance, start to head up the stairs, and then turn right before the top — opposite where the Meditation Spot is. You’ll find the Boar resting against a far wall under one of the giant tiger sculptures.He’ll complain of the poor meat quality, and instead ask that you bring him a **Jade Lotus**. If you don’t already have plenty gathered, you’ll find Jade Lotus to harvest in most ponds and bodies of water, like the one right at the start of the chapter. \n\n\n\nWhen you give the Boar the Jade Lotus, he’ll relay some interesting information about a “Realm of Gold” that he’s seeking. Apparently he spoke to one of the rats, who said “our senior brother gave me a piece of gold. I’ll need it here when the time’s right.” He’ll then proclaim that the time is right, and will leave the temple. \n\n\n\nThis “senior brother” is the First Prince of Flowing Sand — aka the giant rat Yaoguai Chief that you can fight in the Valley of Despair on the road from Sandgate Village to the Crouching Tiger Temple. If you didn’t kill the rat king, he’ll summon the prince to fight you. Otherwise, you can use the Pungent Flesh Chunk to summon and defeat him yourself. He’ll drop the Arhat Gold Piece when defeated, which is the gold the Boar needs. \n\n\n\nThe Boar will actually return to near where you first met him at the Rockrest Flat area of the Fright Cliff. However, instead of sitting on a rock, he’ll now be standing over by the stairs leading to a large door you can’t access yet. \n\nUnfortunately, he’s not too pleased that you’re in possession of the gold, and will challenge you to a duel. Upon defeat, he’ll relent and offer to let you join him in exploring the Realm of Gold together, before vanishing off behind the giant gate up the stairs. \n\n\n\nOnce you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into the Kingdom of Sahali",
