    "content": "The Father of Stones is a unique enemy that relies on his massive body to deal damage. His most common attacks are stomps and spin attacks, where he flings the top half of his body around in a circle. You can also expect to see belly flops and a loud roar attack that deals damage and sends you flying if you are too close. The Father of Stones has a long tongue that he can whip you with, almost like the frog bosses, although it's not quite as powerful as theirs. \n\nThe Father of Stones hits hard but is also rather slow. Stick to his back and press the dodge button to recover quickly when flung backward from his roar.",
