A singular path will lie on the outdoor ring that you can progress across. \n\n\n\nIf you defeated Captain Lotus-Vision, the first locked cell you encounter on the left will now be unlocked, allowing you to open and loot the **Treasure Chest** within for various materials. Just beware of a much larger Swift Bat hiding above the chest. \n\n\n\nUp ahead, watch out for an ambushing Frozen Corpse before you reach another long wooden plank that you'll need to cross. You may also run into another Lantern Sentry on this section of the walkway, so be sure to take him out as well. \n\n\n\nThis plank will be even harder to cross than the first, as you'll have to not only deal with a Yaksha Archer on a small platform halfway across, but a second archer in an open cell window on the left, and another near the end of the wooden plank. Worse still -- there's a Cyan Bat hiding above the archer halfway across the plank who will divebomb you if you attempt to fight that archer, and likely send you toppling down to the level below to die from fall damage. \n\nIf you survive the fall, make sure to use the Incense Trail Talisman to quickly warp back to the Shrine instead of having to make the climb yet again. \n\nThere are a few strategies to try if you're having trouble here. Since trying to move while staff-spinning will just send you over the edge, you should instead try to use Cloud Step to evade their arrows and try to kill the archer on the platform quickly (he won't respawn) and then run from the Cyan Bat. \n\n\n\nYou can also try launching yourself to the archer in the window, by jumping and using a midair heavy attack to give yourself a boost over to the window... but do note that he's not alone. \n\n\n\nHowever you get across, you can find an entrance into the cell tunnel leading to where the archer was stationed, and encounter a Red-Haired Yaksha guarding a green Wisp to absorb, which is helpful for getting back some of your healing gourd after the fight. \n\n\n\nFurther up the cell tunnel, you may notice a Snake-Head Mushroom glowing blue... that can't be right. Try to harvest it, and you'll uncover an extremely strong Fungiman enemy. \n\n\n\nHe's much stronger than any plant Guai you've encountered, and summons poison pools all around him. He can also shoot out several poison projectiles at you from all sides, and stab the ground repeatedly to cause poison explosions. \n\n\n\nWatch out for his extended spinning attack with his weapon, and wait for him to get dizzy before launching a counter attack and Immobilizing him to extend his downtime. If he floats into the air, be ready for him to crash his weapon into the ground as he lands. \n\nWhen defeated, you'll earn his Fungiman Spirit to add to your collection. Not far past where the Fungiman was hiding you can spot the stairway up to Level 4, but there's a bit more to explore here first. \n\n\n\nBack on the outside ring, you may notice two more Lantern Sentries patrolling when the beguiling chant is active, so it's a good idea to take them down whenever the chanting begins. \n\n\n\nIf you keep heading past the two sentries, you'll find a few more open cells that have Snake-Head Mushrooms and a glowing green Wisp to absorb. The third cell has a purple seal on it -- unless you already defeated the Yaoguai Chief Captain -- in which case you can open it to grab a second green Wisp guarded by a Withered Corpse. \n\n\n\nAt the far end of this path past another open cell with a green Wisp, the walkway will have crumbled before you can reach the last green Wisp, but there's a side passage into an open cell. (a Lantern Sentry will also appear walking out of this cell when the chanting is active!) \n\n\n\nThe cell beyond will require you to have beaten Captain Lotus-Vision to unlock, and holds a **Treasure Chest** with materials in addition to the Wisp on the ledge, guarded by another Red-Haired Yaksha.",
