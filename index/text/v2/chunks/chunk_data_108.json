Due to the low visibility ahead, let the creature come to you and dodge its twinblade attacks before hitting with a charged strike. \n\nHead further into the tunnel until it opens up with more light, and you’ll find a very large wooden balcony ahead, as the main path curves to the right. \n\n\n\nBe sure to head out onto the balcony, as you’ll find the third and final **Meditation Spot** in Black Wind Mountain, earning you another free Spark Skill Point. \n\nThe Cliff, Black Wind Cave Meditation Spot\n\nNext to the Meditation Spot, you can also find a small golden pot that holds a **Celestial Taiyi Pill** , which will greatly increase your maximum mana like the other pill did for your health. \n\nBlack Wind Mountain Celestial Taiyi Pill\n\n\n\nReturn to the path and take the stairs up to fight against another Wolf Assassin as the cave grows dark, and draw them into the light if needed. \n\nAs you reach an open part of the cave, you’ll have to face one more assassin along the darkened path, and you may notice they’ll go out of their way to destroy the torches along the path to further envelop them in darkness. If you have trouble facing them, always try to bring them to a brighter spot.",
