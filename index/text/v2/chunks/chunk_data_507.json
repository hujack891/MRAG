    "content": "The fight against Gore-Eye Daoist is a rather difficult one. Here are the kind of moves you can expect to see: \n\n  * Staff Slam\n  * Poison Projectiles\n  * Blood Wave\n  * Shock Wave\n\nThe Gore-Eye Daoist is a disturbing enemy with a large, bulbous tumor attached to his back that is covered in eyeballs. He mainly fights with his staff, which he uses as a blunt weapon. It also spews out large amounts of poisonous blood-red liquid over the battlefield. The blood makes the arena difficult to traverse, as any contact with the glowing center of the substance raises your poison meter. \n\nThe Gore-Eye Daoist can also shoot solidified shards of blood at you from its many eyeballs, inflicting poison damage on impact. In addition to that, there is another staff slam move that the Gore-Eye Daoist does that releases a shock wave over the arena. There is a lot to contend with here. Take some Antimiasma Powder before you head into the fight, and don't skimp on your Immobilize or A Pluck of Many spells.",
