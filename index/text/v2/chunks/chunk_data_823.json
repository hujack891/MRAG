    "content": "The Qian-Tian Gourd is the most unique Gourd in Black Myth: Wukong, with an ability unlike any of the other Gourds. It's strength and one-of-a-kind nature mean it can't be upgraded at all at the Shen Monkey Vendor. \n\nWith the Gourd equipped, using it will cause your Gourd uses to slowly recover. However, the catch is you only have one use of the Qing-Tian Gourd, so you will have to wait for each charge to recover after use. This makes it entirely unique when compared to everything else in the game.",
