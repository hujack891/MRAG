Note that you can still freely fast travel back to any Shrine in Chapter 1’s Black Wind Mountain if you missed out on any secrets. The store is also selling very different items than it was in the previous chapter, and you’ll find that the selection will change based on which chapter you are in: \n\nYellow Wind Ridge Shrine Shop   \n---  \nAntimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |   \nMind Core (x2) - 720 Will | Silk (x2) - 600 Will | Yaoguai Core (x2) - 450 Will |   \nLicorice (x5) - 120 Will | Aged Ginseng (x5) - 90 Will | Fragrant Jade Flower (x5) - 120 Will | Purple Lingzhi (x5) - 90 Will   \nFire Bellflower (x5) - 120 Will | Jade Lotus (x5) - 90 Will | |   \n  \n\n\nIn addition, you’ll also have access to crafting a new set of armor since defeating the Black Wind King: The Ebongold Set, which provides better defense and a few bonuses to using your Cloud Step. Also, with the Flame Ebongold from the boss himself, you can use it and other ingredients to craft the Wind Bear Staff! \n\n\n\nBefore heading into the village, it’s time to finally find a use for all those plant materials you’ve been gathering. Look just beyond the shrine for a small ditch running under a wooden bridge. You can explore the left side to find a sloping path up to a green Wisp to absorb, and where a mushroom is actually a Lingzhiling creature in disguise. Watch for its poisonous attacks, and kill it to earn a large variety of mushroom items. The ditch also leads below the town’s large gate, but aside from Fragrant Jade Flower to harvest, there’s not much else down here. \n\n\n\nFollow the ditch through the opposite path under the bridge, and head right to a tunnel. Inside, apart from a green Wisp you can absorb for some Will and a mushroom to harvest, you can spot a grubby yet friendly canine deity. \n\n\n\nThe Xu Dog as he’s known has a problem he needs help with: A large frog has swallowed one of his medicinal formulas, and you’re just the person he’s looking for to get it back.",
