In addition to the swipes and poison damage, however, the Old Ginseng Guai has one other unique move up his sleeve. At multiple points throughout the battle, Old Ginseng Guai will thrust his hands into the ground, spreading roots over the battlefield. When he pulls his arms back out, several other Ginsenling enemies will rise from the ground as well.",
