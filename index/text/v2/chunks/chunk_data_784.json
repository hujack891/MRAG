Many Frozen Corpses are scattered around this area can be tough to pick out as you advance, so move cautiously. \n\n\n\nBe sure to check the right corner first to find Tree Pearls to harvest, and a floating green Wisp in the left corner to absorb. \n\nMaking your way up the snowfield, the winds will die down as the giant titular pagoda of this realm appears to loom up in front of you. This may seem like the main path to advance, but in reality it's more of a teaser. \n\n\n\nYou'll find a large empty field up the slope, leading to a shrouded gate of fog that lets you enter The Great Pagoda. Inside, you can activate a Shrine, but you'll find there's no one in this grand room. \n\n\n\nWhat you will find are two large murals on the first two walls on the left, and looking closely you should be able to recognize them -- they are the scenes depicted to you after completing the previous chapters! With that in mind, you'll want to come back here after getting close to completing the game, once all the scenes have been unlocked in this room, but for now, head back to the Snow-Veiled Trail Shrine. \n\n\n\nHead up the slope full of Frozen Corpses to the large forested area full of rocks. A golden trail will soon appear leading straight ahead and up a broken stairway to the Warding Temple on the hill, but there's an optional area to consider first off to the left. \n\n\n\nExploring this large rock-filled forest, you'll find a lot of Frozen Corpses that will come to lift, and more than a few plants to harvest as well. \n\n\n\nThe further back you get, the more enemies you'll encounter, including a strange new aggressive plant that can spin in place or shoot poison projectiles at you. Defeat this Golden Lotus Guai for a good chance to earn a Golden Lotus. You can also encounter a lone Yaksha Patroller in the middle of the field. \n\n\n\nAs you head up the right side of this field just past where the Yaksha Patroller was, be ready for another Falcon enemy to swoop down between two small gnarled trees. Like the one at the top of the Mani Wheel, he'll attack at range with projectile slices, divebomb you with forward spins, or create tornado gusts to keep you at bay. \n\n\n\nAnother Falcon Guai will appear not far up on the left side between two much larger trees, but apart from these enemies the rest of this sloping forest is largely devoid of enemies. Be sure to check behind the trees where he appeared to absorb another green Wisp. \n\nYou can find a path continuing at the top of the slope off to the right, past another Golden Lotus Guai. \n\n\n\nWhen the path turns into a large valley, another Falcon Guai will appear, only this one is empowered by the Spirit within. You'll need to attack cautiously against this stronger foe, using Spirit attacks to stagger him, and Cloud Step to sidestep his gusts to flank him from the sides. Defeat him, and you'll gain the Falcon Hermit Spirit. \n\n\n\nHead through the rest of the valley and deal with a Yaksha Patroller, which will lead to another rope bridge leading to a higher ledge. \n\n\n\nUp ahead, you'll find a large stone obelisk with a **Treasure Chest** at its base, which is unfortunately guarded by another strong Abomination with its twin tentacle appendages. Time your attack carefully to avoid its high damage strikes, and then loot the chest to gain some valuable items, which should include a Knot of Voidness and Blood of the Iron Bull. \n\n\n\nThe rest of the path leads right back along a ridge that overlooks the forest you ventured through earlier (as well as some Celestial Pears you can harvest), and eventually over to the side of the Warding Temple that you can drop down to reach the Shrine. \n\n\n\nBefore you head in, be sure to explore the bottom of the stairway for a small narrow path beyond. Check to the left of a small tunnel to find another Abomination guarding a **Treasure Chest** with materials, then head through (watching out for a Cyan Bat lurking above) to reach a dead end cliff overlooking the Grand Pagoda in the distance, and check the left side of the cliff to grab a green Wisp guarded by a Frozen Corpse.",
