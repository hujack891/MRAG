The Soak's ability is rather specialised, useful for specific spell builds or when adopting a particular style, over some of the other Soaks, which are better for general use. \n\nWith the Iron Pellet Soak equipped, using the gourd can no longer be interrupted by incoming attacks. Additionally, using the Gourd with the Soak provides considerable damage reduction. \n\nSoaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor.",
