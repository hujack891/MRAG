To defeat him while taking minimal damage, keep your distance and wait for him to charge at you with his shield. Wait until he is right in front of you with his shield raised and dodge to the side. Turn around quickly, run to Spearbone, and land a combo on his back before he turns back around. Repeat this process until he is bested.",
