Unfortunately, though, summoning the Mother of Flamlings also summons several other Flamlings who will hurl fireballs at you throughout the entire fight. \n\nMake your way around the arena, picking off the Flamlings so you can focus on the Mother. Continue dodging around the Mother while slashing away to wear down her HP bar and eventually defeat the Mother of Flamlings. If you're struggling with this battle, some Body-Cooling Powder will help with any Burn Damage you might be incurring.",
