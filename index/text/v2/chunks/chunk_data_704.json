You'll encounter some more of the Searing and Scorching-Flame enemies, as well as a little green Wisp to the right, by the lava lake. \n\n\n\nAs you head into the next barren section, you may notice the glow of a treasure chest up ahead. Be warned that there are also little glowing patches leading up to, and inside the next clearing, and these are all Flamlings. Clear them out before you go over to the chest, where you can collect Refined Iron Sand from it. \n\nWhen you've looted the chest, go around to the other side of the rock. There will be an open clearing here, that looks like it's empty. Again, remove any Flamlings from the area, then go to the center of the clearing. Here you'll find a larger glowing patch. \n\n\n\nThis is actually where you can summon a miniboss called the Mother of Flamlings, and to do so, all you need to give over is 4x Flame Ores. Thankfully, Flame Ores are dropped by Flamlings, so you'll hopefully have enough by this point to summon her immediately. Approach the glowing patch and deliver the Flame Ores.",
