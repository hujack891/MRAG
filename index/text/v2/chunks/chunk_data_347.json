    "content": "Ebon Flow is one of the Transformation Spells you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Focused on dodging and deflecting attacks to then follow those actions up with powerful attacks, Ebon Flow can easily be missed within The New West as it is a part of a long quest chain. \n\nThe spell allows you to transform into the Yin Tiger to ward off incoming blows by holding the sword horizontally, or dashing forward like a gale to close in on foes. Focus is then built up before transformation can be converted for use afterward. Ebon Flow's moveset is as follows: \n\n  * **Light attack: Onslaught Blade - Raise the Great Iron Blade to strike the target, building up focus with each hit.** As Focus increases, enemies are more easily staggered with this series of attacks that raises your Great Iron Blade.\n  * **Heavy attack: Rift Cleaver - Hold Heavy Attack to unleash a powerful cleave, deling massive damage.** The more Focus built up, the more devastating the damage becomes with this attack, which is a slow, powerful slam. \n  * **Deflection: Blacksmith - Raise the blade to deflect assaults, build up Focus with each deflection, or dodge to switch to other moves.** This is one of the only defensive moves a Transformation Spell has, building Focus with each hit and allowing you to mitigate damage.",
