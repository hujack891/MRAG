To begin the Mad Tiger quest, you must first defeat the Tiger's Acolyte and collect his Spirit along with an item called the Old Rattle Drum. \n\n\n\nYou will need to find three areas across Yellow Wind Ridge where you can use the drum to summon a spirit. The only clue you’ll have is that entering the correct area will cause your vision to warp, and you will hear the ghostly voice of a boy calling out to you. \n\n\n\n  * The first location is further back in the Windrest Hamlet. Return across the bridge to the Windrest Hamlet Shrine and pass back through the large gate, immediately taking a left to the large house surrounded by sitting Withering Corpses. \n\n\n\n  * The second location is on the path down from the sealed stone door where you fought the King of Flowing Sand and the Second Rat Prince. Head down from the door towards a bridge and take a right to pass through a ruined building overhang where there’s a long roof-like walkway and several Withering Corpses milling about.\n\n\n\n  * The final location is back in the area where you fought the Earth Wolf and rescued the Horse Guai who was tied up by the large statue in Sandgate Village. Look to the left of that statue altar, and you’ll find a small field around the back with a concerning amount of skeletons and a well. \n\n\n\nUsing the Rattle-Drum here one final time will cause the spirit of the boy to appear before you, and invite you to hop down the well to meet a “friend”. Unfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there.",
