Once you first enter the region, head along the main path across the pond and left along a ridge to reach the **Village Entrance Shrine**. \n\n\n\nLook just beyond the shrine for a small ditch running under a wooden bridge. Follow the ditch through the opposite path under the bridge, and head right to a tunnel. Inside, apart from a green Wisp you can absorb for some Will and a mushroom to harvest, you can spot a grubby yet friendly canine deity. \n\n\n\nThe Xu Dog has a problem he needs help with: A **large frog** has swallowed one of his medicinal formulas, and you’re just the person he’s looking for to get it back. You’ll find the frog miniboss Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw nearby in a large pit, and it can employ electrical attacks to defend itself. \n\n\n\nOnce you defeat this frog boss, he’ll drop the **Evil Repelling Medicament formula**. Return it to the Xu dog back outside the pit. Not only will he reward you with **2 Evil Repelling Medicament** for your trouble, but you’ll also unlock the ability to **create all sorts of consumables yourself** at any Shrine. With all the materials you’ve been harvesting, you can stock up on defensive, offensive, and status reducing consumables.",
