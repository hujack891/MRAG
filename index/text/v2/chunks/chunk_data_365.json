With these conditions, you'll automatically unlock the bad ending after the final boss fight in Chapter 6. \n\n\n\nWhen you've beaten The Great Sage's Broken Shell, you'll see Wukong collapse in the water and the six senses leave its body. \n\n\n\nThese will be absorbed by The Destined One, who will kneel down face to face with Wukong. Despite obtaining all the Great Sage's Six Senses, and besting Wukong, a crown falls into the water. \n\n\n\nAs The Old Monkey collects the golden crown from the water, he places it on top of The Destined One's head. Unfortunately, this does nothing but place The Destined One inside the same rock that Wukong laid waiting.",
