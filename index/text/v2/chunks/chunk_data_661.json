The last one, the A Thousand Days Inebriation, is purchased from the Shen Monkey Vendor. \n\nWith the Loong Balm equipped, each sip of your Gourds recovers 30% of Maximum Health. At the same time, each sip considerably increases damage executed by the next attack. This makes the Drink one of the most powerful, especially if you can pair it with a strong Soak and Gourd too. \n\nAs with all Drinks, the potency of the Loong Balm can be increased by finding the Awoken Wine Worm locations. Our page has all of their locations for you. \n\nYou can then use these special Crafting Materials to upgrade the Drink at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove within Black Wind Mountain. Each upgrade will provide a buff to your healing potential and the additional effect. But, as you level the Drink up, more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed. \n\nThis carries over to New Game Plus too, as you can upgrade your Drinks even more, but once again more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed, so you will have to recollect them all in your New Game Plus run.",
