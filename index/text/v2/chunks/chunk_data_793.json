    "content": "Pinebrew is one of the Drinks in Black Myth: Wukong that you can find in the latter half of the game. Located after The New West, it has one of the more unique effects out of the entire collection of Drinks available. \n\nWith the Pinebrew Drink equipped, each sip of your Gourd will recover 35% of maximum health. Additionally, when your health is below half, using the gourd will grant you a considerable amount of Focus, key to performing some of the more powerful heavy attacks in the game with your weapon or as one of the Transformation Spells. \n\nLike all the Drinks in the game, the potency of this effect can be increased by finding the Awoken Wine Worm locations around the game's six areas. Our page has all of their locations for you. \n\nYou can then use these special Crafting Materials to upgrade the Drinks in your collection at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove within Black Wind Mountain. Each upgrade will provide a sizeable buff to your healing potential, as well as any additional buffs. But as you level the Drink up, more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed. \n\nThis carries over to New Game Plus too, as you can upgrade your Drinks even more, but once again more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed, so you will have to recollect them all in your New Game Plus run.",
