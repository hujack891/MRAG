This is an excellent move to pull out if you're getting overwhelmed and need a bit of space on the battlefield but also want to deal some damage while you're getting it. \n\nThe equipped effect is an all-or-nothing sort of deal that isn't for the faint of heart. It moderately increases your Attack at the expense of a massive chunk of your Health. This effect is situational, and its success depends on your ability to avoid damage. Thankfully, you will have had plenty of practice with Perfect Dodging after defeating the Mad Tiger. \n\nCheck out our other helpful Black Myth: Wukong guides! \n\n  * How-To Guides\")\n  * Key Items\n  * Walkthrough",
