    "content": "The Scorpion Prince is a large enemy whose main method of attack is its giant, poisonous, barbed tail. The Scorpion Prince uses its tail to sweep you out from under your feet, stab you, and poison you. Some of these moves involve the Scorpion leaping into the air first and crashing its tail back down as it lands. The Scorpion Prince is a big enemy, and it hits hard, too, so you definitely want to keep an eye on its tail during the fight. \n\nYou will most likely get poisoned during the battle, so you might want to take some Antimiasma Powder with you to cure you if your health gets dangerously low.",
