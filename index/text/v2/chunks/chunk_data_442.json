Below you'll find a guide for the Fright Cliff Region and its side quests for the Man-in-Stone and Yellow-Robed Squire, as well as how to defeat its many bosses that include the Mother of Stones and Stone Vanguard to get the Sterness of Stone. \n\n  * **Jump to A Section:**\n  * **Squall Hideout**\n    * Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Stones\n  * **Rockrest Flat**\n    * Yaoguai King - Stone Vanguard\n  * **Rock Crash Platform**\n\n\n\nFright Cliff is one of the two sub-regions you’ll need to explore in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong in order to unlock the large sealed doors that lead to the end of the chapter. You can first reach this area by heading through the Sandgate Village and defeating the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, and then crossing the bridge to the right of the sealed door. \n\n\n\nAs you cross the bridge, you can harvest some Licorice on the other side, and look to the left to spot a large archway in the distance, with a whirling black tornado even further left in a canyon separating the Fright Cliffs from the Crouching Tiger Temple. \n\n\n\nHeading toward the archway in the distance, you can find a green Wisp to absorb on the left side of the broken rock pathway, and on the right is a new type of enemy that will try to ambush you. This Pitstone is a mass of rock and skulls on legs, and will try to use its weight to jump down on you, and perform somersaults to use its momentum to slam into you. If they prove to be a problem to evade, consider using the Thrust Stance to charge up attacks from a distance and shatter them. \n\n\n\nAt the foot of the large archway stands another new enemy, the Spearbone. These warriors with horse skull heads adorned with brambles are very durable enemies, and will roar before stabbing and slashing with their hefty spears. Since they are slow to hit, engage in light attack combos and watch their moments to know when to dodge or try a strike through. \n\n\n\nAs you enter the Fright Cliff proper, another Pitstone enemy waits up the path, with a Blazebone enemy on a ledge to the right to try and pepper you with projectiles. \n\n\n\nMake sure not to lock on and face the smaller threat, or you’ll be rammed by the Pitstone. Instead use your Cloud Step to get around and sneak attack.",
