There's also a green Wisp just outside on the ledge. \n\n\n\nStepping outside, you can see a long path down the left leading up and out of the prison at the far end, but walking the path is another tough Red-Haired Yaksha to deal with first. \n\nBe wary of ambushes from Frozen Corpses that will try to hamper your battles with the Red-Haired Yaksha, and engage them cautiously when you feel like you have the upper hand. Once he's out of the way, grab the green Wisp and then head up the broken wooden ramp. \n\n\n\nAfter you defeat the lone archer guarding the ramp up out of the prison, you may notice any current curse applied to you will dissipate the moment you reach the top! You can celebrate this breath of fresh air, just be wary of a Frozen Corpse waiting to try and attack you as you cross the last wooden beam. \n\n\n\nTo the left, you can find the Mani Wheel Shrine and a path to the boss, but there's one last section of the fourth level of the prison we need to complete, which unfortunately means going back to the madness. Be sure to unlock the Shrine regardless so you can teleport back to it easily. \n\nTake the path going right from the wooden beams, and you'll come upon a group of frozen corpses by a raised platform. They'll be smashed to pieces as a new enemy flies down -- a Falcon Fan-Maker. \n\n\n\nThis enemy is built fairly tough, and can launch themselves high up to slice the air with their fan to create projectiles to slash your way. \n\nWhen he descends back to the ground, use Immobilize to keep him pinned down as you press the attack, and use Spirit attacks to keep him staggered. Be ready for him to flap his wings to push your back or create whirlwinds as he flies up. \n\nThe Falcon man can also use a slow two-handed overhand swing in melee range, or at a distance to create giant tornadoes hurtling your way. \n\n\n\nHis most dangerous attack is a repeated spinning divebomb attack he can perform repeatedly to dash at you from all angles. Once you get the timing down, a Rock Solid deflection can stop him cold, or you can Cloud Step to the side and retaliate as he flies past. \n\n\n\nOnce defeated, look to the right past where he appeared to find a broken walkway with several rock platforms you can carefully drop down to find the other side of the pagoda's Level 4 walkway. \n\n\n\nHead up the path where you'll find one more Red-Haired Yaksha patrolling, and lure him away from the enemies at the end of the path to take him on alone. \n\n\n\nPast where the Yaksha was patrolling, you should find two cells. One is already open, and holds a green Wisp inside near a Frozen Corpse keep traveling down this cell tunnel past an Abomination, and you can find a **Treasure Chest** with some materials inside. \n\n\n\nNext door, you can find the final sealed cell, which you can now open if you defeated Captain Lotus-Vision. Inside is another **Treasure Chest** that has more random materials, but it's guarded by an Enslaved Yaksha. \n\nPast that last cell door, there's a big open area with a few final important things to do: \n\n\n\nFirst, look for a Blade Monk surrounded by frozen corpses, and note his blue glow. He's a lot more durable than the others, but by taking him on patiently and using your cooldowns, you'll be able to defeat him and gain the **Blade Monk Spirit**. \n\nJust past where the was stationed, you can spot a glowing pot in the corner. Break it open to gain a new **Awaken Wine Worm** , and be sure to travel back to the Shen Monkey to upgrade your Gourd (and make sure you grabbed the new items he sells!). \n\nOutside the Pagona Awaken Wine Worm\n\n\n\nFinally, wait until the distressing chants begin and curse you one last time, and a final Lantern Sentry on this level will appear nearby. If you defeat him (and have defeated all the other Lantern Sentries in the Pagoda Realm), he'll drop the **Auspicious Lantern Curio** , which allows you to trigger the \"chant-beguiling\" effect of this prison at will when using Cloud Step.",
