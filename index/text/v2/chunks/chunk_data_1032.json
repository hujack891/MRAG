    "content": "Sunset of the Nine Skies is one of the Drinks in Black Myth: Wukong. It is one of the trickier ones to find, located towards the end of The Webbed Hollow. \n\nWith the Sunset of the Nine Skies Drink equipped to your Gourds, each sip recovers 35% of maximum health. Additionally, each sip grants a considerable amount of Qi - which is a nice bonus on top of the basic healing. \n\nAs with all Drinks, the potency of it can be increased by finding the Awoken Wine Worm locations around the game's areas. Our page has each location for you. \n\nYou can then use these Crafting Materials to upgrade the Drink at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove within Black Wind Mountain. Each upgrade will provide a sizeable buff to your healing potential. As you level the Drink up, more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed to further upgrade it. \n\nThis carries over to New Game Plus too, as you can upgrade your Drinks even more, but once again more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed, so you will have to recollect them all in your New Game Plus run.",
