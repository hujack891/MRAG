Always wait until the third attack lands before trying to counter, and use your Spirit Attack when you know you have room to land the hit. \n\n\n\nBe on your guard whenever you try to attack him head on, as his favorite attack at close range is taking a quick swig of his own gourd before breathing flames in front of him. A quick dodge can put you behind him, allowing you to continue your light attack combo as he finishes spraying the area in front of him. \n\n\n\nIf you see him raise one foot up, quickly Immobilize or dash to the side, as he’ll try to stagger you with a quick kick, and then race forward with his spear to keep charging into you for multiple hits that’s nearly impossible to get out of once he starts. \n\n\n\nHis most frustrating attack will come when he transforms into the Black Wind itself, becoming a wisp-like thing that floats around the arena. You’ll need to look carefully for the small “bursts” emanating from the wisp that denote its charge attack straight at you, and can happen in two quick dashes back and forth. \n\n\n\nOnce you see the wisp fly up, retreat away from the center of the arena where the Black Wind King will reappear in a large explosion. Take this time to heal up or use any consumable medicines you think might give you an edge. \n\n\n\nAfter losing about half his health, the Black Wind King will get even more aggressive with his titular wind, and start disappearing entirely in a gust without forming into a wisp. When this happens, retreat and regain your stamina, and be ready for the moment he appears, as he’ll likely do so in mid-combo attack. \n\n\n\nThese can include a length combo that he’ll usually start with a shove before stabbing his spear into the ground in front of him, then grabbing onto it to launch himself off feet first before quickly slicing downward at you, and then slamming his fist down for a massive explosion you’ll want to steer clear of. \n\n\n\nAfter his next Black Wind assault, be ready to transform using the Red Tides Spell, and charge up a dash attack the moment he lands in the center of the arena, and use it and the transformation spell’s pogo attack to perform a massive hit once you catch him after a teleport. \n\n\n\nCounter each of his teleports when his attacks complete, and you’ll soon defeat the Yaoguai King, forcing him to retreat as he yells for you to face his true form at the top of the mountain.
