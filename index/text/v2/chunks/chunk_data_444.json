    "content": "The area of Rockrest flat is wide with three major branches from the open area around the Shrine, and all directions are worth noting. \n\n\n\nTo the right when facing the shrine, you can spot stairs leading up past a wooden platform where a Blazebone will attack from its vantage point. \n\n\n\nUp the stairs, a Spearbone with shield guards a spot with a large waterfall of sand. The Spearbone is tougher than average, because defeating him will allow you to claim the Spearbone Spirit to add to your arsenal of transformation attacks! Just beware of his roar that preludes a frenzied combo of spear swings and slams, and use your Immobilize or Cloud Step to skirt around his defenses and attack him instead of his shield. \n\n\n\nTaking a closer look at the sandfall behind this enemy, you’ll find that its actually a magic barrier that can be dispelled, but only if you were able to crack the wall near the First Prince of Flowing Sand and find the Loong Scales. Once you have them, you’ll be able to interact with the sandfall and remove it, opening a door to a very tough secret boss fight - the Black Loong. Due to its difficulty, and some ways to make the fight easier you’ll unlock later, we recommend saving him for later. \n\n\n\nHead back down the stairs from the waterfall of sand and keep to the right to take down more Spearbones and assorted Rock Guai until you reach an opening in the cliff walls with a small wooden fencing you can break open. \n\n\n\nIn this large open field, you’ll find a friendly boar-like Guai resting on a rock. He’s apparently extremely inebriated, and needs you to help him find something to sober him up. He’ll mention “Windrest” if you talk to him again, providing a clue to where you can find such an ingredient. However, you’ll also find that the Man-in-Stone sells a Sobering Stone if you don’t want to explore. Since it costs a hefty 6,480 Will, you’re better off waiting to continue his questline when we explore the Yellow Wind Formation later on. \n\n\n\nBe sure to look around the vast field for items to gather like Fire Bellflower and Fragrant Jade Flowers. If you travel to the edge of the cliff past the field, you can find a **Meditation Point** by a large curved tree, giving you a free Skill Point! \n\nDeadwood Forest, Rockrest Flat Meditation Spot\n\nThe only other part of this field has a large gate that can’t currently be opened, so instead it’s time to return to the Shrine.",
