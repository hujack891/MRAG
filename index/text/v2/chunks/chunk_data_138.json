Thankfully, this attack can be dodged. \n\nIf you've taken the small path to get behind it as we suggested, and got to the Keeper's Shrine, you have the advantage. The cart can't turn around considering it's on such a small path, so you can ignore the fist-slamming attacks entirely and focus just on when it blows out fire all around it. Use the Fireproof Mantle and watch out for when it blows fire. As soon as it dies down, drop down and hit it relentlessly with combos. When it starts to get ready to unleash the fire, jump back up the little ledge to completely avoid it. \n\nBrown-Iron Cart",
