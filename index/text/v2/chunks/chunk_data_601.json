It can be a tough battle, especially as he uses both wind and fire and performs a range of heavy attacks. \n\nWhen you manage to beat him, however, you'll be able to unlock a few rewards: \n\n  * **You'll earn the Ebon Flow spell.** This will allow you to transform into the Yin Tiger, blocking attacks with the giant sword and getting close to foes by dashing forward. \n  * **Return to speak to him and the Challenge option will become Equip More Curios.** This will give you an additional slot for another Curio to be loadout. \n  * **You'll also unlock the following Legendary armor:**\n    * Iron Horned Helmet\n    * Iron-Tough Armor\n    * Iron-Tough Gauntlets\n    * Iron-Tough Greaves",
