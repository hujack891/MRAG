    "content": "While the Cyan Loong is a bit smaller than Black Loong, he is much more ferocious, and can use his lightning powers to quickly deal double damage and tear you to pieces -- especially if you choose to face him after arriving on Turtle Island. You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive. You should also have the Loongwreathe or Kang-Jin Staff, and have a good set of spells equipped that compliment your attacks -- we reccomend Immobilize and Rock Solid, but you can also try using the Ring of Fire to buff yourself up in since the arena is small. \n\nThe Cyan Loong doesn't have a huge amount of attacks, but when they hit, they hit hard! \n\n\n\nOne of his most common attacks will have him briefly swim toward you before diving in to perform two standing sword slashes in quick succession. He'll follow up by floating high and charging up lightning in his hand to strike the ground in front of him, requiring you to dodge both the attack and the resulting strike that appears at the point he touches. \n\n\n\nExpect him to also utilize his sword slashes in simple 1 or 2 hit attacks, or use his lightning palm attack on its own. His sword swings aren't too fast, but they can blindside you if you aren't ready to break off your attacks or use up all your stamina. \n\n\n\nAnother dangerous attack he can launch with little warning only comes with a small tell -- when he quickly swaps his sword to hold in a reverse grip behind his back. He'll then quickly launch himself through the air at you with a spinning slash that can take a chunk off your health, and then dive back to your position after a moment for sword slice when he reaches the ground. \n\n\n\nThe good news is his final sword slice allows for an extended moment to dodge around and attack him from behind. However, you'll need to keep your eyes open when trying to attack from behind, as he can easily whip his mace-like tail around to hit you. Watch for it to rise up to the top left before slashing down to the bottom right to know when to deflect or evade. \n\n\n\nIn addition to his standard sword swings and combos, the Cyan Loong can change things up by charging up and holding his sword back pointed straight at you before launching into a slow two-handed swing, or pausing to spin for a backhand slash as he whirls around. \n\n\n\nThe good news is with his form only slightly bigger than yours, the Cyan Loong is fairly susceptible to being staggered. Even a full Light Combo can send him stumbling backward, which you can mix in with a varied combo and follow up from the Smash Stance, stagger his sword swings with Rock Solid, and use a bulky Spirit attack like the Second Rat Prince to send him sprawling again and again and limit his ability to attack back. \n\n\n\nHowever, once you manage to get his health down to around half, he'll imbue his sword with electricity in drawn out flourish, ending with him stabbing the sword into the ground to send up electric blasts all around him. You can try poking him from a distance with the Thrust Stance but be wary not to get too close. \n\n\n\nWith his freshly empowered sword, Cyan Loong will deal more damage than ever before. A single sword swing can cleave your health apart, and if you already have the shock status effect, you can easily die in a single hit if you aren't careful. Be sure to counter this new phase with Evil Repelling Medicament to increase your defense, and have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand for any moment you do get the status effect. \n\n\n\nSeveral of his moves have also been improved. His electric palm strike for instance now causes several lightning strikes in front of him, up from just a single blast, requiring you to dodge around to his sides instead of backward. \n\nIf he begins to hold his sword back while pointing at you, the air will crackle around him preventing you from getting close, and his two-handed sword swing will also unleash an electric projectile slash you'll need to evade. \n\n\n\nThe good news is that his blade won't stay enchanted forever, often ending with the previously mentioned attack. Once you no longer see electricity crackling along his blade, that's your cue to go back to pressing the attack by getting in staggering blows. \n\n\n\nIn particular, we recommend the Red Tides transformation spell to evade around his attacks while burning him, as he swings are slow enough that you can have an easier time performing the wolf guai's ultimate spell attack for big damage. \n\nThis fight will largely come down to learning his moves enough that you can anticipate and avoid his powerful attacks, and find your opening to keep him staggered and on the defensive. Once you learn how to keep away from his sword swings, you'll be able to take him down for good. \n\n\n\nWhen he falls, you'll earn some Fine Gold Thread and another Loong Pearl, and can loot a nearby chest that appears for the Mountain-Shaking Claw material and Breath of Fire Soak for your Gourd. This new material will unlock the upgrade path for your Loongwreathe Staff into the Golden Loong Staff, but you'll need to find and defeat the last of the four Loongs to craft it. \n\nCyan Loong",
