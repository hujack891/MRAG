    "content": "You can first encounter the Man-in-Stone in the Fright Cliff area of Chapter 2’s Yellow Wind Ridge. You can reach it by traveling through Sandgate Village and defeating the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, and then taking the path across a rope bridge to the right from the large sealed stone door. \n\n\n\nHead up the path through the Fright Cliff area to the **Squall Hideout Shrine** , and then stick to the outdoor path on the right leading to a narrow crevice. You may hear someone calling out to you from down below, so head under the bridge, while watching for ambushes by a new stone enemy variant. The Poisestone is a much smaller and more agile version of the Palestone, able to dash around and expel projectiles. Defeating it will remove the stone body, but the legs will survive, and start to deploy devastating kicks if you don’t lock them down and destroy them. \n\n\n\nAt the end of the crevice, you’ll find an unusual looking stone. He’s actually a **Man-in-Stone** , and claims to have been trapped within the rock form. He’s betting on one of the rock guai in the large cave nearby to hold the secrets to reversing his fate, and **asks you to seek it out**. \n\n\n\nYou’ll find the cave in question just above the crevice on the left side of the path through the Squall Hideout region. Enter the large tunnel and keep to the left to defeat any Rock Guai you come across. \n\n\n\nAt the end of the cave path, you’ll find the object of the Man-in-Stone’s quest - an even larger statue embedded with shining blue crystals. Don’t get too enraptured that you miss a Poisestone along the walls trying to ambush you, though.",
