His initial attack allows you to take his form and swing the long axe-like weapon around in circles for quite some time. The amount of swings you get out of this move is quite impressive and can deal a lot of damage. In addition to that, the equipped effect grants you more Damage Reduction after using the Rock Solid spell. Rock Solid is how you Parry in Black Myth: Wukong, so the spell is already excellent in its own right. Combined with Non-Pure, however, it's even better. \n\nCheck out our other helpful Black Myth: Wukong guides! \n\n  * How-To Guides\")\n  * Key Items\n  * Walkthrough",
