Go left here. \n\n\n\nYou'll see a waterfall in the distance and an archway just before it. Go down to this archway and head inside, where you'll automatically dismount from the cloud. This will take you into Water Curtain Cave, which is the final area of the game. \n\n\n\nAt the start of Water Curtain Cave, go up the slope and to the cliff's edge. Run and jump across the gap to reach the path slightly below and be able to get behind the waterfall. \n\n\n\nHead toward the path on the other side of the cave, where the lamp is glowing. Follow this until you reach the next section with a taller waterfall, then turn left. \n\n\n\nImmediately, you'll see a giant staff in the center of the room. Make your way over to it and let the cutscene  out. \n\n\n\nAfter another story from Zhu Bajie, the giant staff will shrink and you'll be able to get it from the body of water in front of you. Now that you've acquired the Jingubang and look exactly like Wukong, head to the back of the cave directly ahead. \n\nFollow the path to the peak, where you'll come to the Return Path Keeper's Shrine.",
