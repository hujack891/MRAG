This fight is a fairly unorthodox one, and you'll need to expect the unexpected as you face this foe in a very narrow hallway with limited room to dodge. \n\n\n\nThe strange hand has a few different moves it can use both up close and at range you'll need to become familiar with. One of its opening moves will be to slap the wall near you, but that's not all -- the move will cause several rocks to fall from above, and with your limited visibility you'll need to keep dodging around 3-4 large rocks with the last one often being delayed. \n\n\n\nIf you see the hand curl into a fist before raising up, be ready for it to slam down on the ground nearby and claw into the ground, before scraping along the a length of the arena in a quick dash. \n\n\n\nDoing so will often cause the hand to become immobile for a few moments, so be ready to turn around and chase it to follow up some a few attacks. \n\n\n\nIf it curls into a fist but doesn't raise up, watch for a gold glow to empower the hand as it punches around in a wide arch to try and trap you against the wall with. \n\n\n\nAt range, it can also charge up a magical dart that can't be deflected with your staff spin. There's a somewhat quick version where it performs a flicking motion, and a longer charged shot where an aura appears behind the hand. \n\nThankfully, there's ample opportunities to attack the hand after many of its attacks, but the fun is only just beginning. \n\nAfter you get the Buddha's Right Hand to around half of its health it will retreat, and you'll finally meet the owner of the hand. \n\n\n\nThe terrifying creature will lunge down with a scream, and then begin to spew a literal river of poison into a narrow arena. This stream of bile will damage you continuously, and there are only two real ways to avoid it. \n\nIf you're quick, you can dash under it before it starts spewing poison to get around behind it. If not, quickly get up onto a Pillar Stance to perch above the poison. \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, you won't be able to hide up here forever, as the boss will often start to turn its body, and then slam down its hand onto the poison river, but you can slam down first and run for safety. \n\nNow that its body is now clinging to the walls in front of you, you'll need to aim for its face, and the Pillar or Thrust Stance can help with that. \n\n\n\nHowever, the monster has a few new moves you'll need to worry about, like being able to stab down with its front legs. \n\n\n\nIf you notice the monster begin to rise up to where you can't hit it with normal swings, back off and get ready, as it will likely try to punch you with its \"right hand\" slamming through under its body. The good news is the hand is also another target in addition to its head, giving you more places to swing your staff at. \n\n\n\nIf the body appears to rise up and lurch backwards out of reach instead of straight up, it means that the boss is preparing to lunge forward with a headbutt, but this can be deflected and countered while its head is lowered for some prime damage output. \n\n\n\nThe Buddha's Right Hand can also use its hand above to swing its body backward, at which point you'll need to be ready for it to rapidly swing forward and slide through the arena with its talons dragging along. Don't bother trying to deflect it, as you'll just be knocked backward without slowing its momentum. \n\n\n\nOne of its more annoying new attacks is that it can also retch out a cloud of poison bugs that will fly around in front of its head and deal damage to anything nearby. You may just want to back off instead of pressing the attack during this move to avoid taking unnecessary damage. \n\n\n\nSince it won't have too much health left, focus on avoiding its attacks and try to get around its face along the sides to score hits while out of range of many of its attacks, and be ready to dodge falling rocks if it begins shrieking or slamming into walls. \n\n\n\nOnce you have finally depleted its health, it will try to flee the tunnel and fly away, only to be shot down violently -- forming a bridge with its \"hand\". Your mysterious lady friend will return to urge you onward before she disappears. \n\nDefeating this monster will award you an actual Buddha's Right Hand Key Item.
