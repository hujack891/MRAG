    "content": "The Sterness of Stone can be used on the Tallies located in Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge. They allow you to access the path under the Crouching Tiger Temple, and open the locked doors at Sandgate Village - Valley of Despair and Yellow Sand Formation - Windrest Gate Shrines. You will need to use this with the Keeness of Tiger Key Item, which can be found at the Crouching Tiger Temple upon defeating the Tiger Vanguard. \n\nThe first Tally is at the Crouching Tiger Temple, within the arena where you fought the Tiger Vanguard. \n\n\n\nThe first gate can be found right next to the Sandgate Village - Valley of Despair Shrine, on the right. \n\n\n\nThe second gate and final Tally is at the base of the sand slope onwards from the Fright Cliff - Rock Clash Platform Shrine, which is just after the Stone Vanguard fight. \n\n\n\nFor an even more detailed walkthrough of these areas beyond the Tallies, be sure to check out our full walkthrough.",
