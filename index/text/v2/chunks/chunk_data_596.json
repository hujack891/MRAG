Instead,  through Chapter 3 until you reach the Bitter Lake and the Turtle Island Keeper's Shrine. \n\n\n\nYou'll need to wait until you can interact with the Shrine, but when you can, turn and face the water. As you walk toward it, you'll hear a voice again. Look toward the edge of the cliff and down to the left slightly, to see a Dragon Statue that sits by the water. \n\n\n\nAs you approach the statue, it will come to life and you'll be thrown into a fight against Cyan Loong. When you've beaten him, a Treasure Chest will appear in the nearby waterfall, which contains Breath of Fire Soak and Mountain-Shaking Core. You'll also unlock the crafting recipe for the mythical Golden Loong Staff. \n\nCyan Loong",
