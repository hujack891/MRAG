This large Curios item offers a universal buff that can be useful for almost anyone practically. \n\nWith the Tridacna Pendant equipped, all of your spell cooldowns will be reduced slightly, which is key when fighting some of the bosses in Chapter 2 and beyond, as the difficulty ramps up. \n\n\n\nLike the rest of the Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong, this one can't be upgraded, so you are stuck with its basic level of strength. Therefore, you will want to switch to other Curios items if you want a better ability or want one that fits your build more.",
