Falcon Hermits have both wings and fans that work together to send out a large variety of wind-based moves. There is a corkscrew charge move that hits hard and fast, a tornado move that travels around the area, razor-sharp wind gusts, and blunt damage moves inflicted by the Falcon Hermit's fan weapon. \n\nImmobilize can drastically help when fighting a Falcon Hermit, and always keep your eyes peeled for wind-based attacks. These can easily blend in with the snowy surroundings of the mountain.",
