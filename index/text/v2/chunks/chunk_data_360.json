Look for the golden tree near where you saw the Feng-Tail General and Water-Wood Beast. \n\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.",
