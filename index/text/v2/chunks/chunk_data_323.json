The Default Set of Armor and Gear comes with: \n\n  * Tiger Hide Loincloth (body) - 5 Defense\n  * Cotton Wriswraps (arms) - 2 Defense\n  * Cotton Legwraps (legs) - 3 Defense\n\nAll of these pieces of armor are automatically equipped at the start of Chapter 1 - Black Wind Mountain. You can't find these items or get any enhanced versions of them, as they purely serve as some extra protection to get through the initial sections of the game. \n\n\n\nDefault Set\n\nAdditionally, the Default Set of Armor and Gear can't be crafted, as it is the starting armor in the game. \n\nFor even more guides and tips on finding all the items in the game, be sure to check out our guide on all the Black Myth: Wukong Weapons locations, as well as the Gourds, Curios, Vessels, and Transformation Spells locations.
