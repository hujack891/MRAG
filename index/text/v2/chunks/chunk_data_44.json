Be wary of their fast reverse blade swings and jumping claw kicks, and rest up after they’ve been defeated. \n\nThe main path lies up the stairs to the right, but be sure to look in the awning over to the left of the shrine first for some pots to break. Technically, you can find a big shortcut by simply jumping over the rocks to the nearby canyon stream, but there’s important things to find while taking the main route first. \n\n\n\nThe most important of which is just up the stairs and to the right before reaching a large bridge. A strange human man with a giant gourd on his back will be reciting poetry and drawing with his back to you. \n\nAs you approach, he’ll ask if you’ve seen the nameless souls in your travels - referring to the green wisps floating about that only offer a small amount of Will as they fly away. The wise master will take your gourd and inscribe a blessing on it, allowing you to absorb wayward spirits. This will allow you to finally capture the floating green wisps to not only gain much more Will, but also slightly replenish your Gourd’s healing charges. \n\nEven more importantly, you’ll now find that certain enemies will leave behind departed Spirits that can be claimed, and allow you to temporarily transform into them to unleash a specific attack. Unlike the Red Waves spell, these Spirits can be equipped to a special slot, and will become charged as you fight and earn Qi. Once the bar is filled, you can then unleash their attack by holding the right trigger and then the left trigger (R2/RT + L2/LT). \n\n  \nThere’s a chance you may already have one such Spirit, if you decided to test your might early — against the Wandering Wight in the Forest of Wolves. If you already defeated him but were unable to claim his purple spirit, return to a Shrine and you’ll find it under the Retrieve Spirits option, and can then equip it in your inventory. \n\nIf you haven’t yet defeated him, now is a great time to try again — and you can also grab the other wandering green spirit wisps that evaded your grasp the first time around (they’ll reappear after resting): \n\n\n\n  * Below the very first bridge in the Front Hills\n  * Near the arena where you fought Guangzhi and learned the Red Tides spell\n  * At the Guanyin Temple entrance by the Shrine in front of a wolf statue altar\n  * Back down the path in the Bamboo Grove where the falls are\n\n\n\nWhen you’re ready to proceed, head across the large bridge to find a new type of enemy, the Snake Patroller. These spear-wielding snake-men will stand up straight up before lunging at you with a bite that inflicts major damage while poisoning you, which may force you to use Anti-miasma powder to negate its effects. They can also put their spear in their teeth and dash with it held horizontally to swing it about in a combo attack. \n\n\n\nOnce you’ve cleared the snake, check out the next area to find another Snake-Head Mushroom, and continue along the path to a field of bones. Three bodies will come to life as Skeletal Snakes. Thankfully, since it takes a moment for them to come to life, and they are fairly weak, they’ll fall to only a couple of staff strikes — usually before they can try to grab at you. \n\n\n\nHeading down the trail from the Skeletal Snakes, you’ll find a stream where another Snake Patroller wanders, as well as an optional area you can investigate by following the stream instead of going under the bridge (though you should still look just past the bridge to find green wisp spirits to capture for a huge amount of Will). \n\n\n\nThis path leads to a marshy swamp area full of tall white reed flowers. Several Croaky enemies hide within them, so use your lock-on to identify them so you aren’t ambushed. However, as you make your way through the marsh toward a large stone mural in the cliffs, an optional mini-boss will leap out to fight you.",
