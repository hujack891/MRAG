Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. \n\nWith the Mani Bead equipped when Chilled (ice status effect has been maxed) your critical hit chance will moderately increase. This is mostly useful in Chapter 3, thanks to it being set in the icy area, The New West. \n\n\n\nCurios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the Mani Bead will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out.",
