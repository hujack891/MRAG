The yard behind this hut has a Ginsengling you can defeat for extra materials. \n\n\n\nFurther down the main path, you’ll find a large terrace overlooking a ravine below where the black tornado swirls. Guarding this spot is a bolstered Rat Governor, who uses deadly lightning attacks (and can even create temporary copies of himself for added damage!) you’ll want to shut down by Immobilizing him. Defeat this stronger foe, and you’ll be able to absorb the Rat Governor Spirit to perform your own electric attack! \n\n\n\nJust beyond where the Rat Governor was guarding, you can find a **Meditation Spot** down a short flight of stairs that overlooks the ravine, granting you a free Skill Point for resting here. \n\nThe Ravine, Rock Clash Platform Meditation Spot\n\n\n\nTo proceed, head back up the stairs and take a left where a group of braziers are. In the middle of this path is a small altar with a yellow pot, and inside you’ll find a **Celestial Taiyi Pill** , raising your maximum Mana once more by a considerable amount! \n\nYellow Wind Ridge Celestial Taiyi Pill\n\nPast this upgrade, the path will begin to slope down, and quite suddenly you may find yourself slipping and sliding down a one way sandy slope into a new sub-region. It’s worth getting the Shrine at the bottom of this area, but you’ll also need to dodge a lot of Rat Archers that you won’t be able to reach. \n\n\n\nAs you slide, try to angle yourself to the left, and you can find a large structure that you can jump to. \n\n\n\nClear out the archers as best you can and look for some Fragrant Jade Flowers to harvest (plus a green Wisp to absorb on the far side of the upper ridge) before dropping down to the bottom floor of the structure. \n\n\n\nAt the base of a large statue here, you can find a chest to open containing a **Blood of the Iron Bull** , 1 **Small Piece of Gold** , and 4 **Tiny Piece of Gold**. \n\nHop back onto the sands and slide past the rest of the Rat Archers until you reach the bottom of the Ravine.

You may have been able to try it out during the Prologue — this spell allows you to summon several copies of yourself to fight alongside you for a short duration. The copies don’t have much health and it costs a lot of mana to use, but they’ll help you overwhelm enemies in a pinch! \n\nAfter resting at the Windseal Gate Shrine, it’s time to fight the other Vanguard at the **Crouching Tiger Temple**, and we’ll return back to the Yellow Wind Formation area soon enough. \n\nFright Cliff Complete",
