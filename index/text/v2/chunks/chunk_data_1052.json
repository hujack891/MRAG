    "content": "The Fungiwoman behaves almost identically to the Fungiman you fight fought in the Pagoda Realm (and a few times after), only they'll have a bit more health, and deal a bit more damage, but you should know what to expect for most of their attacks. Though they have a boss healthbar, they aren't tracked in your journal for Yaoguai Chief entries. \n\nWhen they rise out of their hiding spot, they'll flood the immediate area with poison, and can do so multiple times, so always be ready to back off when you see noxious fumes billowing up and swap to Thrust Stance. \n\n\n\nThe Fungiwoman can also expel toxic strands from its side to seek you out, but can thankfully by swept aside with a staff spin. The same can also happen if they slam their staff down, creating geysers that spawn additional projectiles. \n\n\n\nLike the Fungiman, this variant can fly through the air to slam down from above on you, only with this move they'll also create poison geysers all around them to spawn the aforementioned projectiles. \n\n\n\nAnother move they share is their rapid spin attack that will seek you out. Keep your distance or use Immobilize to score free hits, and then wait until they fall dizzy to hit them with more attacks. \n\nFor all their extra health, they don't have too many more moves than a regular enemy, so keep on the offensive so they don't have a chance to sprout more spore projectiles, using Immobilize to lock them down and Rock Solid when they try to swipe at you with their staff. \n\nOnce defeated, you'll gain a Knot of Voidness, and a Monkey-Head Fungus Seed to take back to the Zodiac Village, as well as their Fungiwoman Spirit to absorb. \n\nFungiwoman\n\n\n\nBe sure to check the shack on the far end before leaving, as you'll find the **Sunset of the Nine Skies Drink** sittng on a table, which will restore Qi as well as health! \n\n\n\nAs you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple. A long slope here will send you down to a large arena, and its here you'll have your second and final encounter with an old foe - the Venom Daoist.",
