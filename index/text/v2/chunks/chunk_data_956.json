Because of this, it’s recommended that you save challenging this foe until you’re almost complete with Chapter 2 and have a good set of gear and medicines at your disposal to increase damage negation. He’s worth defeating before you fight the final boss of this chapter, as you’ll be able to craft a new weapon upon his defeat.",
