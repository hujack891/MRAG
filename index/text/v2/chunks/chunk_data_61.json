    "content": "Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang is a relentless fighter with attacks that require some quick reaction times to avoid. Here's what you can expect from the fight: \n\n  * A Swipe move where Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang sweeps your feet out from underneath you with its hands. It can also do this with its tongue. \n  * A Smash move where the boss leaps into the sky before crashing back down.\n  * A Double-Leg Kick where both legs are thrust backward with incredible speed and force.\n\nThe main thing to remember when fighting Baw-Lu-Guhh-Lang or any other frog boss is to avoid getting caught behind it. The Double-Leg Kick can be devastating and is very sudden. Stick to its front where you can more easily predict its moves.",
