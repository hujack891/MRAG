It is one of the harder Curios items to find as it is located within the secret area of Chapter 2. \n\nWith the Tiger Tally equipped, you will get the following buff: Upon successful hits with light attack combo, moderately increases attack for a short duration. This is a specialized effect, requiring a trigger to activate, but the damage buff is decent, and most of the time you will be landing a full light attack combo in a fight anyway. \n\n\n\nAll Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you aren't able to increase their power or potency. Therefore, you will want to switch to other Curios items to better fit your build as you . This can be done at any point from the Equipment menu.",
