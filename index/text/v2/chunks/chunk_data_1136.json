The Soak's ability is incredibly strong, making it one of the better options to choose. \n\nWith the Undying Vine Soak equipped, using the gourd instantly recovers a great amount of stamina and increases stamina recovery rate for a short duration. \n\nSoaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor.",
