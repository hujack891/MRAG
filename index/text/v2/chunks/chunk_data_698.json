    "content": "The Misty Cloud, Cloudy Mist fight can be difficult since there are two foes to contend with. Thankfully, they usually take turns fighting you, so you won't be tackling both of them at once for the entire fight. As you're fighting one, the other will eventually pop up, leaving the first to disappear for a while so you can focus on the second. There will be times, however, when they will both be present, so keep your eyes peeled. \n\nCloudy Mist is the first enemy you will encounter in this fight. Cloudy Mist has a large staff that deals ice damage and creates thin laser beams of light that track you around the arena. He can also summon white balls of ice that follow and bombard you if you get caught in their path. \n\nMisty Cloud is the second foe that will appear. His weapon of choice is a burning log of incense that he swings around, usually in sets of three. Dodge each swing until the combo is complete before rushing in to land your own hits.",
