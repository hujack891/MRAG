They are armed with giant, metal shields akin to those of Spearbones and use them to perform a similar charge move. Unlike Spearbones, however, the Earth Rakshasa can also create an explosion of fire to damage you even further. \n\nTo defeat the Earth Rakshasa, hang back and wait until the enemy charges you. Dodge to the side just before the attack hits and quickly run back to hit it in the back and damage the Earth Rakshasa's body instead of its shield. It can be difficult to get around the shield, but casting Immobilize makes it much easier if you're struggling.",
