Using the Rattle-Drum here one final time will cause the spirit of the boy to appear before you, and invite you to **hop down the well** to meet a “friend”. \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there.
