You'll actually need to make some progress through Chapter 2 until you can find the key item that will allow you to gain access to the area and tick off the last boss from Chapter 1. \n\n\n\nThe item you're looking for is the **Loong Scales** , and they're cleverly hidden away just beyond Sandgate Village. After the mini-boss fight against the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, follow the golden trail to find the next Keeper's Shrine. From here, enter the nearby cave. \n\nIn the main room of this cave, you'll find a pit, and near it is a wall where a section has lots of tiny statues carved into it. You'll need to **break this wall to reveal a crack** that will allow you to squeeze through it. Inside, you can find the Loong Scales in a treasure chest. \n\n\n\nBreaking the wall is a little bit trickier than it seems because it requires **an especially powerful attack** , and what happens in the pit also depends on how the fight with the King of Flowing Sands went. You'll either see a cutscene if you let him live or need to use a Pungent Flesh Chunk to get the First Prince of Flowing Sands to appear if you killed him. \n\n\n\nIf you're lucky, you can actually use the First Prince of Flowing Sands to crack the wall for you if you are able to bait him into lunging into the wall. Alternatively, you can use a spirit such as the Wandering Wight Spirit and transform into it to use the head bash and split the wall. \n\n\n\nOnce you've picked them up from the treasure chest, a voice will begin speaking to you. This will also happen when you're near the bosses, but now that you've collected the Loong Scales, you're ready to unlock some secret areas!",
