This is a mandatory boss, so you can't miss them. \n\nFrom there you can head into the caves below the Valley of Despair Shrine and use the Pungent Flesh Chunk on the cliff edge. The best method to get the boss to destroy the wall is to stand against the wall at a short-to-medium distance from the boss and have it do its slam with its hand. It will do this by turning to its right with its fist along the ground. Alternatively, you can bait the boss' charge and take a hit to ensure the boss hits the wall. \n\n\n\nFollowing that you can head through the wall to get the Loong Scales from the chest. \n\nLoong Scales",
