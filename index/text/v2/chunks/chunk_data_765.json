    "content": "The Old Gourd is the starting Gourd on offer in Black Myth: Wukong. It is by far the simplest Gourd in the game, focusing entirely on refilling your health.

Doing this turns it into the Medicine Gourd, Healing Gourd, Medicine Sage Gourd, and Medicine Master Gourd with each upgrade. \n\nThe upgrades for this Gourd are: \n\n  * Old Gourd\n  * Medicine Gourd\n  * Healing Gourd\n  * Medicine Sage Gourd\n  * Medicine Master Gourd\n  * Supreme Gourd\n\nThat final Gourd upgrade requires you to have already levelled up your Gourd to 9 Healing Charges. You can then interact with the NPC at Furnace Valley - Rakshasa Palace in Flaming Mountains to get the final upgrade. \n\nHowever, you will likely move onto using a different Gourd as you reach Chapters 2 and 3, to get the better healing effects and unique effects. \n\nAs mentioned, you can't find the Old Gourd. It is given to you by default at the start of Chapter 1. It is provided alongside the default starting weapon in the game, as well as the basic equipment and gear set. \n\nOld Gourd\n\nFor even more guides and tips on finding all the Gourd customisation items, be sure to check out our other guides.
