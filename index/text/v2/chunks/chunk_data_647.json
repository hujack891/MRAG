You can ignore these and let Lang-Baw-Baw tackle them; they make for a good distraction so you can focus on hitting the frog while it attacks the soldiers. \n\n\n\nWhen it comes to the one-to-one with Lang-Baw-Baw, you can expect to see the same type of moves that the previous frog bosses have used (if you've taken them all down so far). Expect to see it use its tongue as a whip to try and hit you, which you can dodge and dash away from. It will also leap up and try to belly flop you, as well as use its back kicks to quickly lash out when you're behind it. \n\n\n\nThe big difference with Lang-Baw-Baw is that you need to watch the color of its body to know when it's best to attack and in what way. When its body is red, it's vulnerable to attack. In this state, you'll do the most damage, so you'll want it to stay like this for as long as possible. \n\n\n\nAfter a certain amount of time, he will solidify, turn brown, and become like stone. If you hit him during this state, your attacks will bounce off of him, though they will do minimal amounts of damage. When he's like this, he will start to use rocks to attack. He can also roar, which will momentarily stun you and damage you at the same time. \n\n\n\nExpect to see him using rocks like shockwaves, where he'll punch the ground and disturb the ground underneath you, and also call rocks up into the air. When this happens, he'll roar and send them hurtling toward you. Another variation of a rock attack he performs is that a circle of rocks will spike up from the ground on occasion. \n\n\n\nThe key is to get him out of this state as soon as possible because it can be an annoying fight otherwise. It's easy to be killed when you're being bombarded with rock attacks in this phase. You can perform heavy attacks when he's in this phase, and you'll knock him flat and still do plenty of damage. But the best thing you can do is throw out the Plantain Fan. He'll go back to being red immediately, and be repeatedly pushed back. Stick close to him when the fan is hitting to keep attacking. \n\n\n\nIf he goes back into this state when you don't have the fan available, it's just a matter of hanging back and avoiding attacks until he changes back to red. \n\nLang-Baw-Baw",
