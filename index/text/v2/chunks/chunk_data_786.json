    "content": "The good news is the Macaque Chief doesn't have many more surprises for you since the last fight -- even less since he won't bother trying to fake begging for mercy this time around. You'll also be much stronger since the last time you met, so this fight may not even take a long. \n\n\n\nIf it's been awhile since you fought him last, remember that his one major attack will have him jump into the air and slam his blade into the ground, and then perform series of quick claw swipes in front of him with surprising reach, all while keeping close to the blade behind him -- meaning he can't really pivot if you dodge and attack from the sides. \n\nHe'll step back to grab the sword with his foot and jump onto its hilt, before preforming a quick roll along the ground to drag the sword in a whirlwind slice with a large reach to it, followed by a final downward slam, so don't press your attack too hard during this combo, or Immobilize him before the second part of his combo. \n\n\n\nA longer deadly combo attack he can employ comes with three quick slashes ending in a jumping upward slash. After a brief pause in the air, he'll use his foot to send the blade slamming down vertically, and then yank it back up in an arc for a final two-hand diagonal slice attack. Your Rock Solid won't always stagger him mid-combo, so it's better to wait and parry the final slice so you can retaliate faster. \n\n\n\nIf he begins to hold the blade in both hands, prepare for an extended attack with three alternating slices ending in an upward swing with a long delay. When he finally brings the blade down, he'll do so in a spinning multi-hit slash, followed by a final slam to emit a projectile slash. \n\n\n\nAs an added bonus for this fight, you can actually use the Ancient Master's circle of fire to your own advantage, as the Macaque Chief can't move through it. If you ever see him preparing for a big series of slashes or need to get away and heal simply move to the opposite side of the circle, and his attacks won't reach you. \n\n\n\nWhen you've depleted the Macaque Chief's health yet again, he'll retreat for a second time, but the Wise Master will ask that you hold off your pursuit. In exchange for staying put for a bit, he will impart to you the secret of his **Ring of Fire Spell**! \n\nMacaque Chief (Warding Temple)\n\nThis spell can be swapped out with Immobilize, providing a more defensive variant on temporarily neutralizing enemies. With it, you'll be able to create a small limited barrier for yourself, which can be essential when preparing for a tough fight and using consumables and heals, or removing chilling effects. \n\n\n\nHead around the side of the temple after the Wise Master departs, and you can find a **Treasure Chest** around the side of the temple holding some materials. \n\n\n\nHead up the stairs to the left and head through the hall lined with more Frozen Corpses to leave this area behind. At the top of the nearby hill, you can spot a large cymbal wedged in the rocks of a high peak overlooking a lake below. By sliding down the slope, you'll enter the new region along the **Bitter Lake**, and slide headfirst into a formidable boss fight! \n\nPagoda Realm Complete",
