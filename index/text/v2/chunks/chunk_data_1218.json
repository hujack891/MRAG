Similar to the Upper Hollow, there's a few diverging paths -- some that lead to optional areas and bosses, and some that reconnect back to the main path down to the Lower Hollow. \n\nYou can look out among the cliffs to spy other large platforms in the distance, but the only way forward for the moment is by going right along a twisting root bridge. \n\n\n\nA Grasshopper Guai will spring out of a cocoon as you cross, and defeating it will drop the **Locust Antennae Mask** (if you don't get it, you may have to defeat the other Grasshoppers trapped in cocoons back in the Upper Hollow). \n\n\n\nImmediately, you'll be presented with a choice: Going to the right of where the enemy was leads on to the Middle Hollow \"village\", while taking the left path leads to another optional area -- which we'll be taking first. \n\n\n\nStill, you can briefly explore the right passage to find an upper ledge overlooking the next area with a green Wisp nearby, before heading back. \n\n\n\nAs you cross the small bridge, you can find a small archway on the right, with two talking lanterns that appear to be shouting \"big day!\" \n\nAs you approach, a mysterious woman (the same one that killed the yaoguai at the start of the chapter) will silence the lanterns, before offering up that there's a supposed treasure beyond the archway. \n\n\n\nSince she seems like a trustworthy sort, head on inside, and you'll indeed find a literal trove of **Treasure Chests**! \n\nLooting them all, you'll be able to obtain a Xiang River Goddess Gourd, Enhanced Ginseng Pellet Formula, Gold Ridge Beast, and Purple-Veined Peach Pit Soak, plus several materials like Fine Gold Thread! \n\nThat's not all you can find, as there's an exit beyond leading to an outdoor cliff full of tiny cocoons, where the mother of all worms awaits you.",
