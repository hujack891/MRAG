Go right from the shrine, and find where it slopes down. \n\n\n\nAt the back, there's a small bridge that you can pass under and follow a small stream. At the end of it, you'll find the Man-in-Stone trapped. \n\n\n\nTo help him, you'll need to beat the Mother of Stones boss you can find up the stairs to the left just before Rockrest Flat Keeper's Shrine. Defeating the Mother of Stones will grant you the Stone Essence key item you'll need to hand over to the Man-in-Stone. \n\n\n\nFor a detailed walkthrough of the area and how to find both the Man-in-Stone and the Mother of Stones boss, see our Fright Cliff walkthrough. \n\nGiving him the Stone Essence will result in you needing to attack him. But once you've shown him who's boss, he'll turn into a merchant. The Sobering Stone costs 6,480 Will from him.",
