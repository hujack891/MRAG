There are few Withered Corpses here to jump out at you from behind pots, but won’t be too much of a problem. \n\n\n\nOnce you’ve cleared the hall of Withered Corpses, look where the one hiding behind several large pots was, and you can find an altar with a gold pot. Open it, and you’ll receive a **Celestial Jade Lotus Pill** , massively improving your maximum health! \n\nYellow Wind Ridge Celestial Jade Lotus Pill\n\nPast the Celestial Pill, there will be a large pillar decoration, with a passage on the other side leading down to an open cave below the temple. \n\n\n\nHere, you’ll find a large group of unique enemies not found elsewhere - Civet Sergeants. These small cat-like Yaoguai are armed with two swords apiece, and are led by an emboldened Civet Sergeant who boasts more health and attack, as he drops the Civet Sergeant Spirit when killed. \n\n\n\nDue to their overwhelming numbers and ferocity of their relentless strikes, it can be hard to clear them out safely. This is a perfect place to unleash the Azure Dust Transformation to slam into them as a Rock Guai. The more they attack you on all sides with tiny blades, the faster you’ll charge your Might to unleash your big area of effect spell attack. \n\nOutside of your transformation, try to use Spirits who can attack multiple targets like the Earth Wolf’s charge, and consider using the Pillar Stance’s heavy attack to spin around on staff and attack the group as a whole. \n\n\n\nAs you head up the stairs of the darkened cave, be sure to keep an eye on the right of the chamber for a long wooden chest that holds **Will** and 2 **Silk**. \n\n\n\nWhen you finally find your way outside, look to the right to find a sloping sandy path leading down. There’s actually a ledge ahead in the ruined building with a chest, but getting it to can be the most aggravating experience unless you use a trick. \n\n\n\nOrdinarily you’ll slip and slide on past, unable to do much or jump off to the sides. However, if you jump right before reaching the ledge, perform a heavy attack in mid-air, and you’ll do a small double jump before crashing down. Done correctly, you’ll get enough height to land right by the small turtle chest, which holds a **Tiger Relic** Soak for your Gourd! \n\n\n\nSlide down the rest of the way, and you’ll come up to a Shrine for the Crouching Tiger Temple’s Cellar. In the far corner of the cellar, you’ll find a familiar friendly face - the Xu Dog you helped get medicine recipes for! \n\nTalk to him while he’s in front of his large furnace, and the Xu Dog will thank you for your help thus far with a Mind Core. He'll also teach you the art of crafting your own Celestial Medicines in addition to the Mortal Medicine consumables you’ve been creating. \n\n\n\nCelestial Medicines are sort of like passive buffs you can apply by trading in Mind Cores, which can be found in a variety of places - both by defeating bosses and sometimes regular enemies, or in chests. The buffs range from the familiar ones like health/stamina/mana increases much like the Celestial Pills, but also other stats like Crit Chance or resistance to certain afflictions. \n\nThe best part of these new passive buffs is that you have the option to reset them like your Skill Tree, which will give you back all the Mind Cores you’ve used thus far, allowing you to come back and reallocate points to suit your needs. \n\nBefore heading out, be sure to also buy the **Longevity Decoction** formula for 2,700 Will. It will allow you to craft a consumable that temporarily raises max health, allowing you to survive a bit longer in deadly boss fights. \n\nDown past the Shrine, you’ll finally find the way down to the final boss of Chapter 2. However, there’s a lot more to the Yellow Wind Formation sub-region than just the boss, including the path beyond the Crouching Tiger Temple, and the other doors yet to be unlocked. Our next stop will be to explore a large optional part of the **Yellow Wind Formation** above at the Windrest Bridge. \n\nCrouching Tiger Temple Complete",
