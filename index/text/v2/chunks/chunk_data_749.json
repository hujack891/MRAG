The man had a dream that the fox attacked his family one night and killed the fox upon waking for fear that the dream may become a reality. \n\nWhile exploring the New West, you will come across a corpse slumped over at a gate. Interact with the corpse to get a mission from the fox. She wants you to take her to the man who took her life. The man in question is Non-Void, and he can be found on the left wing of the New Thunderclap Temple complex. \n\n\n\nTo get there, head to the New Thunderclap Temple and pass through the entrance. Head straight ahead through the second building and take the stairs on the left. Keep heading left and into the red building on the side. Run up the stairs on the right, around the veranda, and up the stairs at the back to find yourself in the left-wing courtyard. Run up the stone stairs to find Non-Void waiting in the temple. \n\nIf you get hit as the fox you will transform back into the monkey. Use the Snow Fox Brush to turn back into the fox again before entering the temple to complete her quest. The brush will be in your inventory after initiating the quest.",
