However, you'll soon find that poison isn't the only new thing that this particular boss brings to the table. Still, having Antimiasma Pills can be essential to your survival, due to the ability for you to resist repeat poisoning when consuming them. \n\n\n\nBy now you should be more than familiar with these frogs' basic attacks - the leaps, the swipes and backhands, the belly thrust, and the backward kicks. They'll likely deal a lot of damage on their own, which makes his unique attacks all the more terrifying. \n\n\n\nAfter taking a bit of damage, Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw will rear back and spew out poison while looking above. This will cause a literal poison rain to cascade down, covering a huge portion of the arena in toxicity that will build your poison meter at an alarming rate. It is sometimes possible to Pillar Stance out of the poison, but the frog's repeated attacks will likely knock you down anyway. \n\n\n\nThis leaves two options: Retreat and continue the fight in a severely reduced space, or pop an Antimiasma Pill and brute force ahead while your immunity lasts. Given that the frog can also do a regular spew of poison in a wide arc that creates more hazardous spots on the ground, it's often better to just rely on the pills rather than restricting your movement even more. \n\nIf you thought that was the extent of his moves, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. Perhaps you've been wondering ever since defeating Buddha's Right Hand where the other hand went? Turns out, it's inside Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw! \n\n\n\nWhen he gets to around half his health or so, the boss will start using tongue attacks on you, only the tongue is actually a very long hand with its own unique and bizarre attacks! \n\n\n\nWhat used to be a standard straight tongue attack will now also retract while he fires to projectiles as the hand flicks its fingers to fire magic darts in quick succession, meaning even if you dodge the tongue-hand shooting out, you need to dodge when it retracts as well. \n\n\n\nHe can also wave the tongue-hand around in a haphazard fashion, making it weave in a large arc from side to side as it swipes at you three times, before rising high up to slam down at you (but you can use Rock Solid to send him tumbling back in surprise). \n\n\n\nThe most devious attack of all doesn't even start with his tongue. If you've studied his regular attacks, his hand slaps almost always start with his right hand (to your left) when not performing a large leap. However, if you see him quickly raise his left hand while hopping close (to your right) dodge immediately, or you'll be grabbed. \n\n\n\nThis will cause his tongue-hand to shoot out and carry you upwards, fill you with poison immediately, and then slam you down! It's more than likely this will eliminate almost all your health, leaving the poison to finish the job if you aren't quick with an antimiasma pill (or took one earlier). \n\n\n\nIt may take a bit to learn and anticipate all of his surprises, and you can try using the Thrust Stance to get some distance away from his close-range moves. Make the most of your deflections or Immobilize to press your attack and augment it with Spirits and Transformations to keep the boss staggered so that you can finish him off. \n\nWhen Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw is defeated, you'll gain another Tadpole to upgrade your frog Spirit, as well as the Left Hand of Buddha! This means you can now use both hands to craft and purchase a special Immortal Blessing Gourd when you visit the Shen Monkey in the Zodiac Village! \n\nBaw-Li-Guhh-Baw",
