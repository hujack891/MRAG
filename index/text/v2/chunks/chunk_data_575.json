The first place you'll come to is Windrest Bridge, which will take you up to Windrest Hamlet. \n\n\n\nFrom the Windrest Bridge Keeper's Shrine, go across the bridge and into the small town ruins. On the other side of the bridge, go left. Then, take the stairs up to the right. \n\n\n\nAs you step into the next courtyard, turn to the left. You'll see a building with a broken wall. Head towards the gap here, and you'll find a glowing pot with the Sobering Stone in it.",
