    "content": "The Gall Gem is likely to be the first of the Soaks you find in Black Myth: Wukong during your exploration of Black Wind Mountain. The Gall Gem is one of the most basic Soaks, giving you a slight buff, although not quite as drastic of a buff as many of the others you will find later on. \n\nWhile not quite as potent as Drinks, Soaks are important to your overall build to ensure you have an extra passive buff that benefits your style or game while you heal. Having the Gall Gem equipped to your Gourds will moderately increase Poison Resistance for a short duration after using the Gourd. \n\n\n\nUnlike the Drinks in the game and the Gourd itself, Soaks can't be upgraded at the Shen Monkey Vendor, so you are stuck with this small poison resistance buff throughout the game if you have it equipped. So, be sure to head back to the Shen Monkey Vendor at any point if you do want to change your Soak or how your Gourd behaves.",
