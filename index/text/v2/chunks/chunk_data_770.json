This boss battle can be found at the far end of the Yellow Wind Formation region, at the very end of the **Windrest Hamlet** along a large stone bridge leading back to the Fright Cliff region. \n\nAfter defeating the Tiger’s Acolyte, you’ll gain the Old-Rattle Drum, which appears to have belonged to the Acolyte’s son, but no other details are provided. You will need to find three areas where you can use the drum to summon a spirit, in **locations all across the Yellow Wind Ridge**. The only clue you’ll have is that entering the correct area will **cause your vision to warp** , and the ghostly voice of a boy calling out to you.",
