Due to its strength, and the fact it has 8 uses by default, the Immortal Blessing Gourd can't be upgraded. \n\nWhen you have the Legendary Immortal Blessing Gourd equipped, your health recovery is actually halved. However, your attack is increased for a short duration after using it, allowing you to deal significantly more damage than you would normally. This is a huge tradeoff, however, so it won't be for everyone, and you may want to opt for another Gourd in the game or the traditional Old Gourd, which you can upgrade to the Supreme Gourd.",
