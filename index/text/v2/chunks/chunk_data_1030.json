The Soak's ability is powerful, and definitely one of the stronger ones in the game. \n\nWith the Soak equipped, using the gourd moderately extends the duration of the next Immobilize Spell for a short duration. \n\nSoaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor.",
