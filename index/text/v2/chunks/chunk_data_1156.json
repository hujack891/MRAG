Firstly, it can summon smaller tree minions to fight alongside it and distract you while it launches its own attacks, using its head to spin around in a circle. It also outstretches one leg while spinning around in an effort to knock you off your feet. \n\nThankfully, Verdant Glow is so large that it is rather slow. This gives you plenty of time to land some hits while it's getting ready to launch another attack of its own.",
