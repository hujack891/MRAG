They can be used several times each life to restore a chunk of your health, alongside some other buffs for a brief period, as you upgrade each Gourd. \n\nThey are pretty rare, and there are only a few different ones hidden throughout the game’s chapters, so you will need to keep an eye out to get them all or find the best Gourd to use.",
