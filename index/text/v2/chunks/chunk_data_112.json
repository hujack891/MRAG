They don’t replenish over time, and the wares will be different when you reach the next chapter, so there’s no real reason not to stock up. \n\nOnce you’re ready, head up to the peak to find a large pagoda where the first of the Six Senses of the Great Sage rests. Before you can claim it, you’ll have to go through the true form of the Black Wind King.",
