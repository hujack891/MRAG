Be sure to check all of his options out: \n\n  * **Upgrade Gourds** \\- By using the  Luojia Fragrant Vine you just found by the nearby Shrine, you upgrade the charges in your **Old Gourd** from 4 swigs to 5, turning into a Medicine Gourd, and giving you more uses of its healing properties.\n  * **Upgrade Drinks** \\- The default drink stored in your healing Gourd is **Coconut Wine** , which restores a third of your health for each swig. Once you find Awaken Wine Worms, return to him and you’ll be able to upgrade the amount healed with each use!\n  * **Brew** \\- With your equipped Drink, you can enhance it by adding a Soak to increase additional effects beyond the heal. You can try it out now by adding the **Gall Gem** , which will increase your poison resistance in addition to the heal from your Gourd.\n  * Store - If the Gall Gem isn’t all that enticing, be sure to check his shop, as the Shen Monkey also sells items. He’ll only sell an **alternate Soak** to start with, but will upgrade his stock as your advance through new chapters.",
