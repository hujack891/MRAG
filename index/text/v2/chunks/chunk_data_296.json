Not only will it shoot flames out at the bottom all around it, but it will also roll around and try to mow you down. \n\nAs soon as you see smoke start to build around it, you'll want to move out of its way, because this is when the fire is coming. Beyond that, you'll also notice tweaks to the punching attacks. Rather than just slamming its fists down once, it will try to land a combo of punches. \n\nTo make the fight easier, use Immobilize to keep the cart locked in place. That way, you and the Pale-Axe Stalwart can work together to quickly whittle down its health. \n\nCrimson-Silver Cart",
