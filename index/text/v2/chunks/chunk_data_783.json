Over on the left, look for a lone tree in the cave pool to find a **Luojia Fragrant Vine** to grab, and be sure to revisit the Shen Monkey to upgrade your gourd. \n\nOutside the Wheel Luojia Fragrant Vine\n\nAs you exit the cave, you'll find yourself at the bottom of a gorge with more plants to harvest as you proceed. \n\n\n\nAbsorb the green Wisp in a small tunnel you can pass through, and on the other side you'll see a few stone lanterns marking an area with a small gold pot.

As the gorge path opens up, you can spy an even bigger pagoda than the one you just escape from high up above you. \n\nHead through this area either taking the low path to the left, or check the upper path on the right where many Frozen Corpses have gathered around a Tree Pearl you can harvest. \n\n\n\nThe lower left path leads to another tentacle abomination you'll have to deal with carefully to avoid his lashing an boulder slam, and then head into a tunnel on the right. \n\n\n\nClear out the Frozen Corpses in the small tunnel leading into another narrow gorge guarded by a Yaksha Patroller. \n\n\n\nJust past him, you'll find a long stone staircase to ascend and chase the golden trail of a nearby Shrine.
