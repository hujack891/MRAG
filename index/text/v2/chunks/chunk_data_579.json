When you've met these conditions, he returns to the area where you first found him. This time, however, he won't be sitting on the rock. \n\n\n\nInstead, look to the slope on the right when you first enter the area, to see him standing waiting. Approach him, and he won't be too happy about you having the gold piece, sparking a duel between the two of you. \n\n\n\nBeating him will reward you with the Snout Mask headgear piece, but you'll also be able to go into the door that's at the top of the slope here.
