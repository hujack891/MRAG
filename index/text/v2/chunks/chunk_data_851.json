    "content": "Red Tides is one of the Transformation Spells found within Black Myth: Wukong. It is one of the most powerful Transformations you can find within the game's early chapters, thanks to its extremely strong heavy attacks. \n\nThe Spell allows you to transform into a wolf guai and inflict Scorch Bane on the enemy with each attack. Red Tides' moveset is as follows: \n\n  * **Light Attack: Moon Dance - Continuously slash at the enemy building up Focus.** This is a fast flurry of swings with Red Tides' blade that can stun-lock an enemy and catch them off guard from behind.\n\n\n\n  * **Heavy Attack: Moon Chase - Unleash a series of dash attacks.** This attack can be performed with or without focus to dash across an area, performing a potent strike as you do so.\n\n\n\n  * **Follow Dodge With Heavy Attack - Perform a powerful set of slams after dodging.** This is Red Tides' strongest move, consisting of a slam. Several vertical slams can devastate an opponent's or boss' health bar and can be performed by repeatedly performing a Heavy Attack after using the first one following a dodge.",
