You can find some Gentian plants around here as you exit, and up ahead you can find the Frost-Clad Path Shrine. \n\nLike the previous chapters, this shrine has a whole new store for you to browse, and you'll also be able to start investing in crafting the Ochre Armor Set and Rat Sage Staff (or possibly the Loongwreathe Staff as well if you defeated the Red Loong and Black Loong in the previous chapters). These weapons will cost a fair amount of Will and other materials, so check your inventory often for when you have enough to upgrade, and also look into stocking up on new items: \n\nThe New West Shrine Shop   \n---  \nBody-Warming Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Longevity Decoction (x3) - 270 Will |   \nMind Core (x4) - 1800 Will | Cold Iron Leaves (x2) - 900 Will | Refined Iron Sand (x1) - 1200 Will |   \nAged Ginseng (x10) - 90 Will | Fire Bellflower (x10) - 120 Will | Tree Pearl (x10) - 180 Will | Snake-Head Mushroom (x10) - 120 Will   \nGolden Lotus (x5) - 180 Will | Celestial Pear (x5) - 240 Will | |   \n  \nFrom the shrine, head up the path through the mountain. Compared to the previous chapter, you'll find this area much more linear like in Chapter 1. \n\n\n\nAs you reach a group of bodies frozen in the snow, a strange monkey will be alerted to your presence, throwing a piece of fruit at one of the corpses to awaken it from its slumber. \n\nNot all of the Frozen Corpses you'll find along this path will come alive, but those that do hold either spiked maces or very long blades, and will slowly swat at you or do leaping attacks with them. \n\n\n\nLuckily, they don't have much health and are easily dodged -- but note that the Frozen Corpses with spiked maces will swing wildly a few times after they've been \"killed\" so street clear of their death throes. \n\n\n\nYou can head past the small building the other monkey was perched on, or swing around the back side to find a small alternate path. This area leads up to a large column with a green Wisp you can absorb, and two Frozen Corpses guarding it. \n\n\n\nHead back up the main path through more Frozen Corpses, taking them on one at a time so you don't get overwhelmed. Once you reach the top of this area you'll find a large snowy field where the monkey is waiting for you.",
