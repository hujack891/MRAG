Unlike the village above, this sprawling area just goes deeper and deeper underground, and is full of alternate pathways and twisting passages leading to the lower levels. Be sure to also check your weapons to craft a new Chitin Staff from defeating The Second Sister. \n\n  \nNote - You can actually warp back to the Zhu Estate in the previous area to find the village in a different light. From some reason it will be daylight when you return, and nearly all the enemies will be gone, save for a Lantern Holder that opened the door for you where you fought the Second Sister. Defeat this lone foe, and you'll be able to claim the Lantern Holder Spirit! \n\nThe Upper Hollow area consists of a small group of houses to the left, and a larger pathway to the right that rings around the level, providing multiple points to drop down to the lower level. The main path rings around to the right of the shrine, so we'll check out the other side first. \n\n\n\nStraight ahead from the Shrine, you'll find a Puppet Tick overlooking the cliff past some houses. A sloping path to the left leads down to a broken bridge with a green Wisp to absorb, and a nearby shack has a **Treasure Chest** full of materials guarded by a Puppet Spider and various Stone Spiders. \n\n\n\nHead up the stone stairs back up the slope to find more houses and a green Wisp behind one, with a Lantern Holder out front. Here's a series of stairs leading even higher up from here, leading to a large walled gate. \n\n\n\nAs you head through the gate, look on the other side for a small **Turtle Chest** , and inside you'll find a **Goji Shoots Soak** for your Gourd! \n\n\n\nBeyond the wall, you can find a thin ledge leading along the rocky cave wall guarded by a Dragonfly Guai peppering you with poison arrows. After you cross the gap, you can spot torches up the wall on the right, and a lower path to the left leading back down to an overlook for the Upper Hollow Shrine, complete with a green Wisp to absorb along the ledge. \n\n\n\nJust to the right of this ledge, there's a small cave lined with tiny cocoons everywhere, and a few medium-sized cocoons that will burst to reveal ugly looking Minor Amourworms. They can't do too much other than thrash about or lunge (a surprisingly long distance in a short span), but the one you'll want to worry about is the larger cocoon in the middle that holds a Lesser Amourworm. \n\n\n\nHe's much bigger than the rest, meaning his thrashing does more damage, but you can still attack safely from a distance with the Thrust Stance. Behind the larger worm, you'll find a reward in the form of **Treasure Chest** that holds assorted materials. \n\n\n\nFinally, you can head up the torch-lit path outside this cave guarded by many Stone Spiders. At the end of the path is a small gap leading to a room that seems to be an entrance pit of some sort, as a large green Wisp floats above a bed of cobwebs. In fact, if you return to the Zhu Estate above and try jumping in the pit again, you'll end up in this very spot! \n\n\n\nReturning to the Upper Hollow Shrine, look for a small stone stair path up to the right past the shack, leading across to a large area brimming with assorted cocoons. \n\n  \nA note on cocoons: you'll encounter many of these throughout the Webbed Hollow, in various shapes and sizes. Some contain enemies and will wriggle about as you approach, but it is sometimes possible to attack the cocoon fast enough to stop whatever is inside from emerging. The smaller cocoons don't have yaoguais within, but do provide Will when broken. Even better, this area is likely to give you up to three **Rice Cocoons** when breaking a random tiny cocoon, and one or more **Spine in the Sack Curios** when breaking slightly larger cocoons, so they're worth destroying as you progress! \n\n\n\nWatch out for a few Grasshopper Guai trapped in some of the larger cocoons as you approach a large hole in the middle of the path with an archer on the far side. There's actually a wooden ledge near here that offers one of two ways to drop down to a lower level, but we'll backtrack to this spot later since it's a lengthy and one-way trip. \n\n\n\nGrab the green Wisp near where the archer was posted, and continue on through another large cave full of more cocoons, with some Puppet Ticks tending to them, and a few Wasp Guai stuck in the cocoons. They can be a little tricky to pin down with their constant darting around, so either bait them into diving into a Rock Solid, or use your Thrust or Pillar Stance to knock them out of the air. \n\n\n\nAs you near the end of the passage, keep your eyes on the right to spot a small alcove where the glow of a green Wisp will entice you over to investigate. There's a few Puppet Spiders waiting to ambush you when you draw close, however. \n\n\n\nIn the next passage, a Puppet Tick walks among more cocoons and Stone Spiders that will sprout up, while a Dragonfly Guai on a ledge nearby will try to fill you with poison while your distracted. Try to prioritize him first either by sprinting or Cloud Stepping over to him. \n\n\n\nFinally, the cave passage will open up on the left, but there's one more section to check straight ahead. The smaller path leads to a room with a Beetle Captain guarding a Treasure Chest on a higher ledge. The captain will be tougher to beat, so be ready for his quick flitting movements and try to anticipate his charges to deflect with Rock Solid, or pin him in place with Immobilize. Defeating him will allow you to gain the Beetle Captain Spirit, while the **Treasure Chest** on the ledge holds a Gold Tree Core, Mind Core, and other random materials. \n\n\n\nTake the other path leading out of the cave-like passage, where you'll find a Lantern Holder waiting along with the Puppet Spider dangling above. \n\n\n\nYou'll now find yourself on the opposite side of the Hollow from where you first started, with a group of platforms in front of you that offer a one-way ticket down to the start of the Middle Hollow and the Verdure Bridge. However, going down there now would cause to a miss a large optional area complete with a boss (but you can drop down early to grab the Shrine and warp back up if you want).",
