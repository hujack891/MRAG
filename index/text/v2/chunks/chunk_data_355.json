The first step to collecting the Elder Armourworm Spirit is to unlock the Zodiac Village. Fight the lightning dragon in the lake on the left side of the North Shore of the Bitter Lake to begin the quest. He will then ask you to visit the Xu Dog for medicine. Collect the medicine and bring it back to Chen Loong to complete the quest and unlock Zodiac Village. \n\n\n\nOnce unlocked, Zodiac Village is where you can find all of the 'shop' NCPs, like the Xu Dog, Shen Monkey, and a new blacksmith character named Yin Tiger. Chen Loong will also reside there. \n\nSpeak to Chen Loong and hand over an item called the Proto Armourworm. The Proto Armourworm will turn up in a small basket just above the seed baskets outside Chen Loong's hut. You need to feed the Proto Armourworm three Rice Cocoons to make it grow into a Spirit that you can absorb the next time you visit the village. \n\nYou can get Rice Cocoons from egg sacks throughout the Webbed Hollow!",
