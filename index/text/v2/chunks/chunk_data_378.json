This will take you to the nearest Keeper's Shrine, so let the light lead the way.\n\n  * **There are treasure chests and boxes to find along the way.** Some treasure chests are golden and obvious, while others are harder to find and look like wooden logs. On top of this, you'll find smaller boxes near altars where you can collect essential upgrade items, Gourds, Soaks, and more.\n\n  * **Look for gaps and holes in the walls.** It's not always easy to see all the hidden paths and places that you can explore in Black Myth: Wukong, but if you see a crack in the wall, it's worth investigating. Sometimes, these will lead you to hidden treasures, key items, and spirits that would otherwise be out of reach.\n\nLooking for more Black Myth: Wukong guides?
