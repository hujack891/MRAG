    "content": "In order to release the Shigandang from his prison, you'll need to search the Fright Cliff for six Buddha statue heads, and claim all six Buddha Eyeballs from them. You can find a detailed guide for All Buddha Eyeball Locations here, or check see the quick list below: \n\n  1. Located on the path up to the Squall Hideout Shrine.\n  2. To the left of the large cave entrance in the Squall Hideout area.\n  3. On top of a small ruin in the Squall Hideout area above a crevice.\n  4. On the opposite side of the crevice from the previous statue head along a main path.\n  5. At the very end of the large cave tunnel leading past the Mother of Stones to an outdoor platform.\n  6. Just ahead from the Rockrest Flat Shrine on the way to the boss arena.\n\n\n\nOnce you have all six Buddha Eyeballs (and have not defeated the Stone Vanguard on your own), you can interact with the large rock before engaging the Stone Vanguard to summon the Shigandang. \n\nThe Shigandang will immediately charge the Stone Vanguard, prompting a Yaoguai King Boss Battle that you get to watch (though you're still susceptible to their massive earthquake attacks)! \n\n\n\nThe Shigandang is a much stronger boss than the Stone Vanguard, though it will take a bit of damage in the scuffle. \n\n\n\nHowever, after losing around a fourth or more of its health, the Shigandang will most likely grab the Stone Vanguard and perform a devastating pile-driver slam, before flinging the Stone Vanguard aside as it breaks apart. \n\n\n\nThis will effectively defeat the Stone Vanguard for you, and you'll earn all the associated experience and item rewards, like the Sterness of Stone. \n\n\n\nThe bad news is that the Shigandang will immediately turn on you, and is an incredibly formidable foe. If you are defeated, the Shigandang will return to its buried spot when you reawaken at the nearby Shrine, allowing you to summon it again when you're ready to go one on one, and freely explore the Rock Crash Platform beyond the arena without having to defeat the Shigandang. \n\n  * ** Having trouble?
