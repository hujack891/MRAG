These come in the form of additional drinks, which you can consume on the fly, providing a host of different buffs and stat boosts. From removing elemental effects, boosting resistance, supercharging your health, or granting bonus damage, each one can change the tide of a fight or boss battle, provided you use it at the right time. \n\nMost of these consumables can also be crafted from the Shrine once you reach the Shen Monkey Vendor in Chapter 1 - Black Wind Mountain and the end of Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge and meet Xu Dog. Our walkthrough has a full breakdown of each of those areas.",
