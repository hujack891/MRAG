There’s no real block button to speak of in Wukong, so dodging — especially at the last second — is key to surviving combat encounters. \n\n\n\nOnce you’ve removed a fourth of his health bar, Erlang will vanish before trying to ambush from above.

Since you can’t really take lasting damage, you can simply try dodging around, or hold the L2 button to deflect them. \n\n\n\nWhen Erlang returns to the ground, it's also a good time to try out your spells early if you want, by holding R2 and then pressing one of the three button icons: \n\n  * The top button is **Rock Solid** , which acts like a parry that turns you into stone to deflect an incoming attack.\n  * The left button is **Immobilize** , which temporarily freezes your opponent in place allowing you to score free hits\n  * The bottom button is A **Pluck of Many** , which creates illusory copies of you to assist in combat.\n\n\n\nOnce nearly all his health is gone, a final scene will ensue, and as Sun Wukong transforms to fly off toward the forests, the Buddha’s magical circlet that Sun Wukong had been tricked into putting on flares, causing him to reel from an excruciating headache.
