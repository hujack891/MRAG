Our Old Rattle-Drum questline guide has everything you need to know, and you can also find a brief breakdown of the quest below: \n\nFrom the Windrest Hamlet Shrine, turn around and go back towards the Windrest Bridge Shrine. As you head through the gate at the bottom of the hill, take a left to find a small square area within the walls where you can use the drum. \n\n\n\nYou will know if you are in the right place, as the screen will go black and white and a young boy will start talking to you. \n\nHead back to the Valley of Despair Shrine. Go through the large gate. You will need the Keeness of Tiger and Sterness of Stone Key Items, which are along the main story path of this chapter and are unmissable. \n\nOn your right, you will see a small hut, which you can go under to enter a yard. In the yard, the boy will talk again, and you can use the drum. \n\n\n\nFinally, the last location is in Sandgate Village. From the Village Entrance Shrine, head through the gate you opened when you fought Earth Wolf in the large courtyard. You will have also seen the horseman here tied to a post. To the left of that post, where he was tied, is a small path leading to a well. \n\nHere you can use the drum and summon the boy who will lead you down into the well. \n\n\n\nIf you defeat the Mad Tiger down here, you will be able to open the chest and get yourself the Gourd. \n\nPlaguebane Gourd\n\nFor even more guides and tips on finding all the Gourd customisation items, be sure to check out our other guides.
