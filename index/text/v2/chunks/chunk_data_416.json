    "content": "The Flint Chief fight takes place on the lava, so you will want to get your hands on the Xiang River Goddess Gourd, which grants you temporary immunity from the lava after you use it. That way, you can fight without worrying about your health constantly depleting. \n\nYou can find the Xiang River Goddess Gourd in the chest-filled chamber you pass through on your way to fight the Elder Armourworm in the Webbed Hollow. \n\nThe Flint Chief fights like a combination of the Flint Vanguard and the other large, glowing rock enemies around the Valley. It does have appendages that it uses to kick or swipe at you, but most of its attacks will be delivered via the creature's huge, lava-infused head. These attacks hit hard, but since the Flint Chief is big, it's also rather slow, giving you enough time to dodge. \n\nImmobilize or A Pluck of Many speeds up the fight significantly if you don't have the Gourd yet.",
