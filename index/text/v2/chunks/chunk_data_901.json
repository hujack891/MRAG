As you make your way through the Webbed Hollow, you'll start to work toward the bottom of the area, past the Cliff of Oblivion. This is where you can find the Relief of the Fallen Loong, with the boss battle taking place nearby. \n\nDefeating him will reward you with a powerful Transformation Spell called Golden Lining, where you can become Yellow Loong and use his shock-infused long combo attacks.",
