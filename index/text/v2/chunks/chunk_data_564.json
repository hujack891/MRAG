This is a defensive spell that will allow you to stagger enemies and open up the possibility of performing counterattacks. \n\n\n\nYou'll need to wait until you reach Chapter 2 and have defeated the Tiger Vanguard at the Crouching Tiger Temple before you can unlock it. Slaying the Tiger Vanguard will automatically grant you the Rock Solid spell and let you turn your monkey into stone. \n\nOnce you have the spell, visit a Keeper's Shrine and select Self-Advance to see the option to Set Spells. Replace Cloud Step with Rock Solid, and you're ready to start parrying.",
