Each spot she hits will erupt with a bolt of lightning, so you'll need to avoid her charging body without rolling into these spots on accident, and be ready for a secondary charge from above as she does it again. \n\n\n\nCertain times, her slamming attacks to create lightning strikes can end with her making a quick spin to emit a blast of lightning from her mouth. She'll pivot slowly to spread the breath in front of her, but this can be avoided by gaining height using the Pillar Stance. \n\n\n\nIf she slams a claw into the ground without flying around, it means she'll drag that claw towards you, building up energy to send an electric shockwave in your direction, but it can be easily dodged to the side. \n\n\n\nHowever, this is just part one of her attack, as after a delay she will slam down with her tail for a massive attack -- but it can be deflected with Rock Solid. \n\nAfter her tail slam, you'll have the opportunity to retaliate and hit her tail before the boss can re-orient her body, so make the most of these moments to use Spirit Attacks while its on the ground. \n\n\n\nAnother wild tail slam attack will come when the boss rapidly spins in a front circle while facing you, building up momentum from several rotations to finally slam their tail down from above. \n\n\n\nBe wary when Kang-Jin Loong begins to roar and emit lightning all around, as they can perform an attack to summon a series of lightning strikes along the ground. They'll track your position, so keep strafing and dodging to outpace them, and don't worry about fighting while in this evasive mode. \n\n\n\nOther times, with a particularly loud roar, the boss will summon a giant circle of lightning strikes all around them. They only hit a few times in different spots, and usually at a fair distance from the boss, so pursuing it and keeping close is often the way to go. \n\nMuch of this fight is about patience and waiting for the right time to strike back, as you don't want to waste time swinging wildly when there's no hope of reaching the boss. Let them come to you, and look for the right moments with stationary claw swipes or tail slams to deflect with Rock Solid for a better chance to stagger them. \n\n\n\nUsing the Pillar Stance is a great bet for this fight since you'll have both increased height and range on your strikes even if your lock-on isn't on the exact right spot that might cause your Thrust Stance to miss.
