This is the highest rarity of Treasure and there is only one in the game. \n\n\n\nThe Gold Ridge Beast can be found in Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge within the secret Kingdom of Shahali area. It is located in a chest on the far side of the area. You must open this chest before you defeat Fuban as the area becomes inaccessible once the boss is defeated. \n\n\n\nA full walkthrough of how to access this area can be found below: \n\nBe sure to sell it at a vendor or the Shrine store as soon as you can. \n\nFor even more guides and tips on finding all the items in the game, be sure to check out our guide on all the Black Myth: Wukong Weapons locations and Armor and Gear locations, as well as the Gourds, Curios, Vessels, and Transformation Spells locations.
