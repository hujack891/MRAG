    "content": "The Flint Vanguard is a lava-rock copy of the Stone Vanguard you face in Yellow Wind Ridge. He has all the same attacks, but the battle is further complicated by his fire abilities and the horde of enemies that join the fight as well. \n\nThe Flint Vanguard is protected by a significant amount of Searing Fire and Scorching Fire enemies. These enemies make it extremely easy to get overwhelmed in this fight. A Pluck of Many can help you clear out some of the minions so you can focus on the Flint Vanguard itself. \n\nThe best way to fight this foe is by sticking behind it. The Flint Vanguard punches into the ground with its fists and has a sweeping attack that reaches either side of the beast, but both can be avoided by staying directly behind the creature.",
