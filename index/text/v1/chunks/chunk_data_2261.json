These poisonous pools deal Poison Bane to any enemies who make contact with them. They don't do any damage to you, though, so you don't have to worry about watching your step after the move is complete. If you do become poisoned for any other reason, however, the Elder Armourworm's equipped effect increases your Critical Hit Chance until the effect has worn off.",
