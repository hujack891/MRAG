As such, you’ll want to equip yourself with the best possible gear in Chapter 2 — you may even want to complete the chapter and return back from Chapter 3 if you find yourself unable to make a dent in this boss. Make sure you’re stocked up on medicines to help bolster your damage output and damage reduction.",
