If you already used the Old Rattle-Drum back in Windrest Hamlet, you’ll again hear the spirit of a boy call out to you. Use the drum here, and prepare to fend off the zombies as he speaks to you. Interestingly, he mentions a **secret and a well** before clamming up, giving you one final clue to the third location.",
