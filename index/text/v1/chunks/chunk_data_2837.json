He can perform some surprisingly agile lunging attacks, and his multi-hit sword swings can deal a lot of damage. Each of his combos end with a large downward slam, and gives you a wide opening to begin your counter-attack as he struggles to pull his blade out of the ground. For as tough as he is, he luckily won’t respawn when defeated.",
