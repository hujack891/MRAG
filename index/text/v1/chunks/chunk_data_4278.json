First, you will embody Misty Cloud and swing his giant log of incense at your enemies before switching over to Cloudy Mist and unleashing three beams of light to pelt them. These moves are very strong, especially considering there are two of them. The equipped effect is also handy if you frequently use Cloud Step. Channeling Misty Cloud and Cloudy Mist reduces the Mana cost of the spell, allowing you to use that and your other spells more before running out of Mana.",
