This will summon a horde of Rock Guai to burrow up out of the ground and launch themselves at you in a steady succession, exploding on impact. You’ll need to either backpedal and take evasive action, or use Cloud Step to get the slip on them. Be warned that as the last two make their leap attack, the Stone Vanguard will join in requiring you to time your evasion right.",
