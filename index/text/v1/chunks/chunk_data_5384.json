To uncover the well, you'll need to start off by finding and fighting Tiger's Acolyte in Windgate Village. He'll drop an Old Rattle-Drum which you can use in three spots across the chapter to uncover its secret. Once you've found all three and used the drum, a well will be revealed near Sandgate Village.
