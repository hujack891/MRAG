You can find a small gold pot at the base of the frozen falls here, but there are two Guardian Wolves overlooking it that you'll need to lure out and take care of first. Be wary you don't pull too far back down the frozen river and alert a Thunder Rhino Master on top of some rocks. After defeating them, open the pot to find a **Celestial Nonary Pill** to increase your stamina.",
