As an added bonus, all the Rat Archers posted on the gate’s roof have jumped down, and you can ambush the entire group. Your Sage’s Relic should now indicate an enemy who has a Spirit you can absorb, and sure enough you can spot a tougher Rat Archer than the rest with blue flames. Defeat him, and you’ll be able to absorb the Rat Archer Spirit. As an added bonus, all the Rat Archers will no longer spawn here!",
