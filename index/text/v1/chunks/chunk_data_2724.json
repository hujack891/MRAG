It will wipe these tornadoes out as soon as you use it, and mean there's one less thing to focus on. The deer will still leap in the air and tread the clouds to attack you, but you won't need to worry about being hit by the annoying tornadoes. While this is useful once, you'll obviously need to wait for it to become available again, and in the meantime, the deer will continue to use this attack.",
