Might will decay fairly quickly over time, and even more if you charge up the transformation’s focus bar to employ special spell attacks. For this particular spell, you’ll be able to use Guangzhi’s spinning light attacks, and charge a heavy attack for his quick dashes. With a full focus bar, you can use Might on spell after dodging to employ his powerful pogo jump attack!",
