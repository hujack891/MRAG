Grab the green Wisp nearby, and try to speak to him, only to learn he's apparently freezing to death.  \nLuckily, you have a spell to deal with this very predicament: Ring of Fire. If you don't have it currently equipped, just continue on the path going straight to find the Towers of Karma Shrine guarded by another Circus Monkey and his cohorts, and change your spells there after defeating them.",
