    "content": "The Bull Governor is armed with a giant, flaming halberd that he uses to stab, slash, and plunge into the ground to create a fiery explosion. He is a big enemy, meaning he is also rather slow, which works in your favor. The explosions can be tricky to dodge, however, especially considering there are other enemies around. The path to the Bull Governor is guarded by several other foes. Try to take them all out before taking on the Bull Governor so you can focus on him alone.",
