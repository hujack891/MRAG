Heavy Attacks work a bit differently here than in most other games: The more you land hits, the more your Focus bar in the bottom right corner grows. When it fills, you’ll gain a Focus Point, which allows you to add a Heavy Attack into your Light Attack Combos for massive damage. While you can still perform a Heavy Attack on its own, it will lack added punch without that Focus Point, and can’t be included in a combo attack without it.",
