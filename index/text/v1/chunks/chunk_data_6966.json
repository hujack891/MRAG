One of these changes includes the Great Sage's Broken Shell climbing to the top of his staff just like before, but this time, unleashing a flurry of projectiles. Tap dodge and roll to the side quickly to avoid this and build up focus while doing so. Then be prepared for him to slide down toward you, skim the water, and quickly dash back at you to try for another hit.",
