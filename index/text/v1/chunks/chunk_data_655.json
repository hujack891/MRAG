The reason for our recommendation is simply because there’s an odd flicker issue with fog and some other elements like rays that were often present at Medium, and bumping Visual Effects to High has a slight impact to your framerate, but not having the flicker makes it worth it. And you’re still seeing a 20% boost at High. If a flicker doesn’t bother you, Medium will see you net a 27% boost on performance.",
