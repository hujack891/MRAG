Near the entrance you came in through the large archway, there’s a large stone on the side, and on closer inspection has many heads carved into it. Draw close, and you’ll be able to interact with it, inserting the six Buddha Eyeballs you gained from the statue heads around the Fright Cliff. Doing so will unlock the Shigandang secret boss battle. It’s a much tougher fight than the Stone Vanguard, and we recommend saving it for the tail end of this chapter, either after you’ve cleared it or are close to doing so.",
