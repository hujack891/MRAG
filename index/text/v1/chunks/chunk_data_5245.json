Look just beyond the shrine for a small ditch running under a wooden bridge. You can explore the left side to find a sloping path up to a green Wisp to absorb, and where a mushroom is actually a Lingzhiling creature in disguise. Watch for its poisonous attacks, and kill it to earn a large variety of mushroom items. The ditch also leads below the town’s large gate, but aside from Fragrant Jade Flower to harvest, there’s not much else down here.",
