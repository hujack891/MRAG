By holding down the L2/LT button, you can move your staff quickly to deflect incoming arrows. The Wolf will usually begin with a barrage of quick arrow shots, so be sure to keep holding the button down rather than tapping it until he stops. The move costs stamina to maintain so you can’t block shots forever — as soon as the arrows stop flying, dash across and defeat him before he finds more arrows.",
