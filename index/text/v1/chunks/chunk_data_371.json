Still, when it does get close enough to strike, a well-timed Rock Solid deflection can send it crashing to the ground, and is useful to have for this fight. It can also use frozen winds to deal chilling attacks you should be ready for, so have warming medicine on hand or consider equipping a Curio that reduces frostbite, and consider trying the Ring of Fire to warm yourself up.",
