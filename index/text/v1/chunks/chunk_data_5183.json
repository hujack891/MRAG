It’s important to note that while you can face this boss once you find the required Key Item early in Chapter 2, you may want to wait until after completing Chapter 2, or even starting Chapter 3, due to the difficulty of this encounter. In particular, it’s a good idea to stock up on medicine to increase your shock resistance, and buy the Thunderbolt Horn Soak from the Shen Monkey as well.",
