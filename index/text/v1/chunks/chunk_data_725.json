Firstly, its Flaming Flint attack sees it continuously pummel the ground and enemies directly in front of it. This in itself deals quite a bit of damage, but as it attacks, it also builds Scorch Bane. If you can land enough attacks on an enemy, it will be inflicted with Burn Damage, helping you hugely by inflicting status damage for a short period of time while you continue to attack.",
