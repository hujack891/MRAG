This dead cart has already been dealt with by Ma Tianba the Horse Guai. He can be found in each chapter, but the interaction with him in the fifth chapter is important for unlocking a Transformation Spell. If you want to pick this up for yourself, **interact with the cart BEFORE you fight against Keeper of the Flaming Mountains**. After the Keeper of the Flaming Mountain boss fight, return to the cart and pull the string to get the Dark Thunder Transformation Spell.",
