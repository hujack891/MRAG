    "content": "The Red-Haired Yaksha is a relatively strong foe armed with a long-bow and flowing red hair. Most of his attacks are melee-based but he can shoot glowing projectiles out of both ends of his bow. The Red-Haired Yaksha is alone in the room where you fight him, so you can focus all your attention on him without having to worry about reinforcements. The Red-Haired Yaksha does wind up his moves, giving you enough time to predict and dodge them.",
