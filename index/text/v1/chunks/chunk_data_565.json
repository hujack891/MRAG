There is a poison frog, a thunder frog, a fire frog, an ice frog, and a stone frog. You won't know what frog you are going to get each time you use the move, but each frog has an excellent attack that deals a fair amount of damage. Channeling Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang also reduces the Stamina cost for Jumping, including Jump Attacks. The Jump Heavy Attack is a quick and effective way to land a strong hit, and this Spirit makes that move even less demanding.",
