Back in the cave, you can check the left wall to find another green Wisp to absorb, and note the golden trail of a nearby Shrine at another tunnel exit up ahead. It’s not a bad idea to activate and rest at this **Rockrest Flat Shrine** first, considering the quest we still have to finish the cave first that can be tough.",
