You're right above where you crossed the wooden beam, meaning the strange chamber you saw through the window is also right below you, and it houses a very important but optional Yaoguai Chief. Defeating him will be the key to unlocking the purple seals you've spotted all over this realm, but it's also worth pointing out that until you defeat the Yaoguai King of this area, you'll have to defeat this optional boss with the chanting curse sapping half your health at any point.",
