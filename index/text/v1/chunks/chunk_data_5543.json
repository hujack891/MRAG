He’ll start by lifting an arm and a leg, before slamming down on all fours to create a massive shockwave covering a large portion of the arena. All four of his limbs will glow, and soon after will cause a massive detonation. It is possible to avoid this with a well timed pillar stance to gain height on your staff, but you’ll need to do it away from his body or the initial blast can still knock you down or damage you regardless.",
