Non-Void can wield invisibility spells that shroud his form, leaving you only able to see his outline. He is invincible in this form. Non-Void can also scoop up the pages covering the floor of the temple and create a swirling vortex that deals damage if you get caught in it. Perfect Dodge before the paper cloud consumes you to avoid the myriad of paper cuts Non-Void wants to inflict on you.",
