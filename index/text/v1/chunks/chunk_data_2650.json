Bajie will explain to you that when this happens, it's best to wait until it spreads its wings again. Still, you should try to be as aggressive as you can while you have Bajie helping you in the first part of the fight. As always, try to reserve any Gourd usage while you have Bajie, as he'll often top up your health.",
