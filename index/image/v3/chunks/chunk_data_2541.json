After conquering a variety of bosses and obtaining Wukong's special armor, The Destined One is ready to complete his journey. Below, you'll find a Walkthrough of the final areas of Mount Huaguo as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* Water Curtain Cave**\n* Return Path**\n* Peak of Innocence**\n* Birthstone - Heart of Birthstone**\n* Stone Monkey\n* The Great Sage's Broken Shell\n## Birthstone - Heart of Birthstone\n### The Great Sage's Broken Shell Phase One\nThe Great Sage's Broken Shell will start this phase by dodging your attacks each time you try to complete combos. As these are perfect dodges, you'll see multiple illusions left behind in its wake, which will explode after a few seconds. To counter this, you'll want to land a few hits, and then jump back to avoid the explosions, but continue to follow up and complete the combos for a heavy attack.\n\nWe'd suggest throwing out the Plantain Fan as soon as the fight starts, to knock him back, and allow you to whittle his health down quickly before he even gets a chance to start. In terms of Transformations and Spirits, we found that Ebon Flow was useful for deflecting his attacks and quickly building might to perform a powerful finisher, and the Wandering Wight Spirit was able to take down a chunk of his health in one go.\n\nYou'll see the Great Sage's Broken Shell's version of a heavy attack, as the staff glows gold and he jumps up with his staff to smash it down on you. These moves can also be evaded, to help build up your own focus for a counterattack. Again, you'll want to take advantage of Wukong's arm and staff in this fight, by using the fourth focus point for heavy attacks, and making use of the increased Critical Hit Chance.\n\nWhen the Great Sage uses his variation of Pluck of Many, you'll see a duplicate appear as close as possible to you and will swing its staff. This will disappear after attacking, so you won't have to face multiple duplicates all at once.",
