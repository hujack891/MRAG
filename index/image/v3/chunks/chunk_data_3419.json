Though he’s not technically a snake, you will find yourself in danger of being poisoned during this fight, so you may want to buy a few anti-poison medicine from the Shrine’s shop.\n\nEasily the most annoying move in his repertoire is when he calls out to his “Boys”. He’ll then summon a number of poisonous snakes out of the ground all over the arena, who will all spit venom at you around 5-6 times before vanishing. While they technically do have health bar, it’s not worth engaging with any of them — giving you two viable options: Run and dodge like crazy, or find a corner of the arena where you can see them all, and use your staff spin to nullify the projectiles. This last trick won’t last forever due to the stamina drain, and also due to Guangmou’s meddling during the summons, but it can provide a temporary respite.",
