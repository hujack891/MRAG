You'll jump into this fight as soon as you finish against The Stone Monkey, and it's the final one needed to see the ending of the game.\n## The Great Sage's Broken Shell Boss Fight and Guide\nFor this fight, you can expect two phases as well. You'll essentially be going up against a better version of yourself, with access to fully unlocked skills and stances that are also available to you.\nHe'll use variations of **Vengeful Mirage, which leaves an exploding illusion behind, Rock Solid, Ring of Fire, and Pluck of Many**. On top of this, he'll use Smash, Pillar, and Thrust Stance attacks.\n### The Great Sage's Broken Shell Phase Two\nAt the start of this phase, the Great Sage will remove your relics from you, so you'll lose the buffs you selected when unlocking them. This is when you'll want to rely more on your Medicines, Curios, and Spells, especially Ring of Fire to build up your focus quickly. It can be much harder to hit him during this phase, so you'll need to play it somewhat safe to build up your focus.\nYou also need to be careful when using your Gourd at this stage. When you do, it's best to dodge to be safe but try to limit your use of it. This is because the Great Sage can Immobilize you and steal your Gourd for himself.\n\nLastly, you'll see him use the Somersault Cloud spell to zoom around the area, hit you, and dash off. He will try to grab you when using this, so it's important to learn the timings and roll away as often as possible.\n\nJust like the first phase, the key to this fight is attacking when you have your Focus Points built up and not trying to finish light combos. He'll typically interrupt them or use his perfect dodge to hurt you in the process, so it's best to wait until you can land those heavy attacks. It's also important to note him during his Rock Solid phase! Otherwise, you'll see the Destined One kicked around by the Great Sage's duplicates.",

Don't forget to throw out the Plantain Fan as soon as it's ready each time, as well, as this is one of the best ways to attack him undisturbed.\n\nOnce the fight is over, The Great Sage's Broken Shell will be vanquished, and a cutscene will begin. The Great Sage will stumble in the water and the relics will leave his body as golden orbs.\n\nEach one will land inside the Destined One as the Great Sage crumbles, and his crown lands in the water. As the Old Monkey appears again, he'll place the crown upon the Destined One's head and finish the tale of Sun Wukong.",
