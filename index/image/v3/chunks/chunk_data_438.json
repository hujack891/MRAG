Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Valley Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Flint Chief\n* Yaoguai Chief - Cloudy Mist, Misty Cloud\n* **Rakshasa Palace**\n* **The Emerald Hall**\n* Yaoguai King - Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and Yin-Yang Fish\n* Yaoguai Chief - Crimson-Silver Cart\n## The Emerald Hall\nFrom The Emerald Hall Keeper's Shrine, go left and up the stairs. A cutscene will start to play, where you'll transform into a Cicada and fly toward the center of the hall. This is where you'll find Pingping speaking to her mother, Rakshasi, accompanied by the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains.\nAfter they discuss The Destined One obtaining the relics, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains offers to care for Rakshashi, which Pingping protests. After he binds Pingping, Rakshashi is revealed to be Zhu Bajie transformed and it's time to take on the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains for yourself.\n### Missable Transformation Spell\nAs we mentioned earlier, at the start of Furnace Valley there is a dead cart. You need to pull the string and exhaust the dialogue from the horse guai Ma Tianba before you defeat him in this fight. Otherwise, you will miss out on the Dark Thunder Transformation Spell. Once you've beaten the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and the Yin-Yang Fish, return to the cart and pull the string to get the Transformation Spell.\n\nTurn and face away from the altar. There are two places you'll want to go here to get collectibles. First, head to the stairs, but take the small path down to the right. Follow this to find a golden turtle, where you can get the Slumbering Beetle Husk.",
