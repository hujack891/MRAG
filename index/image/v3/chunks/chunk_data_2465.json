    "img_above_text": "# Violet Hail (Transformation)\nThe Violet Hail Transformation in Black Myth: Wukong is quite well-hidden, located behind a secret boss within the secret area of Purple Cloud Mountain in The Webbed Hollow.\nTransformation Spells are key to succeeding in harder fights, and the Violet Hail Transformation lets you transform into a worm guai, immune to Poison and inflicting Poison Bane on the enemy with each attack. The Violet Hail's moveset is as follows:\n* **Light Attack: Slash - Infest the enemy with the eggs on your blade.** As the Violet Hail, your attacks do damage through the eggs on your blade as the creature. This infests your enemies, dealing sustained damage with several attacks.\n* **Charged Heavy Attack: Self-Torment - Imbue the blade with eggs by self-wounding.** This is a rather unique attack, focused on stacking damage with several light attacks. Each time you imbue, you can stack sacks of eggs on the blade, which are then offloaded onto enemies with each attack, dealing damage to them.\n* **Spell: Hive Mind - Manually command infested larvae to explode, dealing severe damage.** This attack allows you to offload all the damage you have built up with your light attacks and charged heavy attacks.\n* **Spell: Self-Detonation - Upon self-detonation, deals area damage upon triggering de-transform.** This is a standard detonation upon manually exiting the Transformation. The damage infests enemies.\n## Black Myth: Wukong Violet Hail Transformation Location\nThe Violet Hail Transformation can be found in Purple Cloud Mountain within The Webbed Hollow. To reach this area, you will need to defeat the Venom Daoist twice - once in the Pool of Shattered Jade and then at the Court of Illumination at the Temple of Yellow Flowers in the chapter. This will open up Purple Cloud Mountain via the mural nearby. In Purple Cloud Mountain, you will need to then defeat Doaist Mi\") within the village at the Petalfall Hamlet Shrine.\n\nWith the item, you can then take it back to Daoist Mi and fight him. Upon his defeat, he will give you the Transformation. Despite his imposing form, he is a complete pushover, really. For a full breakdown of his attacks, be sure to check out our Daoist Mi boss page.",
