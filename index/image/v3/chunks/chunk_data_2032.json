He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).\nAs mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses.\n\nHe'll then start coming for you while burrowed, which you can see by the disturbed earth heading in your direction. As lightning strikes, he'll leap out in an unblockable grab that deals major damage, and the timing can prove fairly difficult to dodge when you can't see or target him. We recommend running away while panning the camera behind you, and the exact moment you see a larger lightning strike behind you, dodge forward to avoid him as he bursts upward.",
