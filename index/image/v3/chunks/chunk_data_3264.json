While he doesn’t have many moves, they can often land extremely quickly, which means you’ll need to be ready to dodge at any moment.\n\nHis most standard attack includes a series of swipes with both arms that sends him forward, ending in a small leaping splash attack that allows him to reposition. By dodging the first swipe to the side, you can wait for him to leap back towards you and then use Immobilize to keep in place while you attack. He can also use any of these swipes and slams independently as well as in a three-hit combo, so look for a follow-up attack before deciding to commit to countering with your own attacks.",
