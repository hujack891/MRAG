If you listen to the headless man’s song, he’ll offer a clue: To beat the yellow rat sage who rules this place, you’ll need to defeat his henchmen who carry the keys to this door.\n\nFrom here, things can get pretty varied and more open than the paths were in Chapter 1. To the right of the sealed door is a bridge leading to the Fright Valley (plus a Ginsengling you can beat up to harvest its plants).
