He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\n\nKeep building up your Focus with light combos by chasing him down and using Immobilize to keep him from teleporting away, and use any lulls in his projectile attacks to rack up damage, and then unleash a charged pillar or thrust attack before he can escape.",
