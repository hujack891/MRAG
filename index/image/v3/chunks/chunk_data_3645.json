You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive.

Even a full Light Combo can send him stumbling backward, which you can mix in with a varied combo and follow up from the Smash Stance, stagger his sword swings with Rock Solid, and use a bulky Spirit attack like the Second Rat Prince to send him sprawling again and again and limit his ability to attack back.",
