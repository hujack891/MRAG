This boss has a speciality - and it’s creating blood. Lots of it. This blood can be pretty dangerous too, as he’ll be able to create pools of it all around the arena, and even poison you with it, so make sure you’re stocked on a few antimiasma pills.\n\nIf you see him begin to lean back and shake his staff over his head, prepare for him to create several more blood projectiles to shoot out of the eyes on his back. They’ll track your position and fly in an arc towards you, so be ready to dodge or employ your staff spin to destroy the projectiles before they can poison you.",
