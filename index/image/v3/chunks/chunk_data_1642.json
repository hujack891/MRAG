Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of Yellow Wind Ridge: Sandgate Village, as well as how to defeat its many bosses that include Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, the Earth Wolf, the King of Flowing Sands and his First and Second Rat Princes.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Village Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* Yaoguai Chief - Earth Wolf\n* Yaoguai Chief - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n* **Valley of Despair**\n* Yaoguai Chief - First Prince of Flowing Sands\n## Village Entrance\nMake sure to take the time to view the new additions to the Chapter 2’s Shrines menu. Note that you can still freely fast travel back to any Shrine in Chapter 1’s Black Wind Mountain if you missed out on any secrets. The store is also selling very different items than it was in the previous chapter, and you’ll find that the selection will change based on which chapter you are in:\nYellow Wind Ridge Shrine Shop\n---\nAntimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |\nMind Core (x2) - 720 Will | Silk (x2) - 600 Will | Yaoguai Core (x2) - 450 Will |\nLicorice (x5) - 120 Will | Aged Ginseng (x5) - 90 Will | Fragrant Jade Flower (x5) - 120 Will | Purple Lingzhi (x5) - 90 Will\nFire Bellflower (x5) - 120 Will | Jade Lotus (x5) - 90 Will | |\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Earth Wolf\nThis strange looking yaoguai has a lot of rushing attacks that are hard to get a sense of due to its attack patterns, and you’ll want to utilize your Immobilize spell for help interrupting these when possible.\n\nHeading to the left of the lone shack, you’ll find a gate guarded by a Rat Governor and another Archer on the rooftops that connects to the one you climbed earlier. Defeat them to gain access to a large open field inside the Village’s main area. From across the field, a voice pleading to be freed calls out, but in your way is a large loping creature that will want to engage you first.",
