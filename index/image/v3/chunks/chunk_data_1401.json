As such, you’ll want to equip yourself with the best possible gear in Chapter 2 — you may even want to complete the chapter and return back from Chapter 3 if you find yourself unable to make a dent in this boss. Make sure you’re stocked up on medicines to help bolster your damage output and damage reduction.\n\nAnd if the rage-filled roars and resulting deadly attacks weren’t bad enough, the Mad Tiger also has a secret grab. It seems to happen most often in retaliation for getting staggered, causing him to fall to his knees placing one hand on the ground. As he rises, he’ll do so with a quick leap toward you, landing with a quick uppercut.",
