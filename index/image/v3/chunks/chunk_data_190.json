Below, you'll find a Walkthrough of the first major area of Mount Huaguo as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Verdant Path**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Supreme Inspector\n* Yaoguai Chief - Jiao-Loong of Waves\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 1\n* Yaoguai Chief - Feng-Tail General\n* **Rhino Watch Slope**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 2\n* Yaoguai Chief - Gold Armored Rhino\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Baw-Baw\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 3\n* **Deer Sight Forest**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Cloudtreading Deer\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 4\n* Yaoguai Chief - Water-Wood Beast\n* **Mantis-Catching Swamp**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Emerald-Armed Mantis\n* Yaoguai Chief - Son of Stones\n* Yaoguai King - Giant Shigandang\nThe beginning of Chapter 6 is a linear path, so proceed down the slope from where you spawn. As you make your way along this road, you'll be intercepted by the last of the Lesser Yoaguais you need to complete your journal.\n## Mantis-Catching Swamp\nNow that you've cleaned up the majority of the optional bosses, it's time to find the last of the main bosses. You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis.\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Son of Stones\nLand behind the Sone of Stones on the cliff and then attack to start the fight. He won't immediately jump up, so you can get a couple of free hits in.\n\nWhen the Sone of Stones is down, there's just one more boss to take care of, which is a secret Yoaguai King. To be able to summon it, you'll need to have collected the Skandhas through the previous Chapters. If you haven't already got your hands on these Skandhas, follow our guide to collecting them all here.\n\nGo to the clearing behind where you fought the Son of Stones, just off to the left. You'll see some water, a large rock to the left of it, and two golden trees on either side of the rock.\n\nYou want to go to the right of the water to find the secret area that will take you to the hidden boss.",
