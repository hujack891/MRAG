    "img_above_text": "# Plaguebane Gourd\nThe Plaguebane Gourd is a unique Gourd in Black Myth: Wukong in that it offers an effect focused entirely around not refilling your health. The Rare Gourd comes with the bonus of halving your health recovery when using it, but your attack is increased for a short duration.\nThis makes it a great Gourd for those looking to play risky, when compared to the other Gourds in the game, as the attack boost is quite potent. The Gourd only has five uses and can't be upgraded.\n## Black Myth: Wukong Plaguebane Gourd Location\nThe Plaguebane Gourd can be found in in the chest after defeating the Mad Tiger boss in Yellow Wind Ridge. It requires you to defeat the Tiger Acolyte and obtain the Old Rattle-Drum Key Item.\nTo get the Old Rattle Drum, you will have to enter the Windrest Hamlet in the Yellow Sand Formation area and the head to three specific locations around the area, following a boy's voice. Our Old Rattle-Drum questline guide has everything you need to know, and you can also find a brief breakdown of the quest below:\nFrom the Windrest Hamlet Shrine, turn around and go back towards the Windrest Bridge Shrine. As you head through the gate at the bottom of the hill, take a left to find a small square area within the walls where you can use the drum.\n\nFinally, the last location is in Sandgate Village. From the Village Entrance Shrine, head through the gate you opened when you fought Earth Wolf in the large courtyard. You will have also seen the horseman here tied to a post. To the left of that post, where he was tied, is a small path leading to a well.\n\nHere you can use the drum and summon the boy who will lead you down into the well.",
