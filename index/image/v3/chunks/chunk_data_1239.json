Taking double damage from any of his attacks is highly inadvisable, so make sure your Shock-Quelling Powder is on your quickbar for this fight.\nYellowbrow chiefly attacks with a large spiked mace while he holds his magic seedbag in the other hand. Be incredibly wary of his weapon, as it has the ability to change its shape, and he can extend the handle at will both in size, length, and flexibility.\n\nOnce he gets to around half his health or less, be especially prepared for his ultimate attack. He'll usually begin by proclaiming that he will \"meet you in combat, devoid of any relics\", and charge his weapon above his head, drawing in a much large amount of crackling energy above his head and motes all around.",
