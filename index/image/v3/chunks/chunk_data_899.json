    "img_above_text": "# King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\nThe King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince are a required Yaoguai Chief miniboss that you can encounter in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong. As a required boss fight, you'll encounter them blocking the path leading out of the Sandgate Village, connecting to both the Fright Cliff and Crouching Tiger Temple.\n* Rewards: Pungent Flesh Chunk, Second Rat Prince Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Yaoguai Core x2, Silk x2, Stone Spirit x1, 1102 Experience, 1014 Will\n## King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\nThere’s one very important thing to get out of the way before discussing the rest of the fight. Despite the name, the Rat King of Flowing Sands is not your true target, and in reality you can complete this battle as soon as you defeat his son, the Second Rat Prince. However, if you choose to engage in regicide yourself, know that the prince will become enraged at the death of his father, and will gain a massive damage increase with empowered moves. But for all this risk, there is a reward — defeating the empowered Rat Prince will allow you to absorb his Spirit to use in attacks, which you **can’t gain otherwise**!\nWhen the battle begins, you’ll notice that the King wisely does not try to fight you up close. He’ll scurry behind his son and out of sight while the Second Rat Prince tries to hold your attention with massive swings from his spiked mace. The King can even burrow underground, creating a trail of flying dirt as he tries to evade you.\n\nExpect his swings to hit harder and move faster, often hitting twice in a row in quick succession. If he jumps through the air past you, he’ll often go for a lunging sweeping strike that sends him sliding back past you, but gives you the opportunity to dodge alongside his strike to hit him where he ends up.",
    "img_below_text": "Another terrifying new move is for him to do a slow spin ending with a weapon toss right at you. He’ll quickly follow up with a leaping dive attack to reach his mace, and then pull it out of the ground and swing it forth, which should quell any thoughts of trying to attack at this point.\n\nIdeally, the lower you have his health before killing his father, the less time you’ll have to worry about this phase if you can rush him down. If you don’t kill his dad, he’ll scurry off as soon as the Second Prince falls. If not, you’ll be able to help yourself to the Second Prince’s Spirit, as well as a Pungent Flesh Chunk.",
