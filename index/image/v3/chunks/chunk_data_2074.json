He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).\nAs mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses.\n\nHe can also hold his sword high up above him while charging it with lightning strikes. After a delay, he'll begin slashing the air in your direction, unleashing a low projectile wave followed by a diagonal slash wave, and then charge up his sword before jabbing it ahead to send a beam of lightning straight at you. It's better to keep your distance the moment you see him charging up, then dodge the three blasts before moving back in to fight.",
