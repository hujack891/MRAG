Though the boss has two phases, you may not have as much trouble as you did with The Scorpionlord, since you won't have to deal with poison, and their attacks are a bit easier to read and counter. Strangely enough, it also starts the fight at around 75% of its health, but it does have a second health bar waiting, so pacing yourself can be the key to this fight.\n\nThe Duskveil can also raise its hoof up while pivoting slightly, in which case it will perform a swift kick instead that drags along the ground. It will follow with two slow sweeps of its arms in both directions that need only be dodged once each, or you can use Rock Solid to knock it back.",
