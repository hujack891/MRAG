With multiple entrances and exits to this area, we’ll start with the first Shrine on the other side of the Crouching Tiger Temple.\n## Windseal Gate\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Gore-Eye Daoist\nThe Gore-Eye Daoist is not like most bosses you’ve faced, what with the creepy fleshy thing on his back full of eyeballs. This boss has a speciality - and it’s creating blood. Lots of it. This blood can be pretty dangerous too, as he’ll be able to create pools of it all around the arena, and even poison you with it, so make sure you’re stocked on a few antimiasma pills.\n\nUnfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there. You can interact with the well to drop down to a secret area, where you’ll face off against an incredibly tough and dangerous Mad Tiger Miniboss (who may even be tougher than all the other Tigers you’ve faced)!\n\nReturning to the second spot you played the Rattle-Drum in Yellow Wind Formation, cross the rope bridge and you’ll contend with a few more Weasel Captains.\n\nRounding the corner, you can spot a large tree in the distance with telltale glow of a collectible hanging from it, but guarding it is a very creepy and unique miniboss.",
