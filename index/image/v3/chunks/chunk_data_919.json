While he has much in common with the other optional frog boss from Black Wind Mountain, he’s got a few new attacks you’ll need to prepare for.\n\nSeveral of its new electric attacks can deal a flurry of damage if you aren’t prepared to deal with them. The usual tell will be when the frog’s throat swells with electric energy. He will then shoot out dozens of electrified tadpoles — sometimes in a large frontal arc around him, and sometimes he’ll just spew them out and have them scatter around him.",
