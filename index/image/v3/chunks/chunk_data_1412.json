He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\n\nDodging them will be extremely difficult, so instead swap to your Pillar Stance and extend off the floor (preferably in range of the Captain) and start charging up as you evade the floor lasers. Once they perform a second sweep, launch your attack the captain.",
