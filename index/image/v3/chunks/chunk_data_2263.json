The most important thing to note is the smaller bar above his health bar: Non-White can use his blade to repeatedly block and parry your attacks, which can at times effectively give him a second health bar. Finding the right times to strike can be useful in circumventing his defenses, but you'll want to be wary of his frost and poison attacks. Stock up on both Antimiasma and Body-Warming medicine to deal with both scenarios should they arise.",
