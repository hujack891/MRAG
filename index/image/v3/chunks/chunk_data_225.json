    "img_above_text": "# Best Skills to Unlock\nThere are a huge number of skills to unlock in Black Myth Wukong, and it can be daunting to know where to begin. Though the game helps by limiting the skills trees you can first interact with, there is still a wide variety of skills to choose from. With so many choices, choosing which skills to unlock can be daunting, but our guide is designed to help you decide which skills to unlock.\n**Jump to:**\n* How to Unlock Skills in Black Myth: Wukong\n* How to Understand the Early Game Skills Trees\n* How to Understand the Mid-to-Late Game Skills Trees\n* Best Foundation Skills to Unlock\n* Best Staff Stances Skills to Unlock\n* Best Mysticism Skills to Unlock\n* Best Alteration Skills to Unlock\n* Best Strand Skills to Unlock\n* Best Transformations Skills to Unlock\n## How to Understand the Early Game Skills Trees\nAt the beginning of the game, you’ll see that there are locked branches of the skill tree and you’ll only have access to **Foundation, Staff Stances, and Mysticism**.\nThe Foundation section of the skills is divided into Stamina, Martial Arts, and Survival. In these skill trees, you’ll be able to awaken abilities that will reduce your stamina consumption, increase your health, and upgrade your standard attacks.\n\nStaff Stances comprise Smash Stance, Pillar Stance, and Thrust Stance, **though the latter can’t be unlocked until you reach level 20**. Smash Stance is your starting stance, and Pillar Stance can be unlocked by awakening the first node in the corresponding Skill Tree.\n\nOn the left-hand side of the Staff Stances tab, you’ll also find uncategorized skills. The ones closest to the Smash Stance set will increase your health recovery, the damage you deal, and the stamina you recover.\n\nMeanwhile, the ones on the far left will **automatically unlock** as you sink more points into Staff Stances. These will give additional Focus Points, to a total of four, and are also required for you to be able to unlock skill points from the skill tree further down.",
