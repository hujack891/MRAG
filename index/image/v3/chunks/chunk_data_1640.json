While he has much in common with the other optional frog boss from Black Wind Mountain, he’s got a few new attacks you’ll need to prepare for.\n\nAt the top of the hill is one last shack, where you’ll find a big chest holding a **Blood of the Iron Bull** , 1 **Small Piece of Gold** , and 4 **Tiny Piece of Gold**.
