Be ready to dodge the third slam, and then immediately begin a combo attack while it struggles to rise up again.\n\nThe Centipede Guai can also perform two slow frontal sweeps with its main claws, alternating a claw on each side, but with its fairly slow swings you can step to the side to focus on its legs.",
