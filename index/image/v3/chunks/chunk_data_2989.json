Hiding across several rope bridges outside the middle of the Webbed Hollow, this boss can't be activated until you obtain a Key Item in the previous chapter. Yellow Loong is the final of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n* Rewards: Golden Lining Transformation Spell, Sea-Supporting Tendon, Golden Carp Curio, Kun Steel, Loong Pearl, Mind Core, 6998 Experience, 5049 Will\n## Yellow Loong Boss Fight and Guide\nThe Yellow Loong is the last of the four Loong bosses, and rather appropriately, he's an incredibly challenging fight. In fact, you may want to attempt this optional fight later on, especially after you've completed the rest of Chapter 4 and gotten tougher armor sets and weapons before challenging him. While he doesn't have a huge moveset, the attacks he does can some fast, and when imbued with lightning can often kill you before you're able to react.\nIf you do challenge him early, you should really consider arming yourself to the teeth: Upgrade the Loongscale Armor to reduce shock duration, stock up on every medicine you can think of in addition to Shock-Quelling Powder, and ask the Xu Dog for extra pills that may include rare ones that give you boosts of health or damage increases. Such a powerful foe is deserving of your good consumables -- but you may want to practice a bit first before using them in battle.\n\nThe other way to stop him is to let him charge up, but then immediately shift into Rock Solid the second he releases the blast and flies at you for his initial swipe. It's this attack and this one only that will completely knock the wind out of him, and stop him from performing the rest of his dive-bombs and slams, which will not stagger him if you try deflecting those.\n\nEven outside this new attack of his, the last half of the fight will be even deadlier as he follows up many of his basic attacks with more sweeps and spins than before.",
