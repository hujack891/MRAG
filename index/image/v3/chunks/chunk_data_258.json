Though the game helps by limiting the skills trees you can first interact with, there is still a wide variety of skills to choose from. With so many choices, choosing which skills to unlock can be daunting, but our guide is designed to help you decide which skills to unlock.\n**Jump to:**\n* How to Unlock Skills in Black Myth: Wukong\n* How to Understand the Early Game Skills Trees\n* How to Understand the Mid-to-Late Game Skills Trees\n* Best Foundation Skills to Unlock\n* Best Staff Stances Skills to Unlock\n* Best Mysticism Skills to Unlock\n* Best Alteration Skills to Unlock\n* Best Strand Skills to Unlock\n* Best Transformations Skills to Unlock\n## How to Understand the Mid-to-Late Game Skills Trees\nWhen you hit level 20 and beyond, you'll start to unlock even more of the Skills Trees. By the end of Chapter 2/start of Chapter 3, you can have all of the Skills tabs unlocked (as long as you've explored thoroughly and taken down optional bosses). This will grant you the Alteration, Strand, and Transformations skills.\nAlteration applies to spells like Cloud Step and Rock Solid and will improve the health of your decoy, movement speed, and unlock the chance to deflect attacks with a parry.\nThe Transformations menu applies to any Transformation spells you collect and you'll find skills to improve might recovery, maximum health when transformed, increased defense, and more.\n### Best Mysticism Skills to Unlock\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Stagnation**|  Extends duration of Immobilization on next attack (Stacks up to 5-10 times)\n**Evanescence**|  When enemies attack after being Immobilized, the duration increases along with the damage they take\n**Raging Flames**|  Focus generates each second you're within the Ring of Fire\n**Consolidation**|  Slowly recover health while in the Ring of Fire.\nYou'll unlock Mysticism early on and be able to use Immobilize to stop enemies in their tracks. Skills like Stagnation, where you extend the duration of Immobilization the next time you use the spell are invaluable especially as they stack.\nTeam this with Evanescence and you can extend the Immobilization once again, but also increase the damage they take once they try to attack. The goal for this category should be to try and do as much damage as possible and have the spell last as long as you can.\n\nAlong with the suggested skills, we'd suggest unlocking skills that will allow you to complete combos without interruption, with more attack power on finishers, and those that build focus quickly.",
