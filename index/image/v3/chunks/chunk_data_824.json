You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive. You should also have the Loongwreathe or Kang-Jin Staff, and have a good set of spells equipped that compliment your attacks -- we reccomend Immobilize and Rock Solid, but you can also try using the Ring of Fire to buff yourself up in since the arena is small.\nThe Cyan Loong doesn't have a huge amount of attacks, but when they hit, they hit hard!\n\nThe good news is with his form only slightly bigger than yours, the Cyan Loong is fairly susceptible to being staggered. Even a full Light Combo can send him stumbling backward, which you can mix in with a varied combo and follow up from the Smash Stance, stagger his sword swings with Rock Solid, and use a bulky Spirit attack like the Second Rat Prince to send him sprawling again and again and limit his ability to attack back.",
