You’ll need to be well prepared to take him down, and make sure you have the best armor and weapons crafted. If you haven’t been using them much before, now is also an excellent time to invest in crafting consumable medicines. Items like the Evil Repelling Medicament to reduce incoming damage, and the Tiger Subduing Pellets to increase your own.\n\nHowever, if he starts with a right hook and then a delayed forward moving punch with his left, he’ll always follow up with a quick leg sweep as he bounds away to safety, making it an unwise move to try and counter, unless you’re playing things safe with a long-ranged jab from the Thrusting Stance.",
