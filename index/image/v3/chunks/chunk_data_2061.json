Below you'll find a guide for the final area of The Webbed Hollow, including how to track down the Violet Spider and defeat the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, as well as getting a rematch with the Venom Daoist to unlock a Secret Area, and finding the last Purple Talisman Altar.\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Mountain Trail**\n* **Forest of Ferocity**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Commander Beetle\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Fungiwoman\n* Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n* **Court of Illumination**\n* Boss Fight - Supreme Inspector\n* Yaoguai King - Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master\nAfter defeating the Violet Spider, you'll have to escape her spider swarm as she retreats, but luckily you'll be plucked to safety by the one Spider Sister that seems to be on your side.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master\nThe first time you approach this boss fight, you'll see the depths of the depraved power the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master possesses as he absorbs the Violet Spider into his being against her will. He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).\nAs mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses.\n\nWhen the battle begins, the Violet Spider's daughters will launch into battle and try to battle with the Hundred-Eyed Daoist. You should absolutely use this period to help them out whenever possible and get your own hits in until the spiders are all defeated, but don't worry too much if you end up dying your first attempt. Even though the Spider Sisters won't reappear for subsequent attempts, The boss health bar will be permanently lowered by 15%, which is a pretty big boon to work with.\n\nOddly enough, there's actually two small areas on either side of the arena you can't reach the first time due to the cutscene, but can explore before attacking him on subsequent attempts. To the right, you'll find some Daoists guarding a **Treasure Chest** with materials, and on the left you'll find a small pathway leading to the side of the arena with a green Wisp to absorb.",
