The Wandering Wight will regularly end his series of explosions by rapidly moving his hands and charging up before blasting an energy wave directly at you.

Make the most of it by unleashing quick combos and continuing to dodge his strikes and build up Might, and then perform a special spell with a full Might bar by dodging an attack and then using the heavy attack button to perform an explosive pogo jump to take off a huge piece of his health!\n\nExpect this boss to take some time to defeat, as you can easily fall to any number of his attacks while you learn the timing to his sweeping spin attacks, hand blast, and earthquake tremors. Keep a watch on your stamina to know when to pull back and recharge, and use lulls in combat to replenish health when out of range of his earthquake.\n\nWhen the Wandering Wight finally falls, you’ll get the Cat’s Eye Beads Curio to equip for a passive bonus, as well as a Stone Spirit material and 691 Will.",
