Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n* Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n* Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Yellowbrow\nNo longer the small chubby monk you've seen previously, this much larger giant of a man is an incredibly dangerous and formidable foe, and uses a host of lightning attacks to try and inflict Shock status on you. Taking double damage from any of his attacks is highly inadvisable, so make sure your Shock-Quelling Powder is on your quickbar for this fight.\nYellowbrow chiefly attacks with a large spiked mace while he holds his magic seedbag in the other hand. Be incredibly wary of his weapon, as it has the ability to change its shape, and he can extend the handle at will both in size, length, and flexibility.\n\nIf he slams his mace straight into the ground directly in front of him with the handle up, back off and wait for him to charge it up. He'll slide it along the ground in a sweep around him, which will then send out a shockwave you'll either want to jump or Pillar Stance over (just make sure you're out of range of his sweep when you do).",
