It is one of the Gourds in the game that has the most uses by default: 8 to be exact. Unfortunately, it can't be upgraded beyond this at the Shen Monkey Vendor, but it is still incredibly strong late in the game.\nUsing the Gourd grants a moderate amount of Burn Resistance, ensuring you can't have your health peeled away by fire attacks. You also gain immunity from lava-covered terrain for a short duration. This makes the Gourd incredibly useful in Chapter 5, within The Flaming Mountains.\n## Black Myth: Wukong Xiang River Goddess Gourd Location\nThe Xiang River Goddess Gourd can be found within The Verdure Bridge Shrine location in The Webbed Hollow.
