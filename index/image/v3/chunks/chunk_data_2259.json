With it, you can transform into the Macaque Chief, become immune to Frost, and wield a longsword that unleashes Frost Bane. The Focus built up before a transformation can also be converted for use afterwards.\nTo find the Umbrall Abyss Transformation, you will need to explore the majority of The New West, which is easily the largest area in the game. The Umbral Abyss Transformation's moveset is:\n* **Light Attack: Sprouting Spring - Perform consecutive slashes to build up Focus** \\- This is a standard set of slashes that builds up focus, with the final one doing more damage.\n* **Heavy Attack: Withering Winter - Slower in movement, but heavier in damage, this move builds up Focus faster**. - This is a strong slash that deals significant damage but is very slow compared to other attacks.\n* **Spell: Cold Heart - Perform Cold Heart to empower yourself**. This is a strong enchantment that allows you to deal more damage with your blade slashes, and dodge easier thanks to turning into clouds and mist.\n## Black Myth: Wukong Umbral Abyss Location\nThe Umbral Abyss Transformation Spell can be obtained from the Mahavira Hall Shrine in New Thunderclap Temple in The New West. From the Shrine, head up into the large temple and defeat Yellowbrow and then the Macaque Chief for the final time.",
