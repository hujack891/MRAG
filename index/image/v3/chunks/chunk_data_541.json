Though he’s not technically a snake, you will find yourself in danger of being poisoned during this fight, so you may want to buy a few anti-poison medicine from the Shrine’s shop.\n\nWhen he’s got some range on you, listen up for some of his call-outs. If he yells “Storm forth!” he’ll soon create a gusty orb surrounded by leaves that will slowly float toward you. This one can’t be deflected since it won’t do damage on its own. Once it reaches your position, the gust will issue forth and in a moment become a small violent tornado that will knock you down!",
