    "img_below_text": "A good tactic to employ for this fight is to use the Thrust Stance’s retreating move after a combo when his sand comes out, and then follow up with a heavy thrust attack at range. It will move you out of the blinding sand, and also away from most of his claw swipe attacks. Without the sand masking his moves, he’s not overly tough, and you’ll be able to best him in this duel.\n\nUpon defeat, he’ll relent and offer to let you join him in exploring the Realm of Gold together, before vanishing off behind the giant gate. You’ll also earn the Snout Mask head gear, which has an interesting effect on raising and lowering attack power based on gourd use.\n\nOnce you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into Chapter 2’s Secret Area: The Kingdom of Sahali.",
