While you may recognize a good number of his moves, you'll soon find that he's also been infused with a lot of frost power, and can quickly chill and render you immobile before dealing a killing blow. As such, having chill-resistant items and curios will be of great help here.\n\nNow that you've dealt with the Yaoguai Chief, you can explore this large size plaza. Up ahead, you'll find several Overseeing Monks praying to a Turtle General statue and three more practicing punching a large tree (you can sidestep them and keep on the main path if you wish since they won't notice you unless you draw close).",
