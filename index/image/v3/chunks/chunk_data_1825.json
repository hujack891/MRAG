Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of The New West: Snowhill Path, as well as how to win your first encounter with Macaque Chief, and defeat the mighty Kang-Jin Loong.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Frost-Clad Path**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n* **Mirrormere**\n* Yaoguai Queen - Kang-Jin Loong\nIn Black Myth Wukong's third chapter, the Destined One will travel far from the arid deserts to the snowy mountaintops of The New West, where you'll spy an odd character masquerading as a statue.\nOnce you've taken off your own disguise, you'll find yourself in a frozen cave full of giant statues with only one way forward. That way is blocked by a tough looking new enemy, the Monk Supporter.\n## Mirrormere\nWhen at last you reach your destination and return to monkey form, you'll find yourself at the foot of the Mirrormere Shrine. The Keeper of the New West will bid you to plunder the small temple on the frozen lake to find the next Sense of the Great Sage.\nBefore you do that however, there's a couple things to check out before crossing the giant frozen lake.\n\nFirst, start by exploring the area to the right when facing the lakeshore. You'll find assorted materials to harvest here, including **Fire Bellflowers** and a **Celestial Pear** tree in the far corner. Be on the lookout for a few scattered Frozen Corpses as you explore, and a Cyan Bat or two hiding up in the trees.\n\nThough the massive frozen lake expanse is largely empty, there is one thing worth stepping onto the ice for while on the right side. Head around a section of impassible rocks when stepping onto the ice, and run around past it to find a small alcove section with a small tree along another shore on the right.",
