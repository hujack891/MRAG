Here's everything you need to know to complete this questline, including a detailed walkthrough below.\n1. Defeat the Pale-Axe Stalwart\n2. Defeat the Brown-Iron Cart\n3. Defeat Gray-Bronze Cart\n4.

Speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart One More Time\n### Speak to Pale-Axe Stalwart Again\n\nYou can expect the same moveset from each of the carts, so again, the Fireproof Mantle Vessel works wonders here. For this one, though, you won't be able to get close to the feet and stay there without being hit with the fire attacks. So, stick close during the fist slam (without the fire) and dodge this.
