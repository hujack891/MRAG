Below you'll find a guide to accessing the mountain by defeating the Venom Daoist, and how to complete Hong Yi the Snake Guai's quest to defeat the Daoist Mi and Duskveil, as well as the formidable Scorpionlord.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* How to Access Purple Cloud Mountain\n* **Valley of Blooms**\n* **Bounds of Deity's Abode**\n* Yaoguai King - The Scorpionlord\n* **Petalfall Hamlet**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Daoist Mi\n* **Cloudnest Peak**\n* Yaoguai King - The Duskveil\nThis Chapter 4 Secret can only be accessed by finding and defeating the Venom Daoist in two different locations, and will transport you to a different location to fight a secret Yaoguai King and repair a Vessel that is instrumental in defeating the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - The Scorpionlord\nThough he's not the final boss of Purple Cloud Mountain, the Scorpionlord is as tough as they come, owing to the massive amount of damage he can perform with either his giant claw or venomous tail. You'll need a a lot of armor to withstand his hits, and plenty of poison defense to boot, which means using the Gall Soak, and poison-resistant curios to help you out.\nIf you recall your fights with the three Scorpion Princes in the Webbed Hollow, you may find more than a few of the Scorpionlord's attacks familiar, but don't be lulled into thinking you have him figured out: all of his moves strike faster, hit harder, and will evolve into longer combos as the fight drags on. Much of this fight will be learning his basic combos early, but being ready to adapt when he tricks you with extended attacks when you may otherwise think you have an opening.\n\nWhile your initial fight will start with him crouching down before launching a very long piercing tail strike, all subsequent attempts will begin with him whirling away from you, only to leap toward you fairly fast.\n\nJust like the Scorpion Prince, he'll slash at you with his claw while still airborne in front of you, but quickly follow up with a tailswipe to quickly spin about, letting him slam down with his claw for a third hit. As you can see, he'll be very tricky in alternating between his claw and tail, and you'll only have a second to see either appendage glow to know where his attack is coming from and react.\n\nOn the plus side, you can deflect his initial lunge with a Rock Solid Deflection, but be wary when using Immobilize, as he's prone to escaping faster than other bosses, so you'll need to follow with a strong hit or risk him breaking out to resume his combo attacks.",
