Much as Chapter 2's frog boss was imbued with lightning attacks, so too does this boss have the power of ice on his side, and unless you take precautions, you'll be frozen solid and out of stamina -- unable to move while you're torn to pieces.\nHaving body warming medicine for this fight is a must, and it's highly recommended you equip the Frostspout Twig Curio, Fiery Gourd, and Circle of Fire Spell to offset his many frost-filled attacks.\n\nWhile he doesn't have a ton of health or as much defense as other bosses, he can still get even more dangerous when low on health. His standard arm attack combo can be supercharged, causing icy explosions in a line from each of his swipes, and causing his slam to build up a giant frost area below him while also boxing you in a ring of icy crystals.\n\nSurviving this can be very tough as he'll try to keep you trapped and locked in his icy lair until you can't move, and then follow up with a loud screech to explode the icy and rocks around him, or perform another follow-up attack.",
