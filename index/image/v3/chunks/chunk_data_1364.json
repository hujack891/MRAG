You'll need to stick to the main road through the Forest of Felicity to find a high ridge path, and take one of several exits on the left to enter the Towers of Karma area.\n### Old Ginseng Guai Miniboss Fight and Guide\nThis hulking brute isn't as deadly as the Non-Able boss fight, but he does has a few tricks up his sleeve. As you might expect, he can deal a lot of damage with poisonous roots much like the lesser Ginsengling, so having antimiasma medicine on hand is a good strategy.\nMany of the Old Ginseng Guai's attacks are slow and hard-hitting, and the guai himself moves at a fairly slow pace, making him the perfect target for hit and run attacks as needed.\n\nBy far his biggest and most threatening move comes when he plants his hand in the ground to grow an increase area of poison roots all around him. The range on this is fairly big, and he'll continue to grow it for some time, giving you a few options: stay well away and heal up, or climb onto your staff (with a full stamina bar) and wait it out.",
