Finding opportunities to get your own attacks in can be difficult, but you'll need to resist the urge to jump in too early or you'll be hit and staggered multiple times.\nGiven his long sweeping swings, having backup from A Pluck of Many or Spirits that summon other allies won't work as well as they'll tend to get hit even if he's focusing all his attention on you.\n\nThe one thing his powered up gauntlet isn't great at deflecting is Transformation attacks -- both from Spirits and Spells. The Ashen Slumber in particular is a good bet, as the Rat Captain has a very long evasive dash, and you can breath fire on him that can't be blocked, nor can your Fiery Burst detonation.\n\nTime your attacks well to find the gaps in his defenses, and remember to cultivate your Spirits and upgrade your Transformation Spell abilities as needed. When Non-Pure is finally defeated, you'll be able to absorb the last disciples spirit, the Non-Pure Spirit.\n\nNon-Pure",
