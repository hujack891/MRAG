Below you'll find a guide for the Valley of Ecstasy Region, including how to reach the valley itself by defeating Non-White, and exploring the different parts of the valley to uncover several Yaoguai Chiefs on the path to the New Thunderclap Temple, and completing the Treasure Hunter's Quest and the Pagoda Realm Prisoner's Quest by defeating the final Captain.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Mindfulness Cliff**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-White\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-White (Round Two)\n* **Forest of Felicity**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n* **Brook of Bliss**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Able\n* **Towers of Karma**\n* Yauoguai Chief - Old Ginseng Guai\n* **Longevity Road**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Captain Kalpa-Wave\nAfter you solved the monk's riddle by praying at four Buddha Statues in the Precept Corridor, you'll split up from Zhu Bajie and make your way into the belly button of a large Buddha statue along the cliffs, taking you up a narrow pathway and into the Mindfulness Cliff.\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\nLike the two Frog Guai before him, Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang is a formidable foe with surprising reach, and if you thought you'd seen everything a frog boss could do, you're sadly in for a surprise. Much as Chapter 2's frog boss was imbued with lightning attacks, so too does this boss have the power of ice on his side, and unless you take precautions, you'll be frozen solid and out of stamina -- unable to move while you're torn to pieces.\nHaving body warming medicine for this fight is a must, and it's highly recommended you equip the Frostspout Twig Curio, Fiery Gourd, and Circle of Fire Spell to offset his many frost-filled attacks.\n\nAs with his other big attack, your Pillar Stance can help keep you away from the blast, but you can also try creating a Ring of Fire to give yourself \"holy ground\" of sorts to stay safe in from the otherwise chilly prison.\n\nDefeat this third frog menace, and you'll gain another Tadpole and other materials to upgrade your Spirits and gear.\n\nLang-Li-Guhh-Lang",
