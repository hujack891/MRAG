You can prepare to mitigate his attacks by making sure you've crafted the Loongscale Armor Set, are stocked up on Shock-Quelling Powder, and apply the Soak to your Gourd that increases shock resistance.\nWhile he's nowhere as strong as the other dragons you've faced, you don't want to get to cocky, or you may find his electric attacks peeling off more of your health than you can restore, even with Zhu Bajie helping out.\n### The Zodiac Village of the Painted Realm\n\nOnce they've been defeated, you can approach the lone man. Zhu Bajie warns you to beware of him, but he seems harmless enough, and tells you he's in search of treasure, and promises to share it when he finds it -- though he'll likely get in trouble again before this is all through.\n\nHe'll mention part of the treasure's riddle - green without, and red within: a summer treat.
