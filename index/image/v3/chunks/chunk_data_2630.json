This is no easy task, as the scrappy little pig once journeyed with Wukong himself. This makes him a wily fighter, if a bit unorthodox.\nZhu Bajie prefers to attack with his special 9-pointed rake, and while it may look silly, it's absolutely dangerous. He can swing it in wide arcs in a few different ways, but he usually has a slow wind-up at first that you can dodge away from.\n\nWhen he starts spinning his rake in a low, wide arc, he can continue to spin until turning into a literal tornado. It can be hard to dodge at first, but once you do he'll have a hard time course-correcting, and you can follow his path until he spins himself dizzy.",
