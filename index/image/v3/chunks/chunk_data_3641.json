Hiding on the far side of Turtle Island this frozen boss can't be activated until you obtain a Key Item in the previous chapter. Cyan Loong is one of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n* Rewards: Tridacna Pendant, Thunderbone, Loong Pearl x1, Refined Iron Sand x2, Mind Core x1\n## Cyan Loong Boss Fight and Guide\nWhile the Cyan Loong is a bit smaller than Black Loong, he is much more ferocious, and can use his lightning powers to quickly deal double damage and tear you to pieces -- especially if you choose to face him after arriving on Turtle Island. You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive. You should also have the Loongwreathe or Kang-Jin Staff, and have a good set of spells equipped that compliment your attacks -- we reccomend Immobilize and Rock Solid, but you can also try using the Ring of Fire to buff yourself up in since the arena is small.\nThe Cyan Loong doesn't have a huge amount of attacks, but when they hit, they hit hard!\n\nSeveral of his moves have also been improved. His electric palm strike for instance now causes several lightning strikes in front of him, up from just a single blast, requiring you to dodge around to his sides instead of backward.\n\nIf he begins to hold his sword back while pointing at you, the air will crackle around him preventing you from getting close, and his two-handed sword swing will also unleash an electric projectile slash you'll need to evade.",
