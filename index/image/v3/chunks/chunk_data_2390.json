Lots of it. This can take on many forms, and you'll need to know how to deal with each of them.\n\nOne of the most basic attacks will be when it spews out a group of bloody projectiles from its body. They'll take to the air before arcing slowly over in your direction, but spinning your staff can let you clear them without issue.\n\nSometimes he'll throw several blood attacks into the mix one after the other to mess you up. Expect these bloody trails to come out in multiple directions (both above and from the sides) to try and confuse you, but remain focused on deflecting them as they arrive.",
