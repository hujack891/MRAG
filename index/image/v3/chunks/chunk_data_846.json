Below you'll find a guide for the Bitter Lake Region, including how to defeat Kang-Jin Star and the Cyan Loong on Turtle Island, and how to navigate the North Shore to unlock the Zodiac Village and defeat the Apramana Bat -- plus where to find the four Buddha Statues.\n*     * Yaoguai King - Kang-Jin Star\n* **Turtle Island**\n* Yaoguai King - Cyan Loong\n* **North Shore of the Bitter Lake**\n* Boss Fight - Chen Loong\n* Yaoguai Chief - Apramana Bat\n* **Precept Corridor**\nLeaving the Warding Temple where you learned the Ring of Fire Spell from the Ancient Master, you'll have to slide down a long slope to reach a mountaintop where a giant pair of cymbals have been wedged into a mountain peak.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Cyan Loong\nWhile the Cyan Loong is a bit smaller than Black Loong, he is much more ferocious, and can use his lightning powers to quickly deal double damage and tear you to pieces -- especially if you choose to face him after arriving on Turtle Island. You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive. You should also have the Loongwreathe or Kang-Jin Staff, and have a good set of spells equipped that compliment your attacks -- we reccomend Immobilize and Rock Solid, but you can also try using the Ring of Fire to buff yourself up in since the arena is small.\nThe Cyan Loong doesn't have a huge amount of attacks, but when they hit, they hit hard!\n\nWith his freshly empowered sword, Cyan Loong will deal more damage than ever before. A single sword swing can cleave your health apart, and if you already have the shock status effect, you can easily die in a single hit if you aren't careful. Be sure to counter this new phase with Evil Repelling Medicament to increase your defense, and have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand for any moment you do get the status effect.",
