The Violet Hail's moveset is as follows:\n* **Light Attack: Slash - Infest the enemy with the eggs on your blade.** As the Violet Hail, your attacks do damage through the eggs on your blade as the creature. This infests your enemies, dealing sustained damage with several attacks.\n* **Charged Heavy Attack: Self-Torment - Imbue the blade with eggs by self-wounding.** This is a rather unique attack, focused on stacking damage with several light attacks. Each time you imbue, you can stack sacks of eggs on the blade, which are then offloaded onto enemies with each attack, dealing damage to them.\n* **Spell: Hive Mind - Manually command infested larvae to explode, dealing severe damage.** This attack allows you to offload all the damage you have built up with your light attacks and charged heavy attacks.\n* **Spell: Self-Detonation - Upon self-detonation, deals area damage upon triggering de-transform.** This is a standard detonation upon manually exiting the Transformation. The damage infests enemies.\n## Black Myth: Wukong Violet Hail Transformation Location\nThe Violet Hail Transformation can be found in Purple Cloud Mountain within The Webbed Hollow. To reach this area, you will need to defeat the Venom Daoist twice - once in the Pool of Shattered Jade and then at the Court of Illumination at the Temple of Yellow Flowers in the chapter.
