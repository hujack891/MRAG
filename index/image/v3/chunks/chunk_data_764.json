He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).\nAs mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses.\n\nFinally, if he sheathes his sword entirely to concentrate on sending his electric talismans at you, prepare for a length barrage. As he performs a gesture with his hands low, he'll bring them up as he explodes with energy, and then send a salvo of electric talismans flying at you.\n\nIf caught off guard, it's very hard to escape them once you first get staggered, but if you see the attack coming, step back and refresh your stamina, and then start spinning your staff to deflect the barrage until he's done.",
