Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of Yellow Wind Ridge: Sandgate Village, as well as how to defeat its many bosses that include Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, the Earth Wolf, the King of Flowing Sands and his First and Second Rat Princes.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Village Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* Yaoguai Chief - Earth Wolf\n* Yaoguai Chief - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n* **Valley of Despair**\n* Yaoguai Chief - First Prince of Flowing Sands\n## Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\nThere’s one very important thing to get out of the way before discussing the rest of the fight. Despite the name, the Rat King of Flowing Sands is not your true target, and in reality you can complete this battle as soon as you defeat his son, the Second Rat Prince. However, if you choose to engage in regicide yourself, know that the prince will become enraged at the death of his father, and will gain a massive damage increase with empowered moves. But for all this risk, there is a reward — defeating the empowered Rat Prince will allow you to absorb his Spirit to use in attacks, which you **can’t gain otherwise**!\nWhen the battle begins, you’ll notice that the King wisely does not try to fight you up close. He’ll scurry behind his son and out of sight while the Second Rat Prince tries to hold your attention with massive swings from his spiked mace. The King can even burrow underground, creating a trail of flying dirt as he tries to evade you.\n\nThis usually ends with a quick wave of force as he pulls his weapon up that you’ll need to dodge, so don’t get too gutsy trying to retaliate early on this attack.",
