But, it has some powerful attacks even the Transformation is hard to control.\nThe Transformation allows you to transform into a rock guai, immune to all Four Banes. Azure Dust also builds up Might when hit. Azure Dust's moveset is as follows:\n* **Light Attack: Earth Shatter - Strike the enemy three times with your heavy head**. This is a powerful slam on the ground with your head that can be repeated.\n\n* **De-transformation Attack: Body Slam - Slam your body into the ground.** This is the final attack Azure Dust will perform when it runs out of stamina. It turns around and slams its whole body into the ground.",
