From the Shrine in the arena, head through the caves and take a left when it opens up. On your left you will find a cliff edge where you can use the Pungent Flesh Chunk.\n\nUsing it will cause the First Prince of Flowing Sands boss to spawn. In order to obtain the Loong Scales, you will need to have the boss destroy the wall in the arena with all the small statues. Destroying it will open up a small gap you can pass through to get the Loong Scales.\n\nThe best way to do this is to stand against the wall at a short-to-medium distance from the boss and have it do its slam with its hand.
