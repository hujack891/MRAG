Though the boss has two phases, you may not have as much trouble as you did with The Scorpionlord, since you won't have to deal with poison, and their attacks are a bit easier to read and counter.

Luckily, they are evenly spaced, and the timing isn't hard to get down.\n\nYou'll also find that more than a few of his regular combos from the first phase have been amplified and require further defensive actions. His arm sweeps for example can now extend into The Duskveil quickly pulling out his sword into two sweeping spin attacks, and blend into the other combo where he throws his sword into the ground.\n\nHis fluttering jump slam can now be extended as he flies back up to slam down a second time, then takes to the air again to pull his sword out to dive at you with a sweeping slice, and then a final aerial attack to stab his sword into the ground.\n\nWhile his projectile bones unleashed from his arm now come in two waves instead of one, he has a much more dangerous projectile attack that happens when he makes a very loud crowing noise.",
