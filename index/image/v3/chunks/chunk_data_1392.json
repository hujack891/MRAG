As such, you’ll want to equip yourself with the best possible gear in Chapter 2 — you may even want to complete the chapter and return back from Chapter 3 if you find yourself unable to make a dent in this boss. Make sure you’re stocked up on medicines to help bolster your damage output and damage reduction.\n\nHe may not have a sword, but the Mad Tiger’s fists work just fine, and can employ many combo attacks. His most common one starts with an uppercut punch, and then a downward strike after a short pause, and is then followed by a huge sweeping claw swipe that spins him around. If you want to try using Rock Solid, save it for the swipe so he doesn’t attack through his first two swings.\n\nAnnoyingly, he can also employ a similar strike with only the first two hits, but at a much more rapid pace.",
