    "img_above_text": "# The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm\n## Lower Pagoda (Level 2)\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Captain Lotus-Vision\nOne of four Captains of the Pagoda Realm, Captain Lotus-Vision is responsible for sealing many of the prison cells, and must be defeated before you can unlock them. He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\n\nFor each of these attacks, be ready with your Staff-Spin counter, and consider investing in skills to keep this move going and to attack out of it once you've deflected all the projectiles heading your way. A lot of this fight will come down to finding the right opportunities to strike after surviving his attacks, and you'll need all the boosts you can get.\n\nOther times, he may trigger a bunch of explosions on the floor, which only give you a moment's notice to dodge them, so stay mobile and roll around for a better chance of not getting hit.",
