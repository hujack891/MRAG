Unlike other enemies, he won't use any magic or ranged tricks on you, and trades it all in for overwhelming power and a mastery of martial arts that makes him an extremely challenging foe -- and that's before the restraints come off.\nIf you haven't made use of them in other fights, now is definitely the time to take advantage of all the medicinal pills and consumable buffs you can craft and use. Items like the Tiger Subduing Pellets to raise your attack and others that can raise your stamina or focus can all help out greatly, and you'll want every advantage on your side.\n\nWith many of his attacks having severely short range, the Thrust Stance can be incredibly useful to retreat into a heavy attack once you have a focus point. The Pillar Stance can also be useful to gain height over many of his low kicks, but you'll need to make sure you have a lot of spare stamina to soak up his hits.",
