Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n* Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n* Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Yellowbrow\nNo longer the small chubby monk you've seen previously, this much larger giant of a man is an incredibly dangerous and formidable foe, and uses a host of lightning attacks to try and inflict Shock status on you. Taking double damage from any of his attacks is highly inadvisable, so make sure your Shock-Quelling Powder is on your quickbar for this fight.\nYellowbrow chiefly attacks with a large spiked mace while he holds his magic seedbag in the other hand. Be incredibly wary of his weapon, as it has the ability to change its shape, and he can extend the handle at will both in size, length, and flexibility.\n\nFinally, in his angered state he can also unleash a much longer combo attack, often while yelling about how he's going to guide the world. If you can't get enough distance from him, be ready to try deflecting or Immobilizing him, or you'll have to dodge a series of three sweeping attacks as he slides his mace along the ground, then swings it over his head four times, followed by a large windup as he pulls it around from behind his back in one large sweeping strikes.\n\nThe better understanding you have of his attacks and their range, the more ready you'll be to deal with each of them in turn, evading his lightining strikes and quelling any shock status to minimize damage. Use the downtimes from his slower attacks to hit him hard with Spirit Attacks and expending your Focus Points to stagger him onto the ground.",
