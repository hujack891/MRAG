You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis.\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Son of Stones\nLand behind the Sone of Stones on the cliff and then attack to start the fight. He won't immediately jump up, so you can get a couple of free hits in.\n\nWhen the lighting attacks begin, get as far away from them as possible. He will start to lift his arms up and the lightning will get more intense, eventually ending in an explosion. As he does this, he will knock himself out and fall to the ground. The recovery from this attack takes a while, so dash at him and attack as much as you can. Here's a good opportunity to use Pluck of Many to maximize the time he's down for.",
