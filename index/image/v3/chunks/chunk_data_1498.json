You'll also be much stronger since the last time you met, so this fight may not even take a long.\n\nA longer deadly combo attack he can employ comes with three quick slashes ending in a jumping upward slash. After a brief pause in the air, he'll use his foot to send the blade slamming down vertically, and then yank it back up in an arc for a final two-hand diagonal slice attack. Your Rock Solid won't always stagger him mid-combo, so it's better to wait and parry the final slice so you can retaliate faster.",
