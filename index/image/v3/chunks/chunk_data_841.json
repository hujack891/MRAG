Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.\n\nFinally (and possibly most terrifyingly), she can hover high into the air and create a giant group of her electrified spears all around her, sending volleys of them outward in several directions to track you down.
