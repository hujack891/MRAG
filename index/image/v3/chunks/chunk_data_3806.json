It will roll back and forth over a small portion of the path each time, but if it hits you just once, it's game over.\n\nThe aim of this section is to find little alcoves or wider sections of the path, so you can dip into them and stay out of the ball's line of fire.\n\n**Here are some tips for completing this section:**\n\n* **Look for where the enemies are along the path.** Typically, this is where the path is wider or there's a place you can stop and wait.\n* **Watch where the ball is rolling to see where it starts and ends.** This changes as you make your way along the path, so it's always worth waiting for a second and seeing the length of the path the ball covers while it's rolling before you run.\n* **Use Cloudstep.** On the longer sections, where it seems like a mad dash to try and reach the next point, use Cloudstep to cover the ground quicker.\n* **Whenever you can, back enemies into the path of the ball.** They're not immune to the attacks, so it can make light work of them saving you the hassle.",
