    "img_above_text": "# Best Settings on PS5 and PC\nBlack Myth Wukong still has a bit of optimization to be done by the team at Game Science, but by pushing and pulling a few levers you can get the most out of this game as it stands today. There are some simple tweaks you can make to get the most out of the performance of this game on PC and PlayStation 5, and we’ve gone over each. This will net a 59% performance boost on PC and a bit smoother experience on PS5 so you’ll want to give these settings a shot.\nStarting on PC, there are a ton of options you can dive into to get the most out of the visuals and frames from Black Myth Wukong. If you have a mid-tier or lower GPU you can get the easiest performance boosts by simply turning **ray tracing off.** You will need to restart the game completely when turning ray tracing on or off for it to take effect.**If you still are having issues, look into turning down Shadow Quality, Visual Effects, and Hair** as your first stop as these will net you the highest performance boost when turned down. More on those in a moment.\nFor now let’s go through each setting and talk a bit about what kind of impact you’ll see from each. And before we go into settings, if you’d like to turn off Motion Blur, like I do it’s under the display settings. You’ll also find Camera Shake here if you’d like it turned down a bit.\n* Full Ray Tracing - On - Very High\nFirst things first we need to talk about Ray Tracing. Ray Tracing in this game is… kind of a mess right now. With Full Ray Tracing On, your only real option right now is Very High because Low and High, the other two options are currently broken. So if you are going to use Ray Tracing this is the way to go.\nHowever, with all that said, simply turning Ray Tracing off will give you a more stable performance and the game still looks quite good as you’ll still have the fantastic ssr that Game Science has implemented instead while maintaining performance.\n* View Distance High\nNot really a setting that makes a huge impact, but it will affect how vegetation looks in the distance. Going from high to cinematic doesn’t cause a loss of visuals, and your slight gain in framerate will result in your best possible outcome for this one.\n* Anti-Aliasing Quality - Very High / High\n* Post Effects High\nBloom and Lens flares are reduced below high, but the bigger problem I discovered was with any sort of smoke. For some reason, any setting lower than high can have a flicker in how it’s displayed, so avoid going lower than High for Post Effects.\n* Shadow Quality - Very High\nDepending on your graphics card, this will be the one setting you should consider turning down, but High is the sweet spot for it in terms of what you gain vs what you lose. At High you get a significant boost to overall performance. Below high you will continue to see performance gains, but you’ll begin sacrificing quality at this point which is why High is the sweet spot for most machines. According to Digital Foundry, you’ll see an 18% increase in performance vs the Cinematic setting for this option. That’s a massive improvement you should not ignore.\n* Texture Quality - Very High\nTexture quality, not only has very little impact on performance but also doesn’t seem to degrade as you go to the lower setting. For that reason, we recommend putting it on Very High as there seems to be almost no negative effects to doing so.\n* Visual Effects Quality - High (medium has an odd issue with fog)\nThis is one issue where we will recommend high, while Digital Foundry recommends medium. The reason for our recommendation is simply because there’s an odd flicker issue with fog and some other elements like rays that were often present at Medium, and bumping Visual Effects to High has a slight impact to your framerate, but not having the flicker makes it worth it. And you’re still seeing a 20% boost at High. If a flicker doesn’t bother you, Medium will see you net a 27% boost on performance.\n* Hair Quality - High\nWhile hair generally can look a little off in the game, at the high setting you’ll see the most from the visuals without impacting FPS as jumping just one level to Very High will see you drop 3 FPS with almost no discernable gains. Inversely, going lower seems to net you almost no benefit in terms of FPS and will make hair look much much worse. You do need a restart to see the effects of this setting.\n* Vegetation Quality - High\nVegetation doesn’t seem to have much impact at all to performance, but the High setting has the foliage looking the best with very little impact.\n* Global Illumination - Very High (or High)\nWhile you should also consider the High settings start by trying Very High in this category if you still have some overhead as visually, it’s almost the exact same as the Cinematic option. High, Medium, and Low will introduce some issues, but continue giving noticeable bumps in performance\n* Reflection Very High\nReflections should be set to very high, mainly because at all other levels you’ll see the introduction of an odd flicker on objects that are reflecting. This could be a part of the issue we mentioned for ray tracing, so Very High is the way to go here. Going lower than Very High also nets very little gain in performance, so go for the visual upgrade if you’re able.\nOverall our settings are just slightly different than those our friends at Digital Foundry recommended, but feel free to tinker and lock in what works best for you while we wait for patches from Game Science to lock it in.\n* PlayStation 5 - Balanced Mode\nAnd that leaves the **PlayStation 5.** Performance mode is the setting I’d normally recommend simply due to the fact that it has the most stable framerate, but because the game uses Frame Generation, I have to recommend **Balanced mode. Balanced mode** gives you a lower input latency, and because this game requires a faster response time that is the mode I'd recommend starting with.\nFor Fans: Shop Black Myth: Wukong Gaming Accessories",
