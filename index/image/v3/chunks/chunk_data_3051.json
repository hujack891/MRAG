This boss has a speciality - and it’s creating blood. Lots of it. This blood can be pretty dangerous too, as he’ll be able to create pools of it all around the arena, and even poison you with it, so make sure you’re stocked on a few antimiasma pills.\n\nThe most annoying part will be when he hunches over and starts to mumble. Lines of red will start appearing from the eyes on his back toward each of the blood pools he’s created, and will essentially suck the pools back in and regenerate a portion of health. Stop him the moment you see this with a well timed Immobilize, or try a Spirit with a mighty attack to stagger him out of it, otherwise the fight will just go on longer.",
