You’ll need to be well prepared to take him down, and make sure you have the best armor and weapons crafted. If you haven’t been using them much before, now is also an excellent time to invest in crafting consumable medicines. Items like the Evil Repelling Medicament to reduce incoming damage, and the Tiger Subduing Pellets to increase your own.\n\nThis leaping twisting fist slam attack can even come with little warning, as he’ll sometimes yell out while crouching before charging you and jumping into the move.\n\nHe may also abandon his martial arts stance to quickly dive to the side, and then pounce on you to follow up with two quick downward punches, and a heavy stomp afterwards. Don’t expect much room to fight back during this one unless you can Immobilize or get a charged strike ready to knock him off-balance.",
