Worse still -- there's a Cyan Bat hiding above the archer halfway across the plank who will divebomb you if you attempt to fight that archer, and likely send you toppling down to the level below to die from fall damage.\n\nIf you survive the fall, make sure to use the Incense Trail Talisman to quickly warp back to the Shrine instead of having to make the climb yet again.\n\nThere are a few strategies to try if you're having trouble here.
