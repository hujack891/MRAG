Visit our Spirit Locations page.\n## Best Spirits to Use in Black Myth: Wukong\nWhen you use a Spirit, you will temporarily transform into them and be able to perform their special move. Alongside these skills, each Spirit provides a boost to a general stat or status effect, such as an increase in Poison damage or an increase in Defense when performing a particular move like Rock Solid.\nUnlike Transformations, you will share the same health bar with Spirits, so it's crucial to pull them out at the right time. Not sure which Spirits to equip? Here are some we consider to be the best spirits to use in Black Myth: Wukong.\nWandering Wight| Guangmou| Tiger's Acolyte\n---|---|---\nBlade Monk| Non-White| Falcon Hermit\nClay Vajra| Flint Vanguard| Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang (Upgraded)\nRemember that Spirits can be upgraded! At any Keeper's Shrine, you can choose to Cultivate Spirits from the Self-Advance menu. This will allow you to upgrade your Spirits using a combination of Will and items like Blood of the Iron Bull and Tadpoles. If you like a Spirit, cultivate them so you can max out their buffs.\n### Guangmou\n\nThis Spirit is entirely missable if you get to the end of Chapter 1 without picking it up, but you'll also likely encounter it before you've got your Gourd. Thankfully, you can pick it up from the nearest Keeper's Shrine once you've got the Gourd, and we'd recommend you do so because it's a great one to have equipped especially in the early game.\n\nThe Wandering Wight provides a substantial buff to your defence, which can make all the difference in fights. Not only this, but its Faithful Kowtow special attack allows you to deal a chunk of damage by smashing the giant's head into an enemy.",
