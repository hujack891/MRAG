With multiple entrances and exits to this area, we’ll start with the first Shrine on the other side of the Crouching Tiger Temple.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Yellow Wind Sage\nThe final boss of Chapter 2 is a hulking rat who holds an incredible trident spear in one hand, while the other carries… a giant head? If you think this may limit his moves, you’re unfortunately in for a rude awakening. The Yellow Wind Sage has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, and is not only a deadly attacker, but a master of the Samadhi Winds — but more on that later.\nMake sure you're suitably prepared for the fight in the best ways possible: Craft a bunch of medicine to increase your damage absorption and max health, and allocate any Mind Cores you’ve found toward Celestial Medicine buffs. You should also have a full set of either the Galeguard or Insect armor fully crafted, as well as the Cloud-Patterened Stone Staff from defeating the optional Sihandang boss. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you’ve beaten the Chapter 2 Secret Boss and equipped the new Vessel, the Wind Tamer.\n\nThe most annoying move will lock you into an extended grab if you get hit, and has little warning. You’ll need to watch for him to stop and growl, going into a slight crouch before running toward you. He’ll then try and punt you with his right foot, and if connects, you’ll sail into the air only to be pinned down into the ground by his trident, where he’ll give you another stomp for good measure before tossing your body aside, dealing major damage through the whole process.",
