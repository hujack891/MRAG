As you might expect, he can deal a lot of damage with poisonous roots much like the lesser Ginsengling, so having antimiasma medicine on hand is a good strategy.\nMany of the Old Ginseng Guai's attacks are slow and hard-hitting, and the guai himself moves at a fairly slow pace, making him the perfect target for hit and run attacks as needed.\n\nFrom the boss area, you can find another path leading back up past a small wooden arch to the upper field of this region. There's a few wandering enemies to put down around here, including a Crow Diviner standing in a field looking over a Ginsengling hiding in the ground, and a green Wisp to absorb nearby.",
