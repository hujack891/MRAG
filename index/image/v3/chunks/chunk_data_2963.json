Such a powerful foe is deserving of your good consumables -- but you may want to practice a bit first before using them in battle.\n\nIf he flips his weapon before catching it, he'll quickly thrust it out in your direction, then jump toward you with a small side slash before doing a bigger sweeping spin with an electric wave of force around him, which you'll need to dodge around his side to keep pace with.",
