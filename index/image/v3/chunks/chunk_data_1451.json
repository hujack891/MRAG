    "img_above_text": "# The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm\n## Lower Pagoda (Level 2)\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Captain Lotus-Vision\nOne of four Captains of the Pagoda Realm, Captain Lotus-Vision is responsible for sealing many of the prison cells, and must be defeated before you can unlock them. He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\n\nIn addition to his usual attacks, he'll also start teleporting more aggressively, sending out a new laser beam as he appears at his new location up to three times -- ending with an extended laser beam for several seconds. Several smaller projectiles can also be expelled into the air as he teleports, which will slowly trail after you to deal minor damage if they catch up.\n\nHe can also start detonating a trail of explosions that follow you along the ground, but have a bigger indicator than the randomly placed explosions so you can outpace them by sprinting around and dodging.",
