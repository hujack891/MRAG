Below you'll find a guide for the final area of The Webbed Hollow, including how to track down the Violet Spider and defeat the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, as well as getting a rematch with the Venom Daoist to unlock a Secret Area, and finding the last Purple Talisman Altar.\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Mountain Trail**\n* **Forest of Ferocity**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Commander Beetle\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Fungiwoman\n* Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n* **Court of Illumination**\n* Boss Fight - Supreme Inspector\n* Yaoguai King - Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master\nAfter defeating the Violet Spider, you'll have to escape her spider swarm as she retreats, but luckily you'll be plucked to safety by the one Spider Sister that seems to be on your side.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master\nThe first time you approach this boss fight, you'll see the depths of the depraved power the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master possesses as he absorbs the Violet Spider into his being against her will. He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).\nAs mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses.\n\nYou'll need to learn this fight carefully, as things will only get harder in the final phase, and you'll need as much of your healing gourd as possible. The good news is that despite his tendency to burrow after you deflect him, many of his attacks - even his poison spewing and many of his point-blank electrical talisman attacks can all be deflected by Rock Solid to stagger him. If you follow up with a charged 4 Focus Point hit, he may even fall to the ground, giving you a huge window to take out his health -- but we recommend saving your Transformation for the last part.",
