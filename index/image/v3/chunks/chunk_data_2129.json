Much of this fight will be learning his basic combos early, but being ready to adapt when he tricks you with extended attacks when you may otherwise think you have an opening.\n\nHe can also run toward you and dive into the ground, forcing you to lose your lock on as he waits below ground for a moment before busting out to attack as he erupts forth. Don't get greedy after he appears, as he will usually follow his re-entry with a quick tail swipe that can turn into a grab if it connects, and immediately inject a large dose of poison into you while also dealing massive damage.",
