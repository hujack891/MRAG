Plan ahead by crafting or buying Body-Warming Pills to offset this.\n\nIf he begins to hold the blade in both hands, prepare for an extended attack with three alternating slices ending in an upward swing with a long delay. When he finally brings the blade down, he'll do so in a spinning multi-hit slash, followed by a final slam to emit a projectile slash.",
