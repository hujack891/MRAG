This is actually a great time to use any consumables you have on hand to buff yourself up, restore cooldowns or get back some Focus for the final phase.\n\nDespite this, the new phase won't actually begin until he grabs his sword again and charges at you, twisting his tail to slam down on you, and following up with two slow sword swings. Only then will a short cutscene play, and his true curse comes into play.\n\nAt this point, he'll no longer use his sword, focusing entirely on his electric fists and tail, and somehow dealing even more damage in the process.
