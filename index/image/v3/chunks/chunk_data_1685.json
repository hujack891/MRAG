Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of Yellow Wind Ridge: Sandgate Village, as well as how to defeat its many bosses that include Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, the Earth Wolf, the King of Flowing Sands and his First and Second Rat Princes.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Village Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* Yaoguai Chief - Earth Wolf\n* Yaoguai Chief - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n* **Valley of Despair**\n* Yaoguai Chief - First Prince of Flowing Sands\n## Village Entrance\nMake sure to take the time to view the new additions to the Chapter 2’s Shrines menu. Note that you can still freely fast travel back to any Shrine in Chapter 1’s Black Wind Mountain if you missed out on any secrets. The store is also selling very different items than it was in the previous chapter, and you’ll find that the selection will change based on which chapter you are in:\nYellow Wind Ridge Shrine Shop\nAntimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |\nMind Core (x2) - 720 Will | Silk (x2) - 600 Will | Yaoguai Core (x2) - 450 Will |\nLicorice (x5) - 120 Will | Aged Ginseng (x5) - 90 Will | Fragrant Jade Flower (x5) - 120 Will | Purple Lingzhi (x5) - 90 Will\nFire Bellflower (x5) - 120 Will | Jade Lotus (x5) - 90 Will | |\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Earth Wolf\nThis strange looking yaoguai has a lot of rushing attacks that are hard to get a sense of due to its attack patterns, and you’ll want to utilize your Immobilize spell for help interrupting these when possible.\n\nThough it can often rise up on its hind legs to slash at you with its front claws, certain times its wild swings will make it crash forward to land belly up. After a moment it will thrash around and try to damage you if close, but with an exposed unarmored part of its body, you can try freezing it in place and expending a charged attack - preferably with the Smash or Pillar Style to slam down on its ribs for extra damage.\n\nYou can also get an opportune strike after dodging its grab by using that moment to hit it hard with a Spirit attack from the Wandering Wight, and big enough hits can cause it to fall on its belly as well.",
