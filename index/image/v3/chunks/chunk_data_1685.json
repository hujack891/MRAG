If you weren’t able to trigger this, don't worry. You can crack the wall yourself, but it will require a major attack, much bigger than your little monkey frame can deal out. However, specific transformations will get the job done - like the Wandering Wight’s Spirit headbutt attack, or the Azure Dust transformation spell found elsewhere in this chapter.",
