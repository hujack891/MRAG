The Fox will tell you that a monk killed her, and now resides in the New Thunderclap Temple, but doesn't tell you exactly where.\n### Non-Void Miniboss Fight and Guide\nThe monk who killed the Fox Guai you encountered in the Forest of Felicity, Non-Void is one of the disciples of Yellowbrow, and has his own set of peculiar moves. While he doesn't deal elemental damage, he can be a hard target to pin down due to his ability to become non-corporeal, causing some of your attacks to pass right through him!\nThe key to defeating this foe is to learn his attacks, and more importantly learning which parts leave him vulnerable to counters, and when you won't able to hurt him. Whenever he becomes transparent, avoid using any moves like Immobilize as you'll just waste their cooldowns and mana.\n\nAnother attack he can perform while you engage him from the front will start when he bunches up his fists close to his body. He'll explode outward with a simultaneous punch and kick move, and then after a moment will follow up with two charging fist strikes while phased out, sending him forward several steps to pursue any backward evasions.\n\nOnce you learn to anticipate these attacks, you'll find it easier to outmaneuver him, and look for the best opening to expend your focus points and deal the most damage (doing so when he's Immobilized is also a good guarantee).",
