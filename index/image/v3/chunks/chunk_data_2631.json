This is no easy task, as the scrappy little pig once journeyed with Wukong himself. This makes him a wily fighter, if a bit unorthodox.\nZhu Bajie prefers to attack with his special 9-pointed rake, and while it may look silly, it's absolutely dangerous. He can swing it in wide arcs in a few different ways, but he usually has a slow wind-up at first that you can dodge away from.\n\nQuickly move in to make use of his stunned state, but you should probably try and attack from the sides, as he can sometimes react to the spinning by throwing up all over you... which isn't great.",
