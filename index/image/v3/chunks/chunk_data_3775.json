Located in the lowest section of The Webbed Hollow, he is one of the many frog minibosses you can encounter in the game, though he sports a hidden surprise.\n* Rewards: Buddha's Left Hand (Key Item), Tadpole, Refined Iron Sand, 1562 Experience, 1449 Will\n## Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw Boss Fight and Guide\nThe fourth Frog Guai boss in as many chapters, Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw is a poison-infused boss, much the way the previous frog enemies have used lightning or ice in their respective arenas. However, you'll soon find that poison isn't the only new thing that this particular boss brings to the table. Still, having Antimiasma Pills can be essential to your survival, due to the ability for you to resist repeat poisoning when consuming them.\n\nThis leaves two options: Retreat and continue the fight in a severely reduced space, or pop an Antimiasma Pill and brute force ahead while your immunity lasts. Given that the frog can also do a regular spew of poison in a wide arc that creates more hazardous spots on the ground, it's often better to just rely on the pills rather than restricting your movement even more.\n\nIf you thought that was the extent of his moves, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. Perhaps you've been wondering ever since defeating Buddha's Right Hand where the other hand went? Turns out, it's inside Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw!",
