As these are perfect dodges, you'll see multiple illusions left behind in its wake, which will explode after a few seconds. To counter this, you'll want to land a few hits, and then jump back to avoid the explosions, but continue to follow up and complete the combos for a heavy attack.\n\nWe'd recommend having Ring of Fire equipped, so you can match him, and upgrade it as much as possible. Strangely enough, if you step into his Ring of Fire, you can also use it to build your Focus.\n\nHowever, you may prefer to use Spell Binder (if you've unlocked it) and increase your Attack and Critical Hit Chance. We'd also suggest using Plantain Fan again in this phase. You should also use Medicines like the Loong Aura Amplification Pellets, Ginseng Pellets, and Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets to buff your Focus gain and attack.",
