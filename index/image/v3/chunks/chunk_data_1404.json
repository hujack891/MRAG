As such, you’ll want to equip yourself with the best possible gear in Chapter 2 — you may even want to complete the chapter and return back from Chapter 3 if you find yourself unable to make a dent in this boss. Make sure you’re stocked up on medicines to help bolster your damage output and damage reduction.\n\nExpect this fight to take a lot of practice, and considerable upgrades in skills on your part to deal enough damage to survive the fight. While most Rock Solid deflections won’t be enough to stop him, retaliating with charged heavy strikes or crashing an Immobilize can sometimes stagger him several times and give you several openings. Using the Azure Dust Transformation is also useful to soak up his most damaging combos and retaliate with heavy charged hits to take chunks off his health.\n\nKeep practicing against dodging his moves, finding the right times to deflect the end of his combos (or just use Cloud Step to get out of the way) and always watch carefully when you stagger him to avoid his rising grab. Having the concoction to increase your max health can be beneficial if you’re unable to evade his grab or lengthy combos.",
