This is no easy task, as the scrappy little pig once journeyed with Wukong himself. This makes him a wily fighter, if a bit unorthodox.\nZhu Bajie prefers to attack with his special 9-pointed rake, and while it may look silly, it's absolutely dangerous. He can swing it in wide arcs in a few different ways, but he usually has a slow wind-up at first that you can dodge away from.\n\nOnce you've dealt enough damage to clear his health bar, Zhu Bajie will flee the Hut of Immortality. The battle isn't exactly over, but you will get some experience and will for surviving the encounter.",
