Below you'll find a guide for the Bitter Lake Region, including how to defeat Kang-Jin Star and the Cyan Loong on Turtle Island, and how to navigate the North Shore to unlock the Zodiac Village and defeat the Apramana Bat -- plus where to find the four Buddha Statues.\n*     * Yaoguai King - Kang-Jin Star\n* **Turtle Island**\n* Yaoguai King - Cyan Loong\n* **North Shore of the Bitter Lake**\n* Boss Fight - Chen Loong\n* Yaoguai Chief - Apramana Bat\n* **Precept Corridor**\nLeaving the Warding Temple where you learned the Ring of Fire Spell from the Ancient Master, you'll have to slide down a long slope to reach a mountaintop where a giant pair of cymbals have been wedged into a mountain peak.\n## Boss Fight - Chen Loong\nLike the other Loongs in The New West, Chen favors using lightning magic, and is a much more caster-oriented opponent compared to the others. You can prepare to mitigate his attacks by making sure you've crafted the Loongscale Armor Set, are stocked up on Shock-Quelling Powder, and apply the Soak to your Gourd that increases shock resistance.\nWhile he's nowhere as strong as the other dragons you've faced, you don't want to get to cocky, or you may find his electric attacks peeling off more of your health than you can restore, even with Zhu Bajie helping out.\n### The Zodiac Village of the Painted Realm\nConsider the Zodiac Village in the Painted Realm your new hub area, a home away from home. Chen Loong has invited his fellow Zodiac Deities to stay here, which include the Xu Dog and Shen Monkey who you've already met. This means you now have a quick hub area to warp to as needed to trade in your Mind Cores, and upgrade your Gourds.\nIn addition to this, Chen Loong himself will accept any seeds you may have randomly looted when harvesting plants, which will create more materials to freely harvest over time.",
