While you may recognize a good number of his moves, you'll soon find that he's also been infused with a lot of frost power, and can quickly chill and render you immobile before dealing a killing blow. As such, having chill-resistant items and curios will be of great help here.\n\nIt'll take a lot of repositioning to survive this fight, and you'll also need to be aware of one other new attack that seems harmless but can deal a good amount of damage, as the Monk from the Sea can either leap toward or away from you with a deceptive blast.",
