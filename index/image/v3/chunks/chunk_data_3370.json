Though the boss has two phases, you may not have as much trouble as you did with The Scorpionlord, since you won't have to deal with poison, and their attacks are a bit easier to read and counter. Strangely enough, it also starts the fight at around 75% of its health, but it does have a second health bar waiting, so pacing yourself can be the key to this fight.\n\nHe'll leap backward after this, sprouting a lot more bony projectiles to throw at you in a concentrated burst. Like before, they can be dodged or even deflected with your staff spin (but they will eat up a lot of stamina).",
