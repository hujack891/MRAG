Plus, when it comes to using the Buddha's Eyeballs, it can be tricky to find out what to do.\nThis guide covers all Buddha's Eyeball locations in Black Myth: Wukong, where to use them to unlock a secret boss, and more.\n## All 6 Black Myth: Wukong Buddha's Eyeball Locations\nThere are six Buddha's Eyeballs in Black Myth: Wukong, which are found in the following locations in Yellow Wind Ridge:\n* Fright Cliff - Squall Hideout (just before the Shrine)\n* Along the rafters on the right side of the Fright Cliff - Squall Hideout area, by some Blazebones enemies\n* Along the left path in Fright Cliff - Squall Hideout. Head up the hill and turn left once you reach the statue\n* Along the main, central path heading the Squall Hideout towards the Rockrest Flat shrine\n* Found within the cave on the right in Fright Cliff - Squall Hideout, just before the Rockrest Flat Shrine. Near the Mother of Stones boss, take a right to a cliff edge with the statue head\n* Directly on the left, once you reach the Rockrest Flat Shrine\n### Black Myth: Wukong Buddha's Eyeball 5 Location\nA little further on, on the left side of the area, you will see a covered area of the cave with some more Blazebones.
