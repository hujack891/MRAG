Oddly enough, despite his appearance, he doesn’t employ any poison attacks, so having the Celestial Lotus Seeds as your gourd’s Soak is the better option for this fight.\nThe Whiteclad Noble opts instead to attack with his strong spear, and can harness the power of water itself to amplify its reach. He’ll use it often to create waves of watery force you’ll need to dodge or suffer a lot of damage from. He’s also not above simply tossing his spear at you, and then calling it back to his hand.\n\nMany times he employs either the first half or the entire combo attack, he’ll wait a moment before readying his next move. Watch for him to pull his spear back as he twists his body, as after a brief delay he will swing his spear around in a circle spin that’s tough to dodge, as it creates a delayed watery shockwave circle further out. Because of this, you’ll want to dodge toward him, and not retreat into the shockwave.",
