This Yaoguai Chief hides in the Valley of Ecstasy, serving a penance alone above a nearby brook.\n* **Rewards:** Non-Able Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Cold Iron Leaves, Random Materials, 1847 Experience, 1182 Will\n## Where to Find Non-Able\nNon-Able is an optional boss, and sits alone in a large snowy field in the Valley of Ecstasy. You'll find him by heading down the hill from the main road in the Forest of Felicity and into the Brook of Bliss, and then cross the bridge and head up the hill past the Shrine.\n### Non-Able Miniboss Fight and Guide\nDon't mistake his subdued appearance for weakness, Non-Able is probably one of the toughest Yaoguai Chief bosses you'll face in Chapter 3. Unlike other enemies, he won't use any magic or ranged tricks on you, and trades it all in for overwhelming power and a mastery of martial arts that makes him an extremely challenging foe -- and that's before the restraints come off.\nIf you haven't made use of them in other fights, now is definitely the time to take advantage of all the medicinal pills and consumable buffs you can craft and use. Items like the Tiger Subduing Pellets to raise your attack and others that can raise your stamina or focus can all help out greatly, and you'll want every advantage on your side.\n\nNon-Able will always start his second phase with an immediate charge to grab you. This can't be blocked, and the timing can be hard to dodge to the side, so you're better off dodging backward or using Cloud Step when he reaches out with his right hand. Get caught, and you'll take a ton of damage. Be warned if you try to Immobilize him mid-grab, he can often pop out of it and continue the grab animation unless you reposition yourself somewhere safe.",
