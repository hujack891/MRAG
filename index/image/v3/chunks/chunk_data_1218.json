Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n* Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n* Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n## Temple Inner Courtyard\n### Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-Pure\nNon-Pure is a very aggressive fighter, similar to Non-Able, but instead uses a large sweeping monk spade to attack in long combo swings that can be difficult to escape from. Finding opportunities to get your own attacks in can be difficult, but you'll need to resist the urge to jump in too early or you'll be hit and staggered multiple times.\nGiven his long sweeping swings, having backup from A Pluck of Many or Spirits that summon other allies won't work as well as they'll tend to get hit even if he's focusing all his attention on you.\n\nTo make matters worse, Non-Pure also has a large gauntlet that he can periodically imbue with deflecting power, making him even harder to damage when he's not unleashing combos. Look for the glow in his glove (and especially his arm tattoo glowing bright as he's likely to hide his glove behind his back) to know when he's most likely to knock your attacks aside, and resist the urge to expend your focus points.",
