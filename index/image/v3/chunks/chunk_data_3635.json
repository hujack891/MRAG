Hiding on the far side of Turtle Island this frozen boss can't be activated until you obtain a Key Item in the previous chapter. Cyan Loong is one of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n* Rewards: Tridacna Pendant, Thunderbone, Loong Pearl x1, Refined Iron Sand x2, Mind Core x1\n## Cyan Loong Boss Fight and Guide\nWhile the Cyan Loong is a bit smaller than Black Loong, he is much more ferocious, and can use his lightning powers to quickly deal double damage and tear you to pieces -- especially if you choose to face him after arriving on Turtle Island. You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive. You should also have the Loongwreathe or Kang-Jin Staff, and have a good set of spells equipped that compliment your attacks -- we reccomend Immobilize and Rock Solid, but you can also try using the Ring of Fire to buff yourself up in since the arena is small.\nThe Cyan Loong doesn't have a huge amount of attacks, but when they hit, they hit hard!\n\nAnother dangerous attack he can launch with little warning only comes with a small tell -- when he quickly swaps his sword to hold in a reverse grip behind his back. He'll then quickly launch himself through the air at you with a spinning slash that can take a chunk off your health, and then dive back to your position after a moment for sword slice when he reaches the ground.",
