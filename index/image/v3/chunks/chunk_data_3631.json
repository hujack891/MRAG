Oddly enough, despite his appearance, he doesn’t employ any poison attacks, so having the Celestial Lotus Seeds as your gourd’s Soak is the better option for this fight.\nThe Whiteclad Noble opts instead to attack with his strong spear, and can harness the power of water itself to amplify its reach. He’ll use it often to create waves of watery force you’ll need to dodge or suffer a lot of damage from. He’s also not above simply tossing his spear at you, and then calling it back to his hand.\n\nDefeat him to earn a **Jade Fang** , and he’ll concede, revealing he was only feigning loyalty to the king of this mountain to learn more. He’ll also drop a helpful nugget of wisdom as he departs, mentioning though the temple lies in cinders, the Elder’s soul endures, and asks if you’ve seen the three bells.\n\nWhiteclad Noble\n\nThis will finally prompt the Keeper to tell the tale of the three bells — two of which you’ve found guarded by Guangmou and Guangzhi. The third happens to lie not far from this site. Instead of moving forward, look to the left to spot a flooded ravine to travel through.",
