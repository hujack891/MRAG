Whenever you see them, focus on attacking one and luring it closer to other enemies, to take advantage of their explosive abilities. When they're in groups, and each one has a low health bar, this can sometimes cause a chain of explosions as they knock each other out one by one.\n\nAs you step through the next bit, be careful of the Lavabat.
