You can prepare to mitigate his attacks by making sure you've crafted the Loongscale Armor Set, are stocked up on Shock-Quelling Powder, and apply the Soak to your Gourd that increases shock resistance.\nWhile he's nowhere as strong as the other dragons you've faced, you don't want to get to cocky, or you may find his electric attacks peeling off more of your health than you can restore, even with Zhu Bajie helping out.\n### The Zodiac Village of the Painted Realm\n\nBefore heading back to the North Shore Shrine, be sure to check the large pool of water to the left of the treasure hunter. There's a **Treasure Chest** at the foot of the pool that holds various materials, and at the far end, you can find a small rock with a Gourd Drink placed upon it: **Bluebridge Romance**!",
