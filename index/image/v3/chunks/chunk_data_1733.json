From the **Front Hills Keeper's Shrine in the Forest of Wolves,** you'll work your way toward your first boss fight with the Bullguard. Opposite the mini-boss, you can find a stream of water. As you approach it, you'll see a monkey near the statue in the water, who will run off. Go to the statue after the monkey has disappeared and pick up the Skandha of Form from it.",
