Below you'll find a guide for the Valley of Ecstasy Region, including how to reach the valley itself by defeating Non-White, and exploring the different parts of the valley to uncover several Yaoguai Chiefs on the path to the New Thunderclap Temple, and completing the Treasure Hunter's Quest and the Pagoda Realm Prisoner's Quest by defeating the final Captain.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Mindfulness Cliff**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-White\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-White (Round Two)\n* **Forest of Felicity**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n* **Brook of Bliss**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Able\n* **Towers of Karma**\n* Yauoguai Chief - Old Ginseng Guai\n* **Longevity Road**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Captain Kalpa-Wave\nAfter you solved the monk's riddle by praying at four Buddha Statues in the Precept Corridor, you'll split up from Zhu Bajie and make your way into the belly button of a large Buddha statue along the cliffs, taking you up a narrow pathway and into the Mindfulness Cliff.\n## Forest of Felicity\n### The Snow Fox's Quest\nNot far from the Forest Shrine, look for a small arch along the main path, and you'll find a unique corpse sitting along the wood posts that looks different from the rest. You can interact to hear a voice -- coming not from the body, but from the fox pelt around its neck. Apparently that story about the snow fox and the human you saw after completing Chapter 2 actually happened, and the fox guai wants revenge.\nShe'll gift you the Snow Fox Brush, allowing you to take the form of the Snow Fox and seek out the human scholar who resides in New Thunderclap Temple.\nHowever, it's a long road to get there, and you can't attack in this form, so for now it's better that you De-transform, and use the key item later on when you're close to your target.",
