He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).\nAs mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses.\n\nAs the fight rages on, expect him to employ a wider variety of both sword and electric attacks with his talismans, employing new combos to slice or slam, and then shoot out electric blasts or imbue his sword for bigger hits. One move to be wary of seems easy enough at first, as he'll charge up his sword by holding it close to his left side, and then unleash an upward lighting slash to his right. However, he'll immediately grab at you with his free hand, and squeeze the life out of you if you are too close to him following that first slash.",
