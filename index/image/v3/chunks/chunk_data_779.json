Focus built up before transformation can be converted for use afterwards within the rat guai's form.\nAshen Slumber's moveset is as follows:\n* **Light Attack: Chop Wood - Swing the iron blade to build up Focus.** This is a standard four-hit combo.\n\n* **Heavy Attack: Blow Fire - Hold heavy attack to unleash, consuming Focus to continuously burn enemies ahead.** This is a great crowd-control move, damaging enemies with a continuous stream of fire for several seconds ahead of it.",
