    "img_above_text": "# Temple of Yellow Flowers Walkthrough\nThe Temple of Yellow Flowers is the final main area of Black Myth: Wukong's Chapter 4, located high above the Webbed Hollow on. Below you'll find a guide for the final area of The Webbed Hollow, including how to track down the Violet Spider and defeat the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, as well as getting a rematch with the Venom Daoist to unlock a Secret Area, and finding the last Purple Talisman Altar.\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Mountain Trail**\n* **Forest of Ferocity**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Commander Beetle\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Fungiwoman\n* Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n* **Court of Illumination**\n* Boss Fight - Supreme Inspector\n* Yaoguai King - Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master\nAfter defeating the Violet Spider, you'll have to escape her spider swarm as she retreats, but luckily you'll be plucked to safety by the one Spider Sister that seems to be on your side.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master\nThe first time you approach this boss fight, you'll see the depths of the depraved power the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master possesses as he absorbs the Violet Spider into his being against her will. He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).\nAs mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses.\n\nThis is a good time to use your best Transformation Spell to help whittle down his health, especially if you're worried about the grab or are electrified and need to retreat. The Golden Lining transformation is a good bet for its shock resistance, and many of his massive attacks are slow enough that you can \"see through\" them to build up focus points and blast him back. If you haven't beaten Yellow Loong or aren't sure about his moves, you can also use Hoarfrost or Umbral Abyss to try freezing him, just be sure to keep on top of dodging his big blasts.\n\nThe last piece of his health bar is by far the scariest to take down, and you'll need to constantly be watching his electrified talismans to anticipate where his next big blast is coming from. If you have extra mana, you can also try going for the Pluck of Mana, or just focus on more Immobilizations and Rock Solid Deflections.\n\nOnce you've finally defeated the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, you'll be treated to the finale of the Spider Sisters and their mother. Note that you'll now gain all the Yaoguai Chief entries for the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Sister (despite you not having actually fought against them).\n\nHundred-Eyed Daoist Master",
