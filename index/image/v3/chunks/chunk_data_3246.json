Understanding the differences and similarities in their style can help you succeed in this fight, but it will take a little practice.\n\nAs for his more unique attacks, watch for the Tiger Vanguard to raise his hands up, as he’ll then let loose an incredibly powerful roar that will damage you, and cause rock explosions all around him. This one can be very tough to dodge considering the range and how quickly he goes into the roar, but you can stop him short by Immobilizing him and then dealing enough damage to stagger him and prevent the roar altogether.\n\nSince he’s not as powerful or varied as the Vanguard of the Crouching Tiger Temple, nor is he as unrelentingly powerful as the Mad Tiger below the well, he shouldn’t give you as much problems as his sons. Remember to try switching up your stances — especially to the Thrust Stance — if you want to play it safe with longer range heavy strikes out of his reach.",
