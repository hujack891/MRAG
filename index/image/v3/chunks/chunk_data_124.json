Though this is another boss with a limited moveset, it can be easy to die to the Poison Chiefs if you're not careful.\n\nJust like stone bosses and the flint bosses from Chapter 5, most of the attacks from the Poison Chief will be charges and slams. It will try to use the weight of its body to attack while delivering smatterings of poison around the area.\n\nIts charges can be avoided, by dashing out of the way just before it reaches you.
