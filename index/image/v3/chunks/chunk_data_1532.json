    "img_above_text": "# The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Macaque Chief (Second Encounter)\nThe good news is the Macaque Chief doesn't have many more surprises for you since the last fight -- even less since he won't bother trying to fake begging for mercy this time around. You'll also be much stronger since the last time you met, so this fight may not even take a long.\n\nIf it's been awhile since you fought him last, remember that his one major attack will have him jump into the air and slam his blade into the ground, and then perform series of quick claw swipes in front of him with surprising reach, all while keeping close to the blade behind him -- meaning he can't really pivot if you dodge and attack from the sides.\n\nHe'll step back to grab the sword with his foot and jump onto its hilt, before preforming a quick roll along the ground to drag the sword in a whirlwind slice with a large reach to it, followed by a final downward slam, so don't press your attack too hard during this combo, or Immobilize him before the second part of his combo.",
