You'll need to complete all chapters' secret areas and an elusive side quest to access the area, then take on the incredibly strong Erlang, The Sacred Divinity. Completing this Kaiju fight will allow you to unlock the game's secret ending.\n\n\nAfter crash landing back on Mount Mei, two giants will emerge. This is the Destined One's Stone Monkey form and Erlang Shen. When Erlang is thrown off into the distance, you'll be thrown into a fight against the Four Heavenly Kings.\n\n\nAbout halfway through the fight, you'll also be able to start using Ice Bath. When you use the Ice Bath Spell, the Stone Monkey's arms will be covered in frost, and when you punch, you'll inflict frost damage.\n\nWhen the Four Heavenly Kings have been taken down, there's just one more giant to deal with, which is Erlang Shen.\n\n## Erlang Shen Boss Fight and Guide\"\n            - Following Text: \"You should similarly approach the fight to the Four Heavenly Kings, and use Primal Punch to build up your Focus. When it's built up, use Earthshatter Slam to replenish your health and perform a heavy attack, and keep Rock Solid for moments when you can deflect Erlang Shen's blade attack.\n\nWhen Erlang Shen's health reaches around 70%, he'll imbue his sword with fire, and start to use it as a whip. This will make the fight a bit tougher, but you'll replenish your health whenever you use Eartshatter Slam. Be sure to use Ice Bath to counter these fire attacks.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.
