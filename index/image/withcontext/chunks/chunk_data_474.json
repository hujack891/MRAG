You can find it at the Rhino Watch Slope, which the Feng-Tail General will conveniently take you to.\n\n## How to Find Gold Armored Rhino\n\nOnce you've completed the stamina and health test from the Feng-Tail General, drop down from it and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire.\n\n### Gold Armored Rhino Boss Fight and Guide\n\nWhen you can't use the Wandering Wight, you need to build focus quickly. Alternatively, just keep holding charge until you’ve built your focus up. If you’re building your focus up naturally, then it’s worth using Immobilize when it's ready again to get the Rhino to stand still so you'll have more chance of hitting your target. You don't want to waste your attacks in this, otherwise, you could be in for a lengthy fit.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Though you can do damage by hitting the Rhino in other areas, there’s little point in doing so unless you want the fight to last a long time. If you miss hitting the horn, you can still attack it. Avoid hitting its face and instead focus on hitting it from behind. This will annoy it, and it will buck to try and kick you with its back legs.\n\nBut if you’re holding charge to build it up, wait until the Rhino is coming toward you or pauses for a moment, and then unleash the attack. One of the best times to hit is when it's moving slowly, with sparks appearing around its horn.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
