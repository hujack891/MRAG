He's the final boss of the Chapter, so expect a challenging fight.\n\n\nThis fight will begin immediately after finishing the fight against Red Boy.\n\n## Yaksha King Boss Fight and Guide\n\nZhu Bajie will be helping you out at the start of this fight, so you can use him as a distraction while you get some hits in. It's also wise to try and hold off on healing as much as you can and allow Zhu Bajie to do this for you instead.\n\nWhen the Yaksha King begins to throw out those circular projectiles, you'll find that these often are around 4-5 at a time. It's best to dodge them by rolling forward, toward the Yaksha King, so you can immediately attack as the last one is dashed.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The move that feels like his signature for the fight is one where small blades emerge from the floor (almost grass-like). They are incredibly visible, but they'll only stick out slightly from the ground when he starts to perform the attack. When you see them, you'll have a few seconds to get away from the ring of blades, because they'll shoot up as full-blown spikes in no time.\n\nWhile it's easy to avoid this move at first, he has another variation that will cover a larger amount of the arena. This will begin with one circle of blades appearing, and then a second one forming as an extension. In this case, you can jump or dodge to avoid the attacks, but the timing of this can be difficult, so running from the area is the most straightforward way to not get caught in this.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
