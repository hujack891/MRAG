You'll need to summon her with Fire Ore to make her appear, then you're in for a fight against her and her Flamlings.\n\n## How to Find Mother of Flamlings\n\nThis is actually where you can summon a miniboss called the Mother of Flamlings, and to do so, all you need to give over is 4x Flame Ores. Thankfully, Flame Ores are dropped by Flamlings, so you'll hopefully have enough by this point to summon her immediately. Approach the glowing patch and deliver the Flame Ores.\n\n### Mother of Flamlings Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThese will land on the ground and turn into glowing patches. Unfortunately, these will become Flamlings, so be mindful of these as you run around the arena.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The Mother of Flamlings, thankfully, won't move. She'll stay where she is and use ranged fireball attacks, very similar to the Flamlings. To combat this, get as close to her as possible and try to land a few attacks. The downside of this, however, is that she will try to whip you with her body. If you can dodge these, she'll smack herself into the ground and be temporarily stunned.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
