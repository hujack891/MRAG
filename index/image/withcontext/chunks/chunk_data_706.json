If you want to be able to access this, there are actions you'll need to take early on in the level, which involve defeating the Venom Doaist mini-boss. Want to know the right path to follow in the Webbed Hollow to get started? Here's how to do it.\n\n* How to Find the Venom Daoist\n* How to Find the Venom Daoist for the Second Time\n\n## How to Find the Venom Daoist\n\nFrom here, go right and continue following the path lined with spider sacs. As you reach the other side, you'll see a large white sac in the middle.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Go near it and a health bar will appear for the Old Cocoon. Hit it to destroy it, and eventually reveal the Venom Daoist. When you beat him, he'll run off and allude to settling the score with you once he's reached his full mastery.\n\n### Warning: Missable Gear!\n\nAt the end of this fight, you can potentially receive the Venomous Armguard, but you'll need to approach the fight in a specific way to achieve this. The Venom Daoist has 6 arms on his back, and you'll need to break the bottom 4 for him to drop the armguards. If you kill him before doing this, he won't drop anything. Use the lowest damage weapon that you have, and focus your attacks on his back. If you're having trouble with it, use Immobolize to keep him still.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
