There's a nearby open cell door you can find that has a **Treasure Chest** containing a few materials, guarded by a Withered Corpse.\n\nBeyond this lone cell, you can find the outside walkway path abruptly ends near a Frozen Corpse, and a darkened pit holds a series of rocky platforms you can drop down. The only thing down here at the moment is a cell with a purple seal, and a route back to where you first arrived in the Pagoda Realm, so unless you really want the green Wisp hovering over the drop back down to the start, it's better to leave this area for later.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Back at the top of the stairs to the second level, head along the outside path to the right this time. The first open cell as you head this direction will have a green Wisp to absorb to replenish some of your gourd's healing charges.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
