Hidden beyond a waterfall of sand in the Fright Cliff, you won't be able to encounter this boss until you obtain a Key Item elswhere in this chapter, Black Loong is one of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n\n* **Rewards:** Tridacna Pendant, Thunderbone, Loong Pearl x1, Refined Iron Sand x2, Mind Core x1\n\n\nWith the Loong Scales, you'll be able to interact with the sandfall and remove it as a barrier, revealing a door behind it to take you into the Black Loong's lair.\n\n## Black Loong Boss Fight and Guide\n\nAny time you see the Black Loong’s weapons flare to life and crackle, you can expect them to detonate with massive electrical explosions whenever they slam into the ground. In particular, he can use a large leaping slam to cause a sizable explosion you’ll need to avoid with a well-timed dodge. He’ll often end this slam by dragging his weapons around to his sides, so try to evade backwards or get around to his back before retaliating.\n\nHe also has a variety of melee swings - sometimes swinging both weapons in slow arcs to slam in the ground one after the other before a third and final electrical slam. Other times he’ll alternate slamming the ground with each weapon while it’s imbued on either side of his body.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The Black Loong has a particularly devastating but slow combo where he’ll begin to swing a weapon in the air above his head and then swing it down in a sweeping electrical arc in front of him, before doing the same as his other weapon. Thankfully the movements are very slow and easy to dodge if you aren’t using up all your stamina when attacking. They do however send out currents in front of him, so don’t think that just backpedaling will be enough to stop you from getting hurt.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.
