With a loud gong, the trapped \"Admiral\" will use the cymbal to awaken a giant turtle whose mountainous shell you're actually standing on.\n\nAs the turtle begins to swim through the Bitter Seal, the woman will become aware of your presence, starting this new region off with a bang of a boss fight.\n\n\nAs long as your patient to wait for the right moments to get in close and attack, and make sure you're using shock-quelling medicine, you'll be able to come out on top. Even as Kang-Jin Star tries to flee in her dragon form, the Destined One will see to it that she crashes into the large cymbals, freeing the prisoner inside!\n\nThis imprisoned Pig Guai is none other than Zhu Bajie, who traveled with Sun Wukong during his adventures in Journey to the West!\n\n\nAs you start exploring the path over to the right, an echoing voice will lead you to a large open platform where dragon humanoid figure appears to be frozen in place with its fishing rod. If you interact with it while holding the Loong Scales, it will crackle to life, and begin a new secret boss fight.\n\n\nWhen he falls, you'll earn some Fine Gold Thread and another Loong Pearl, and can loot a nearby chest that appears for the Mountain-Shaking Claw material and Breath of Fire Soak for your Gourd. This new material will unlock the upgrade path for your Loongwreathe Staff into the Golden Loong Staff, but you'll need to find and defeat the last of the four Loongs to craft it.\n\nOnce you've had your fill of exploring the \"Turtle Island\", you can head to the front where the small Pig Guai stands waiting, and interact with him for the turtle to finally make its landing at the next part of the Bitter Lake.\n\n\nStart by heading along the shore and defeating various Frozen Corpses, and look for a small building in the distance by the water's edge. As you near it, you can also spot a dragon man standing alone in the shallows. Zhu Bajie seems to know him, but as you approach, you'll be pulled into another boss fight.\n\n\nAs you head close to inspect the skull of the great snake, a Yaoguai Chief will fly down to intercept you: a much bigger version of the bats you've faced recently!\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Apramana Bat\n\nAs you head up the stone stairs, look for a small pathway on the left where Zhu Bajie will point out a small enclosure. Be ready to deal with both a Falcon Fan-Maker and Cyan Bat. Shut down the Falcon with Immobilize so you can quickly remove the bat, and then focus your attention on defeating the stronger falcon enemy.\n\nWith both of them down, you'll find that they were guarding a **Luojia Fragrant Vine** , which you can now bring back to the Zodiac Village instead of going all the way back to Chapter 1!\"\n            - Following Text: \"At the top of the stone stair path, there's a small side path leading back to a spot with a Ginsengling overlooking the enclosure, and a tunnel. Take the tunnel, and you'll find a shortcut back toward the North Shore Shrine, but first you'll need to deal with a few Monk Supporters holding their heavy stones.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
