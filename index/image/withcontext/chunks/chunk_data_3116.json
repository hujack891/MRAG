Once it congeals, you'll find yourself facing the last of the four captains.\n\n### Captain Kalpa-Wave Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nAs the last of the four captains, Kalpa-Wave looks scarier than he actually is, especially once you learn his tricks.\n\nWith his large towering body, Kapla-Wave has a few physical attacks that generally alternate between stomps of his legs, or a mighty leap that causes him to crash into the ground, but both attacks aren't too bad to deal with.\n\nWhat really makes Kalpa-Wave unique is his ability to spew blood out. Lots of it. This can take on many forms, and you'll need to know how to deal with each of them.\"\n            - Following Text: \"One of the most basic attacks will be when it spews out a group of bloody projectiles from its body. They'll take to the air before arcing slowly over in your direction, but spinning your staff can let you clear them without issue.\n\nSometimes he'll throw several blood attacks into the mix one after the other to mess you up. Expect these bloody trails to come out in multiple directions (both above and from the sides) to try and confuse you, but remain focused on deflecting them as they arrive.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
