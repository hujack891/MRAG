Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu.\n\nWith the Mani Bead equipped when Chilled (ice status effect has been maxed) your critical hit chance will moderately increase. This is mostly useful in Chapter 3, thanks to it being set in the icy area, The New West.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the Mani Bead will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out.\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Mani Bead Location\n\nThe Mani Bead Curios can be found in The New West. It is randomly dropped from frozen corpses. So, you will just need to farm them until it drops from you. Mirrormere along Snowhill Path is a good spot to do this.\n\nFor even more guides and tips on finding all the items, be sure to check out our other guides. These include a breakdown of the Drinks locations, Soaks locations, where to find new Weapons, and all the Armor and Gear sets in the game.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
