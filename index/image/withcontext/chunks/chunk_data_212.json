He’s built a bit tougher than the others, and has some hard-hitting and long reaching swings with his axe, as well as a quick shove attack that’s hard to anticipate and dodge before he follows it with a chop.\n\nIf you take a few hits, remember that you have a gourd of healing drink that you can use (LB/L1) to replenish a bit of your health, but it can only be used a few times.\"\n            - Following Text: \"With both enemies dead, you should start to notice a trail of gold leading you down the main path toward a shrine in a small rocky ravine.\n\nThese Shrines are your checkpoints, and offering incense at them will allow you to rest up, refill your healing gourd, travel to other shrines, and much more (some enemies — but not all — will respawn as well). You’ll also meet the owner of the voice on the wind - the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain.\n\nThis friendly guy will be your guide and mentor for this part of the world, and will bid you to set out in search of Guanyin Temple, which burned down long ago but has since been rebuilt - but not by human hands. As the Keeper departs, he’ll bestow you with the Incense Trail Talisman, which can let you warp back to the last Shrine you rested at.\n\n## Front Hills\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
