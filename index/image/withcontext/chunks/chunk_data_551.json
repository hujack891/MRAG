Though he is not found along the main path through the Black Wind Mountain, defeating him will earn you an extremely useful Transformation Spell that should not be missed.\n\n* **Rewards:** Red Tide Transformation Spell, Stone Spirit x1, 700 Experience, 528 Will\n\n## Where to Find Guangzhi\n\nOn the other side of the bridge, head straight to find a small archway between the forest hills, and you'll find Guangzhi's lair.\n\n### Guangzhi Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe flashing of his fiery weapon may seem impossible to dodge, but the key to this fight is understanding exactly when his attacks actually land so that you can dodge around them. Guangzhi usually starts by charging forth for a combo attack, but each attack will cause him to jump into the air with a flourish before actually attacking with downward swings. Wait to dodge all three swing attacks and then hit him with some of your own while he tries to recover.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If he starts to whirl his fiery blade in circles around him, be ready but don’t panic as his attack is yet to come — wait for him to raise the blade and twirl it high before swinging it from side to side in two slower hits.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
