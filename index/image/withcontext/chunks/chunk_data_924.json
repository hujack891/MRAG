With a loud gong, the trapped \"Admiral\" will use the cymbal to awaken a giant turtle whose mountainous shell you're actually standing on.\n\nAs the turtle begins to swim through the Bitter Seal, the woman will become aware of your presence, starting this new region off with a bang of a boss fight.\n\n\nAs long as your patient to wait for the right moments to get in close and attack, and make sure you're using shock-quelling medicine, you'll be able to come out on top. Even as Kang-Jin Star tries to flee in her dragon form, the Destined One will see to it that she crashes into the large cymbals, freeing the prisoner inside!\n\nThis imprisoned Pig Guai is none other than Zhu Bajie, who traveled with Sun Wukong during his adventures in Journey to the West!\n\n\nAs you start exploring the path over to the right, an echoing voice will lead you to a large open platform where dragon humanoid figure appears to be frozen in place with its fishing rod.

This new material will unlock the upgrade path for your Loongwreathe Staff into the Golden Loong Staff, but you'll need to find and defeat the last of the four Loongs to craft it.\n\nOnce you've had your fill of exploring the \"Turtle Island\", you can head to the front where the small Pig Guai stands waiting, and interact with him for the turtle to finally make its landing at the next part of the Bitter Lake.\n\n\nStart by heading along the shore and defeating various Frozen Corpses, and look for a small building in the distance by the water's edge. As you near it, you can also spot a dragon man standing alone in the shallows. Zhu Bajie seems to know him, but as you approach, you'll be pulled into another boss fight.\n\n## Boss Fight - Chen Loong\n\nThe old dragon can be pretty agile too, leaping away to float in the air before casting a variety of electric attacks. One of these includes sending out a flurry of small electric orbs at you, though they can be deflected with a quick staff spin.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He can also raise his hand up slowly to trigger a row of lightning bolts in the area, which will explode fairly fast.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
