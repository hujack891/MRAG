Located in a secret realm locked away in the past, you'll need to activate three bells in order to locate and defeat him.\n\n* **Rewards:** Fireproof Mantle, 2,000 Will\n\n## Where to Find Elder Jinchi\n\n* **Bamboo Grove** \\- At the end of the Snake Trail area before reaching the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll face a Yaoguai Chief named Guangmou who can summon snakes to attack you. Once defeated, the path up to the next Shrine will be on the right, but if you head some some stairs to the left of the grove, you’ll find the second bell.\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Bamboo Grove** \\- Traveling through the very short region of the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll have to defeat a character boss, the Whiteclad Noble. Once he retreats, look for a path off to the left instead of heading straight into Black Wind Cave, and you’ll find a large plaza past the marsh where several Wolf Guai sit before a wolf that has been hung from a tree. Just beyond them is the final bell.\n\nNote - Before facing this boss, be sure to defeat the optional **Wandering Wight** that is found in the Forest of Wolves region of Black Wind Mountain if you haven’t faced him already. Not only does he share many attacks with this secret boss, but defeating this one will cause the Wandering Wight to disappear, and you will not be able to gain the Curio and Spirit that the Wight drops.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
