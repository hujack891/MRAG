This is the final of the Five Element Carts and will allow you to get into the Chapter's Secret Area - Bishui Cave.\n\n\nWhen you've completed the challenge of the spiked golden ball that rolls along the Ashen Pass III, you can return to the path. The firewall that was previously there will now have disappeared, and you can enter the Cooling Slope.\n\nFollow the path all the way down to the Cooling Slope Keeper's Shrine. Keep going forward past the Keeper's Shrine and look to the right. You'll see an icy archway, and a clear just before it. Head over here, past the Scorching-Fire rocks, and you'll come face to face with the final of the Five Element Carts.\n\n## Rusty-Gold Cart Boss Fight and Guide\n\nUse Immobilize when you can to stop it from zooming around and follow up with combo attacks quickly. Landing heavy attacks in this manner will knock the cart down, leaving it vulnerable to further follow-up attacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The way the cart plays with fire will also differ. It will spin around while spewing fire from the front to try and get you. When this happens, stick close to it and spin with it. If you get caught with this move, throw on the Fireproof Mantle to negate some of the fire damage. Another variation you'll see is it spitting fireballs. For this move, it will aim the fireballs and spit them out, and you can dash out of the way to miss them entirely.\n\nLastly is the difference in punches. The cart will lunge and take swipes at you but also punch the ground like the other carts. To make things trickier, it will also try to grab you.\n\nWhen it does go to take a swipe at you, try to roll toward it. You'll either end up going underneath it or to the side of it and dodging the attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
