Below you'll find a guide to accessing the kingdom of the past by undertaking the Drunk Boar's Questline to find a Sobering Stone, and how to defeat the Tiger Vanguard and secret Yaoguai King Boss, Fuban.\n\n* Jump to a Section:\n* **How to Access the Kingdom of Sahali**\n- Yaoguai Chief - \"Tiger Vanguard\"\n* **Sandgate Bound**\n- Yaoguai King - Fuban\n\nThis Chapter 2 Secret can only be accessed by meeting the Yellow-Robed Square in Fright Cliff (aka the Drunken Boar), and helping him in his search for the \"Realm of Gold\" which requires a few steps (and for you to best him in combat).\n\n\nOnce you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into the Kingdom of Sahali\n\n\nAs you round the corner, you’ll be told to halt by the defender of a large gate: A slightly familiar looking Tiger Guai who calls himself the Vanguard of the Yellow Wind King. If he looks familiar to another Vanguard you’ve faced, that’s because he’s actually the other Vanguard’s father! He’ll ask that you turn around and head home, which seems like such a waste with all you’ve gone through just to get here.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - \"Tiger Vanguard\" (Kingdom of Sahali)\n\nIf you ever see him freeze up (usually in a ready stance) hold off on attacking and instead charge up for a heavy attack when he starts to move again. If you attack too early, he’ll counter your deflected attack by whirling on you with a claw swipe, followed by a leaping downward slash with a huge arc and a delay before he lands.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He can also employ this huge sweeping arc attack by other means, most notably when he tries to plunge his sword in the ground near you, he’ll rip it out while performing a huge spin attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
