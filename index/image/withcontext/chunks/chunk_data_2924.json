These eyeballs are scattered around the land on the heads of Buddha statues. With six to find, chances are you might miss one or two in your travels across the area. Plus, when it comes to using the Buddha's Eyeballs, it can be tricky to find out what to do.\n\nThis guide covers all Buddha's Eyeball locations in Black Myth: Wukong, where to use them to unlock a secret boss, and more.\n\n\nFor a more detailed run-through of the entirety of Yellow Wind Ridge, check out our walkthrough.\n\n## Where to Use the Buddha's Eyeball in Black Myth: Wukong\n\nIf you have collected all the Buddha's Eyeballs, you won't have to travel far to use them. On your left, from the Rockrest Flat Shrine, you can find the Rock Clash Platform arena. This arena will initially spawn the Stone Vanguard boss, but if you use the Buddha's Eyeballs on the rock in the arena, you will also spawn the Shigandang boss.\"\n            - Following Text: \"You can actually spawn Shigandang alongside the Stone Vanguard and have them fight each other to knock out two birds with one stone. But, you can also fight them individually.\n\nDefeating the Stone Vanguard will give you the Sterness of Stone Key Item needed to progress through Yellow Wind Ridge using the Tallies. Defeating Shigandang will give you the Skanda of Feeling Key Item.\n\n**For more Black Myth: Wukong game help, check out:**\n\n* Things Black Myth Wukong Doesn't Tell You\n* Boss List and Guides\n* Side Questlines\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
