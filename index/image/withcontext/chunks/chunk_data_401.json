Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration.\n\n## Valley Entrance\n\nUltimately, you're going to go left to continue on the main path (and you may start to hear characters talk as you approach this pillar), but for now, you'll want to detour and explore the area to the right.\n\nThe first thing you'll see as you go to the right is the Flamlings that sit in the lava. These will spit fire at you, so it's best to deal with them to remove the ranged attacks while you explore.\n\n\nDrop down here, and head right first to collect the Fire Date from the tree. Then go in the opposite direction toward the lava streaming from the ceiling. This is where you can find one of the optional bosses in Chapter 5, the Flint Chief.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Flint Chief\n\nWhen you've beaten it collect the Flint Chief Spirit it drops and the Fire Date from the tree to the right of the lava flowing from the ceiling.\n\nFollow the lava path back up the archway, collecting more Fire Dates on the way, and be careful of Scorching and Searing-Fire enemies that will pop out along the way.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When you're back up to the arch, continue forward to the top of the slope. The path goes left and right here. Right is the main path, so for now, let's take a look at the left side. As you head over, you'll see an Earth Rakshasa waiting for you that guards a chest. It also has a Spirit for you to collect once you defeat it.\n\nAs soon as you pass by the torch, a Flamling will appear. Take down the Flamling and Rakshasa, then collect the Earth Rakshasa Spirit. After this, open the chest and collect Celestial Ribbon and a Mind Core.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
