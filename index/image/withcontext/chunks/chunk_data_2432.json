By doing so, you can unlock a secret area to explore.\n\n* Rewards: Gold Tree Core, 2274 Experience, 1927 Will\n\n\nThe Venom Daoist's boss fight is a two-part optional boss encounter that you'll first find exploring the massive Webbed Hollow Portion of Chapter 4. When in the Upper Hollow, look for a ledge to drop down leading to the Pool of Shattered Jade past several hanging cocoons. In a small tunnel past the Shrine, you'll encounter a large cocoon that holds the Venom Daoist.\n\nAfter defeating him a first time, proceed through to the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Once you reach a fork in the road where the left path leads to the Court of Illumination Shrine, look for a path leading right up a mountain trail. Once you reach the top of the stairs, you'll find an alcove to the left leading down a large slope to an arena where the rematch will occur.\n\n\nAfter taking out 2-4 of his extra limbs, he'll likely run out of health, and will beat a hasty retreat. This isn't the last you'll see of him, and in fact he's essential to unlocking a secret area, so we'll look for him again later. At the very least, you'll earn experience and will both for beating him and his cocoon!\n\n## Venom Daoist Boss Fight and Guide - Second Encounter\n\nMuch of the rest of this fight will revolve around avoiding his lengthy combo attacks and retaliating after his last hit, or quickly evading or deflecting his charging dash attacks to stop him in his tracks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once the Daoist is defeated for good, he'll impart a mysterious message, telling you to \"find the needle on Purple Cloud Mountain\". As he departs, he mural will form on the nearby wall, which you can now interact with to travel to **Chapter 4's Secret Area: Purple Cloud Mountain**. As with other Secret Areas, we recommend exploring it before you proceed to the final boss of this chapter, as it will be instrumental in helping to defeat the final boss of this area.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
