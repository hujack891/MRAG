Go down the stairs and to the end of the path to find a Meditation Spot.\n\nReturn to the Keeper's Shrine and continue past it, following the path to the right. Head down to the slope, collecting the green Wisp on the left and into the center of the room. As you reach the middle, you'll be met by the first of the bosses in this secret area.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief - Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top\n\nLike the other pairs of bosses in the chapters, you'll have them attack you in succession. You'll start with Bottom Takes Top, who will cycle through two moves. He'll leap at you -- just dodge back from this -- and then roll into the ball. You can attack him while he regains his composure when he's inside it.\n\nTo follow this, he'll put his sword away, then jump at you and slam the ball down. He'll then drag it around him. Both of these attacks can be avoided by keeping your distance. Attack when he's getting himself back together, and chip away at his health steadily.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When you've knocked his health bar down, he'll retreat and Top Takes Bottom will take over. She'll jump to get into her half of the ball and spin toward you. This will be quick, but you can dodge out of the way of this. She will also imitate Bottom Takes Top and leap up with her sword, eventually rolling into her half of the ball.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
