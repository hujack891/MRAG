Below you'll find a guide to accessing the kingdom of the past by undertaking the Drunk Boar's Questline to find a Sobering Stone, and how to defeat the Tiger Vanguard and secret Yaoguai King Boss, Fuban.\n\n* Jump to a Section:\n* **How to Access the Kingdom of Sahali**\n- Yaoguai Chief - \"Tiger Vanguard\"\n* **Sandgate Bound**\n- Yaoguai King - Fuban\n\nThis Chapter 2 Secret can only be accessed by meeting the Yellow-Robed Square in Fright Cliff (aka the Drunken Boar), and helping him in his search for the \"Realm of Gold\" which requires a few steps (and for you to best him in combat).\n\n\nOnce you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into the Kingdom of Sahali\n\n\nAs you round the corner, you’ll be told to halt by the defender of a large gate: A slightly familiar looking Tiger Guai who calls himself the Vanguard of the Yellow Wind King. If he looks familiar to another Vanguard you’ve faced, that’s because he’s actually the other Vanguard’s father! He’ll ask that you turn around and head home, which seems like such a waste with all you’ve gone through just to get here.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - \"Tiger Vanguard\" (Kingdom of Sahali)\n\nOther times, his lunging attack will be just one big leaping sword slice while low to the ground, which is easier to dodge as it has no follow up most of the time, though he will turn to this move instead of finishing some of his combo attacks to throw you off your guard.\n\nEvery so often, he’ll decline the lunge, and simply swing his sword up to send a projectile slash your way. The good news is it's rare and just a single slash, moving slow enough that it can be dodged reliably well.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Note that you can use the Rock Solid deflection spell to surprise him (since it's his own spell that he passed down to the son you gained it from) but he can also use the spell as well. It’s not as obvious as when the other boss used it, as his fur will darken but he won’t turn completely to stone.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
