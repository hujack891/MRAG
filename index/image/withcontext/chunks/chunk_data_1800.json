Secretly buried not far from another Yaoguai King, you'll need to seek out six Buddha Statue Eyeballs to unlock this boss.\n\n* **Rewards:** Heart of Stone, Skhanda of Feeling, Mind Core x1, Yaoguai Core x2, 1652 Experience, 1371 Will\n\n\n* Finally, when resting at the Rockrest Flat Shrine, you need only advance forward toward the entrance to the Stone Vanguard / Shigandang Boss Fights to find the final statue and Buddha's Eyeball.\n\n## Shigandang Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThough they appear in the same arena, the Shigandang is a much harder challenge compared to the Stone Vanguard. Because of this, it’s recommended that you save challenging this foe until you’re almost complete with Chapter 2 and have a good set of gear and medicines at your disposal to increase damage negation. He’s worth defeating before you fight the final boss of this chapter, as you’ll be able to craft a new weapon upon his defeat.\n\n### Secret - Defeat the Stone Vanguard with the Shigandang\n\nThe Shigandang has a massive attack you’ll need to be on the lookout for. He’ll start by lifting an arm and a leg, before slamming down on all fours to create a massive shockwave covering a large portion of the arena. All four of his limbs will glow, and soon after will cause a massive detonation. It is possible to avoid this with a well timed pillar stance to gain height on your staff, but you’ll need to do it away from his body or the initial blast can still knock you down or damage you regardless.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Another deadly attack he can perform will have the Shigandang stand up on two legs and alternate two delayed punches into the ground in front of him. After this, he’ll slam both hands deep into the earth, and after a pause will rip them out, creating a line of exploding pillars in front of him you’ll want to steer clear of and attack his sides or back.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
