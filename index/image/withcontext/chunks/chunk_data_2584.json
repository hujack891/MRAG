Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n## Cliff of Oblivion\n\nThere's a few Skeletal Snakes who might creep up on you here, but more important is to check behind the large stone disc through a darkened path to the right, and you'll find a **Treasure Chest** with random materials at the end of a wooden platform.\n\nUp ahead, you'll find a second rope bridge, and this one is very much a trap. It's surrounded on all sides by hanging cocoons, and sure enough, many of them are Clawed Cocoons in disguise.\"\n            - Following Text: \"To make matters worse, there's no invisible walls to stop you from falling to your death when crossing the bridge, which the Clawed Cocoons AND Dragonfly Guai archer at the far end will absolutely use to their advantage to knock you around as you try to cross. While you can use the Thrust Stance to safely poke a few early cocoons, the strategy won't hold very long, and it's almost impossible to target the actual enemies and not the regular cocoons.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
