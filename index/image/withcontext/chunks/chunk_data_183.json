Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby.\n\n\nAs you get close to the edge of the cliff, you'll find another clearing with a rock in the middle. This is the third Poison Chief in the region.\n\nWhen you've beaten the third Poison Chief, head over to the start of the red trees. As you enter the clearing with the lightning, you'll find the next Keeper's Shrine on the left.\n\n\nWhen it's defeated, head back along the river and look for the golden tree.\n\n## Mantis-Catching Swamp\n\nNow that you've cleaned up the majority of the optional bosses, it's time to find the last of the main bosses. You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis.\n\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n\n\nFrom the Mantis-Catching Swamp, fly up and back toward the area where you fought the Gold Armored Rhino and Cloudtreading Deer. We now want to stop on the left, to get the Son of Stones, which is the boss sitting at the edge of the cliff on the left with the neon blue glow.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Son of Stones\n\nLand behind the Sone of Stones on the cliff and then attack to start the fight. He won't immediately jump up, so you can get a couple of free hits in.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When he does join in, you'll want to watch out for the standard stone boss attack of swiping at you with one hand. In the Son of Stones's case, he will fall over, but will continue to roll toward you, which will damage you if you're hit by it. At the end of this attack, he has to get himself back up, so quickly Immobilize him when he's down to take advantage of the situation.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
