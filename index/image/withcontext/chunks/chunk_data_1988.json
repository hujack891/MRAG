In fact, you can actually make this into an effective build by intentionally poisoning yourself with the Deathclaw Soak, and further boosting your skills by equipping the Elder Amourworm Spirit to increase critical hit chance when poisoned, but it is a bit of a risky tradeoff.\n\nAfter resting at the Shrine, you may start to notice giant pools of blood left by something on the run, meaning the Violet Spider must have come this way.\"\n            - Following Text: \"At the top of a short stairway, you'll encounter new enemies guarding a green Wisp - a Sword Daoist. They attack with flowing sword combos and even a wave of force from certain swings, but on the plus side they aren't very durable, and a sustained light attack combo is enough to put them down.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
