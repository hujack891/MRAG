After unlocking the Gourd in Chapter 1, you can start to capture the spirits of enemies and use them in battle. But if you're searching for tips on what the best spirits to use are, here's what we'd recommend.\n\nLooking for information on every Spirit in the game and how to collect them? Visit our Spirit Locations page.\n\n## Best Spirits to Use in Black Myth: Wukong\n\nWhen you use a Spirit, you will temporarily transform into them and be able to perform their special move. Alongside these skills, each Spirit provides a boost to a general stat or status effect, such as an increase in Poison damage or an increase in Defense when performing a particular move like Rock Solid.\n\nUnlike Transformations, you will share the same health bar with Spirits, so it's crucial to pull them out at the right time. Not sure which Spirits to equip? Here are some we consider to be the best spirits to use in Black Myth: Wukong.\n\nWandering Wight| Guangmou| Tiger's Acolyte\n---|---|---\nBlade Monk| Non-White| Falcon Hermit\nClay Vajra| Flint Vanguard| Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang (Upgraded)\n\nRemember that Spirits can be upgraded! At any Keeper's Shrine, you can choose to Cultivate Spirits from the Self-Advance menu. This will allow you to upgrade your Spirits using a combination of Will and items like Blood of the Iron Bull and Tadpoles. If you like a Spirit, cultivate them so you can max out their buffs.\n\n\nThis Spirit is entirely missable if you get to the end of Chapter 1 without picking it up, but you'll also likely encounter it before you've got your Gourd. Thankfully, you can pick it up from the nearest Keeper's Shrine once you've got the Gourd, and we'd recommend you do so because it's a great one to have equipped especially in the early game.\n\nThe Wandering Wight provides a substantial buff to your defence, which can make all the difference in fights. Not only this, but its Faithful Kowtow special attack allows you to deal a chunk of damage by smashing the giant's head into an enemy.\n\n\nThis is another Spirit you can collect from Chapter 1, and with it, you can use the Veiled Vipers special attack. When you perform this, four snakes will appear to help you out, dealing poison damage to enemies.\n\nYou'll gain a moderate increase in the poison damage you deal, and have the added bonus of poison resistance alongside it. Even if you're not going up against too many enemies that use poison attacks, you will find plenty are susceptible to poison damage and the status will build up letting you chip away at an enemy's health bar while you use other moves.\n\n\nIf you want to make the most of the spells you can cast, the Gore-Eye Daoist moderately buffs your Maximum Mana levels. To complement the equipped effect, his Raging Blood attack sees him create an area that will enhance your attacks along as you stay inside the glow.\n\n\nIt's a fairly simple attack that the Tiger's Acolyte offers, but Sharp Edge is a quick hack-and-slash move that can deal a chunk of damage. In addition to the move, you'll also gain a moderate increase in Critical Damage, so using it at the right time can be a powerful attack. As another added bonus, the Qi cost of using Tiger's Acolyte is moderate, while most others are high.\n\n\nThe Slaughter attack the Blade Monk can pull out allows you to swing a huge greatsword twice and then smash it down on a foe. You'll also get a moderate attack buff as soon as you've taken down an enemy.\n\n### Non-White\"\n            - Following Text: \"Non-White's Bone Spikes attack allows him to leap forward and spin at the same time, getting close to targets quickly and hitting them. The immediate follow-up to this is he'll sprout thorns to stab an enemy, prolonging the attack. In the same way that Gangmou is useful for Poison Damage, so is the Non-White Spirit. Alongside the moderate buff to Poison Damage, you'll also get a moderate increase to Frost Damage, so aim for a two-pronged attack that allows you to inflict both elements.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
