This is the final of the Five Element Carts and will allow you to get into the Chapter's Secret Area - Bishui Cave.\n\n\nWhen you've completed the challenge of the spiked golden ball that rolls along the Ashen Pass III, you can return to the path. The firewall that was previously there will now have disappeared, and you can enter the Cooling Slope.\n\nFollow the path all the way down to the Cooling Slope Keeper's Shrine. Keep going forward past the Keeper's Shrine and look to the right. You'll see an icy archway, and a clear just before it. Head over here, past the Scorching-Fire rocks, and you'll come face to face with the final of the Five Element Carts.\n\n## Rusty-Gold Cart Boss Fight and Guide\n\nLet the cutscene play out as you approach and see the Pale-Axe Stalwart from the mouth of the cart, and then be prepared to use everything you've got against the most aggressive coffin cart of the Chapter.\n\nIt will combine the movesets from the previous three carts you've encountered and add its own to the mix. While some moves will seem familiar, others you'll need to learn to avoid.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Use Immobilize when you can to stop it from zooming around and follow up with combo attacks quickly. Landing heavy attacks in this manner will knock the cart down, leaving it vulnerable to further follow-up attacks.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
