As an optional foe, you can seek out this boss as part of the Man-in-Stone's Quest, and gain the ability to turn into a Rock Guai yourself by defeating her.\n\n* Rewards: Essence of Stone\n\n## Where to Find the Mother of Stones\n\nYou can encounter the Mother of Stones boss while exploring the Fright Cliff area, which becomes available after defeating the King of Flowing Sands and his Second Rat Prince, and then heading right to cross a rope bridge.\n\nOnce inside the Fright Cliff region, head past the Squall Hideout Shrine and keep left to enter a large cave area, and take a left turn to find the unresponsive boss.\n\n### Mother of Stones Boss Fight\n\nThis boss battle is an interesting one, simply because the giant crystal-embedded statue known as the Mother of Stones doesn’t actually fight you. It doesn’t really move at all, but it has a lot of health to slowly chip through.\n\nWhat will fight you, however, is the army of Palestones you can spot embedded in the ground and walls all around you. Make no mistake, this will be an endurance battle, as you’ll need to survive repeated encounters with more and more Palestones.\"\n            - Following Text: \"After taking enough damage, the Mother of Stones will let out a roar, signaling a Palestone will quickly appear to defend her. That’s your cue to immediately break off your attack, regain your stamina, and be ready to dodge the incoming stone monster. Survival will hinge on how well you can deal with each wave while taking minimal damage, and understanding their melee and ranged attacks.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
