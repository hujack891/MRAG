After conquering a variety of bosses and obtaining Wukong's special armor, The Destined One is ready to complete his journey. Below, you'll find a Walkthrough of the final areas of Mount Huaguo as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Water Curtain Cave**\n* **Return Path**\n* **Peak of Innocence**\n* **Birthstone - Heart of Birthstone**\n- Stone Monkey\n- The Great Sage's Broken Shell\n\n\nAfter another story from Zhu Bajie, the giant staff will shrink and you'll be able to get it from the body of water in front of you. Now that you've acquired the Jingubang and look exactly like Wukong, head to the back of the cave directly ahead.\n\nFollow the path to the peak, where you'll come to the Return Path Keeper's Shrine.\n\n\nWhen you emerge on the other side, you'll see the final stretch of the path that dips down and then slopes upward. Head for the top and activate the Peak of Innocence Keeper's Shrine, just before the end of the path.\n\n\nOn the other side, you'll find the Old Monkey. He'll tell you to step onto a boat, and then transport you across the water, while he recites the memories of Wukong.\n\n## Birthstone - Heart of Birthstone\n\nAs the cutscene sees you move toward the Stone Monkey, you'll be automatically thrown into a fight against it.\n\nNote! You won't be able to activate the Heart of Birthstone Keeper's Shrine here unless you die, but if you do, you won't need to go back to a previous shrine – you'll automatically be transported back here.\n\n\nThis fight has two phases, so be prepared for a tough battle and think about how you manage your Gourd and Spell usage throughout. You'll want to take in medicines that include Body-Warming and Body-Cooling Powder, as well as those that strengthen your attacks such as Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets and Loong Aura Amplification Pellets. You might prefer other medicines depending on the build you're playing with, such as the Mirage or Life-Saving Pill.\n\nThe first thing to note is that the Stone Monkey, like other Stone enemies, is resistant to elemental attacks, so the best thing you can do here is have a build that focuses on high attack strength and increasing the chances of critical attacks. His resistance to these attacks should also influence the Transformation you take into the fight with you – we'd recommend Ebon Flow or Azure Dust, which can both deliver heavy blows.\n\n### The Stone Monkey Phase One\n\nWhen his health is down to around 70%, he will start to disappear occasionally and quickly reappear to catch you off guard. You can watch the ripples in the water to see where he'll approach from and quickly evade.\"\n            - Following Text: \"This will also be the time when he starts to glow slightly, indicating that his attacks will begin to differ. You'll now see that when he punches down on the ground, shockwaves will be sent out. You can jump or roll over these to dodge them.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
