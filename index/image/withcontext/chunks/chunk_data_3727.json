Located in a secret realm locked away in the past, you'll need to activate three bells in order to locate and defeat him.\n\n* **Rewards:** Fireproof Mantle, 2,000 Will\n\n\n* **Bamboo Grove** \\- Traveling through the very short region of the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll have to defeat a character boss, the Whiteclad Noble. Once he retreats, look for a path off to the left instead of heading straight into Black Wind Cave, and you’ll find a large plaza past the marsh where several Wolf Guai sit before a wolf that has been hung from a tree. Just beyond them is the final bell.\n\nNote - Before facing this boss, be sure to defeat the optional **Wandering Wight** that is found in the Forest of Wolves region of Black Wind Mountain if you haven’t faced him already. Not only does he share many attacks with this secret boss, but defeating this one will cause the Wandering Wight to disappear, and you will not be able to gain the Curio and Spirit that the Wight drops.\n\n## Elder Jinchi Fight and Guide\n\nAs previously mentioned, Jinchi shares a lot of moves with the Wandering Wight. He can perform one or several spinning attacks that can be hard to judge the range of their attack, and can combo them into other moves like one or two stomp attacks, or a frighteningly fast jumping stomp attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He can also perform the palm blast wave after charging up, only Jinchi will also summon all of the wandering spirits to increase the power of his blast and delay its attack, which you’ll really want to be careful to dodge at the right time.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
