Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Ashen Pass III**\n- Boss Fight - Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n* **Cooling Slope**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n- Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\n* **Fallen Furnace Crater**\n- Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n- Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\n\nAfter defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the Yin-Yang Fish, and the Crimson-Silver Cart, you'll have climbed to the top of the Flaming Mountains and be closer to finding out where the Bull King is.\n\n\nThe gauntlet is almost over! As you continue on, there's a small gap on the left you can dart into and then it's onward toward the flames. When you approach, a cutscene will begin where you'll see the golden spiked ball go flying off the end of the cliff.\n\nAfter the cutscene, ignore Pingping running off, and turn back to where you came from. Remember the wall of flames? Head back there. Now that the ball is gone, it's safe to explore the area slowly and you'll find the flames have also disappeared. A path has been revealed, which is the Cooling Slope, and the next place we'll explore.\n\n\nCollect the green Wisps from the far edge on the left, then follow the path where the fox went toward the Bull King. This will take you down a path that leads up to the Bull King, and where you can find the next Keeper's Shrine called Fallen Furnace Crater.\n\n## Fallen Furnace Crater\n\nHead up the slope to see Pingping speak to her father. The Bull King isn't best pleased with The Destined One, but also has an issue with Pingping and her deception. It turns out that Pingping is actually the Red Boy, and he will transform before your eyes, ready for a battle.\n\n### Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n\nIf he performs the combination of moves where he twirls the spear around him, he'll perform a leap and thrust his spear into the ground, then flip toward you. When he does this, he'll follow it up immediately with a flamethrower from his hand. It's best to dodge all of this moveset, then attack.\n\nThough it's tempting to create distance, it's better to stay close to the Red Boy during this fight. Not only will this allow you to take advantage of those pauses we mentioned previously, but it also means he's less likely to use projectiles. If you're too far away, he'll shoot fire along the ground to try and reach you.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When his health reaches the halfway point, he'll launch himself up in the air. Shortly after, he'll create duplicates of himself that will appear all around him. These will launch themselves at you with their spears, resulting in an explosion. It'll start with one duplicate launching themselves at you, then two, and finally, a set of three will attack.\n\nThe best way to approach this is to stay locked on the Red Boy, but move as far back in the area as you can. If you need to, use any rocks nearby that haven't been destroyed. You can then dodge in any direction to evade the attacks and do a quick double tap of dodge when you have multiple duplicates coming at you. If you're finding it difficult to dodge the attacks, Cloudstep can help you direct some of the attention away from yourself.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
