One of several possible frog guai bosses you can defeat, this one lurks in the Valley of Ecstasy, and has the power of frost on its side.\n\n* **Rewards:** Tadpole, Cold Iron Leaves, Random Materials, 1270 Experience, 904 Will\n\n## Where to Find Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n\nAs soon as you arrive in the Forest of Felicity, you can find two small tunnels in the ridge on the left, one before and after the Shrine, and both lead to a canyon with a frozen pond where the frog boss waits for you.\n\n### Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nWhile he doesn't have a ton of health or as much defense as other bosses, he can still get even more dangerous when low on health. His standard arm attack combo can be supercharged, causing icy explosions in a line from each of his swipes, and causing his slam to build up a giant frost area below him while also boxing you in a ring of icy crystals.\n\nSurviving this can be very tough as he'll try to keep you trapped and locked in his icy lair until you can't move, and then follow up with a loud screech to explode the icy and rocks around him, or perform another follow-up attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"As with his other big attack, your Pillar Stance can help keep you away from the blast, but you can also try creating a Ring of Fire to give yourself \"holy ground\" of sorts to stay safe in from the otherwise chilly prison.\n\nDefeat this third frog menace, and you'll gain another Tadpole and other materials to upgrade your Spirits and gear.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
