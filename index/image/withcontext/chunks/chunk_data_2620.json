Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nThe easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step. Cast it near the start of the rope bridge, and then sprint all the way to the other end, and don't try to staff spin if any arrows come your way, or you're likely to walk off the side by accident.\n\n\nRather helpfully, there's a brazier by a ledge nearby, and looking down you can find a spot to drop back down to the two bridges we noted at the start of the Lower Hollow, putting you quickly back on track to the main pathway.\n\n\nBe sure to climb back up the ledges (use a jumping heavy attack to gain height), and continue to follow this path to a flooded cave where this chapter's Frog Boss awaits.\n\n\nPast this foe, you'll enter another long dark tunnel, and you can find a Puppet Spider hanging up on the right above a green Wisp to absorb, and a patrolling Lantern Holder further down the tunnel.\n\n\nOnce you're ready, head through the gate to join the party, and it seems your just in time to meet the not-so-lucky groom.\n\n## Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n\nYour old friend Zhu Bajie is not exactly himself, and now that he's been bewitched, you'll have to beat some sense into him. This is no easy task, as the scrappy little pig once journeyed with Wukong himself. This makes him a wily fighter, if a bit unorthodox.\n\nZhu Bajie prefers to attack with his special 9-pointed rake, and while it may look silly, it's absolutely dangerous. He can swing it in wide arcs in a few different ways, but he usually has a slow wind-up at first that you can dodge away from.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When his rake glows red, he'll charge up his rake attacks with explosive force. These will usually send you reeling back if you try to deflect them (or at the very least not stagger the boss), and if they hit the swings cleave into the ground, they'll cause waves of force to explode outward from his swings.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.

Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
