Below, you'll find a Walkthrough for the first major area of The Flaming Mountains called Woods of Ember, as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* ** **Ashen Pass I\n- Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Brown-Iron Cart\n* **Camp of Seasons**\n* **Height of Ember**\n- Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones\n- Yoaguai Chief - Gray-Bronze Cart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind\n* **Ashen Pass II**\n\n##  Ashen Pass I\n\nBefore you go over to them, harvest the **Fire Bellflower** by the Buddha statue on the right. Then, go straight up and into the midst of the fighting, to find the Pale-Axe Stalwart taking on nearby Revenants. Alongside the fighting, the area is also being pelted with firebombs so having the Fireproof Mantle Vessel here can help you focus more on the fighting and less on the fire attacks.\n\n### Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\n\nHe uses a huge axe, so most of his attacks are slow swings. The main approach to this fight should be to dodge the slow attacks, then immediately follow up with a combo as he takes time to recover.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Occasionally, he will kick at you or jump up in the air, raising his axe above him. When he does the latter, he will slam it down as he lands, but even with this move, dodging is still the way to go.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.

Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
