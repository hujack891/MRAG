Located at the end of the Forest of Wolves, this towering Wolf Guai will be your first true test for taking on very strong and very large boss enemies.\n\n* **Rewards:** Grey Wolf Mask, 3x Yarn, 1049 Experience, 702 Will\n\n\nThis tunnel will lead to a wooden path of scaffolding looping around to the temple entrance where this boss waits.\n\n## Lingxuzi Boss Fight and Guide\n\nHis most threatening attack comes when he disengages from the fight and jump to a nearby rooftop. He’ll jump around a bit, and then leap high into the air to bellyflop onto you, causing a large shockwave that you’ll need to time well and dodge or take a ton of damage.\n\nHe also has an uppercut grab he can sometimes employ after a dashing strike that’s hard to see coming, which can launch you into the air for a multi-hit attack that can deal a scary amount of damage. This move comes when he’s hunched over and growls, but he won’t raise his claw until it’s too late to dodge!\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once you’ve got him back on the ground, try utilizing your new Red Waves spell to fight a wolf with a wolf, and unleash the fiery spin attacks while still making sure to dodge his swipes.
