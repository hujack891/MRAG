Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the grove and learning how to cultivate Spirits, accessing a secret realm, as well as how to defeat the many bosses of this area that include Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, Guangmou, and the Whiteclad Noble.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Back Hills**\n* **Snake Trail**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Guangmo\n* **Marsh of the White Mist**\n- Boss FIght - Whiteclad Noble\n\n\nTo advance, keep heading up the stairway to cross the high bridge over the falls, where you’ll soon see the golden trail of a nearby shrine beckoning you left. Before making that turn, be sure to look to the right to find a small wooden gazebo with a small table, and open the small gold box on top to find a variety of medicines, including 2 **Tiger Subduing Pellets** , 1 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 1 **Amplification Pellet**.\n\n## Snake Trail\n\nOnce you’ve cleared the snake, check out the next area to find another Snake-Head Mushroom, and continue along the path to a field of bones. Three bodies will come to life as Skeletal Snakes. Thankfully, since it takes a moment for them to come to life, and they are fairly weak, they’ll fall to only a couple of staff strikes — usually before they can try to grab at you.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Heading down the trail from the Skeletal Snakes, you’ll find a stream where another Snake Patroller wanders, as well as an optional area you can investigate by following the stream instead of going under the bridge (though you should still look just past the bridge to find green wisp spirits to capture for a huge amount of Will).\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
