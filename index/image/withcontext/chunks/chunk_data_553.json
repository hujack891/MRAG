Though he is not found along the main path through the Black Wind Mountain, defeating him will earn you an extremely useful Transformation Spell that should not be missed.\n\n* **Rewards:** Red Tide Transformation Spell, Stone Spirit x1, 700 Experience, 528 Will\n\n## Where to Find Guangzhi\n\nOn the other side of the bridge, head straight to find a small archway between the forest hills, and you'll find Guangzhi's lair.\n\n### Guangzhi Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nAnother scary move that may take a bit of practice to understand is his pogo jump: Watch for him to raise his weapon high and vertical over his head before slamming it down, and then somersaulting forward in quick succession to bounce off the ground off his weapon. After a short pause, he’ll leap up to slam down for a third attack, and then even higher up for one last pogo slam explosion. With the last two attacks being spaced out, stand your ground to wait for the drop to dodge around, and cast Immobilize once he’s grounded to pin him down while you unleash your attacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"At range, he can still be a major problem as you learn his moves, as he can strike from a distance with very little warning. If you see him somersault backward and out of range of your strikes, don’t blindly rush in. He’ll pause for a moment, and then toss his twinblade at you like a boomerang that requires dodging as it spins toward you, and back to his hand.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
