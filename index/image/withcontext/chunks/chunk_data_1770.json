This is where you can find the Relief of the Fallen Loong, and Yellow Loong waiting at the edge of the nearby cliff.\n\n\nChapter 3 had the purple seals, but Chapter 4 has the Purple Talismans. Collecting all four and getting the final one at the Court of Illumination lets you have an early visit with the Supreme Inspector.\n\n\nWe've listed the secret bosses in Purple Cloud Mountain in a particular order because players have reported that this is a missable encounter. For that reason, we'd recommend tackling the Scorpionlord first when you're in Purple Cloud Mountain.\n\n## Daoist Mi\"\n            - Following Text: \"Daoist Mi can be found near the Petalfall Hamlet Keeper's Shrine. He'll ask you to find Violet Hail for him, which you can get from the yellow-robed enemies in the area. Return to him with Violet Hail and you'll get to fight him and gain a spell!\n\n### Don't Miss This Boss!\n\nJust like The Scorpionlord, you won't be able to fight Daoist Mi if you head straight for The Duskveil. We'd recommend tackling him second, as you make your way up to Cloudnest Peak.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
