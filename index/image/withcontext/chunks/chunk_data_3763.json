Below you'll find important tips for both exploration and combat to start you on the right foot.\n\n* **Jump to:**\n* **General Tips**\n* **Combat Tips**\n* **Exploration Tips**\n\n## General Tips\n\n* **Harvest everything you see.** You'll find plants to harvest early in your adventure, but they won't have much use until you reach Chapter 2 and find someone to teach you how to craft your own medicines. Don't wait until then to begin harvesting thoughâ€”it's still worth grabbing any you find so you can craft as much as you need when the option is available. The more supplies you have in stock, the more advantages you can bring into a fight, including buffs to attack power, damage negation, and resistance!\n\n* **Experiment with different playstyles and stances.** Since you can reset your skills at any point when resting at a Shrine, try experimenting with different playstyles or favoring specific stances if you run into a roadblock. There's skills to improve just about anything, and there's no wrong answer to investing in a particular tree.\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Upgrade and customize your gourd.** Your healing gourd can have a lot of customization the deeper you get into your adventure. You'll be able to find different Gourds that can have a certain amount of use or extra effect, Drinks that can heal you all at once or over time, and Soaks that provide additional effects along with the health boost. Try tailoring the Soak or Drink to your current challenge: a higher health boost at the cost of healing over time is better when exploring versus going against a fast-paced boss, and certain soaks may allow you to gain resistance to a certain enemy attack.\n\n* **Once your Gourd has been upgraded to absorb Spirits, you can also gain an additional benefit: Absorbing Green Wisps**. Not only does this get you Will, but replenishes an additional use for your Gourd. If you defeat a tough enemy or Miniboss that leaves behind its Spirit, you'll replenish your entire Gourd once it's claimed!\n\n* **Not every enemy respawns when you rest at a Shrine.** Certain unique enemies or encounters, or those who grant a Spirit when killed won't respawn. The same goes for very tough enemies like the Bandit Chief in the Forest of Wolves, and the Wolf Assassins in the Black Wind Cave.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
