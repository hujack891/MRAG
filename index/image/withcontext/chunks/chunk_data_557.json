This boss frequently launches itself up into the air, crashing back down on you to deal massive damage. It also has an air slice attack where it beats its wings, creating blades of air that rocket toward you.\n\nCasting immobilize on the Apramana Bat when it's grounded is a good way to get enough time to land some hits before it leaps into the air again, but make sure you don't cast it too early. If you freeze the Apramana Bat in the air, you might not be able to reach it with your attacks.\n\n## Apramana Bat Spirit\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Frost Blade**\n* Equipped Effect: None\n\nThe Apramana Bat Spirit allows you to take the form of the bat, launching yourself up into the air and beating your wings, creating an X-shaped slice of frosty air to damage your target with. This can potentially freeze the target solid if you've dealt enough frost damage beforehand. This is a powerful attack, but the Apramana Bat is the only Spirit without an equipped effect, which is a bit of a downside for this Spirit.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
