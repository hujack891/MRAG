Responsible for the \"beguiling chant\" that curses you in the Pagoda Realm, you can find this boss inside the Mani Wheel at the top of the prison.\n\n* **Rewards:** Spirit of Captain Wise-Voice, Mind Core\n\n## Where to Find Captain Wise-Voice\n\nCaptain Wise-Voice is one of the four captains you can find in Chapter 3, and is a required boss to escape the prison of the Pagoda Realm. You can reach him by escaping up through the four levels of the Pagoda Prison and past the Outside the Wheel Shrine.\n\n### Captain Wise-Voice Boss Fight and Guide\n\nMuch like Captain Lotus-Vision, the second Captain of the Pagoda Realm is a creepy one, with a strange construct-like shape with four legs, housing an golden sphere adorned with dragons that serves as its central core. The rest of the construct is highly resistant to damage, meaning you'll need to stun it so that you can take a shot at its most vulnerable part.\n\nOnly one of its legs is susceptible to attack, where you can see an orange glow emanating from its front right leg, so try to focus your attacks there whenever possible to try and stagger it.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Captain Wise-Voice has a lot of unorthodox attacks, made by violently spinning its golden sphere of a head around to emit thin beams of light. If you start to see beams erupt in different directions, start strafing to get distance, and prepare to dodge or sprint away when all the beams finally flash down in your direction at the same time.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
