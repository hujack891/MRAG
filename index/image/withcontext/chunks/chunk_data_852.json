The Keeper of the Flaming Mountains is a master of deception and uses his Yin-Yang ability to produce more than just the Yin-Yang Fish in this showdown.\n\n\nFrom The Emerald Hall Keeper's Shrine, go left and up the stairs. A cutscene will start to play, where you'll transform into a Cicada and fly toward the center of the hall. This is where you'll find Pingping speaking to her mother, Rakshasi, accompanied by the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains.\n\nAfter they discuss The Destined One obtaining the relics, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains offers to care for Rakshashi, which Pingping protests. After he binds Pingping, Rakshashi is revealed to be Zhu Bajie transformed and it's time to take on the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains for yourself.\n\n## Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and Yin-Yang Fish Boss Fight and Guide\n\nWhen he's almost dead, he will then summon Ma Tianba for you to fight against.\n\n### Missable Transformation Spell\n\nYou'll see the Yin-Yang Fish rear itself up from the water and spray a jet at you, or flip itself up and over, to try and hit you with a tail flick. Staying close to it will stop it from being able to hit you with the jet spray, but will make it more likely to try and tail-whip you.\n\nIt will also use projectiles and throw out orbs to chase you down. These can be dodged or outrun in a similar manner to that of the Keeper of the Flaming Mountain's attacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When you've knocked its health down to almost halfway, it will begin to move quite erratically and cover a large amount of distance across the arena. Use Cloudstep to catch up to it and sneakily attack and Immobilize to temporarily halt it from darting off.\n\nThis is also when it will begin to float up in the air and throw the projectiles down. You'll need to dodge in quick succession to avoid these.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.
