As an optional foe, you can seek out this boss in the Yellow Wind Formation through one of three possible entrances to where the Chapter Boss resides behind sealed stone gates.\n\n* Rewards: Gore-Eye Daoist Spirit\n\n## Where to Find the Gore-Eye Daoist\n\nHowever, in order to open the door, you will need both the Sterness of Stone from the Stone Vanguard Boss, and Keeness of Tiger from the Tiger Vanguard Boss. With both Key Items, you'll be able to interact with the Tally in front of the door and open it, and you'll find the boss after crossing a bridge down to the Windseal Gate.\n\n### Gore-Eye Daoist Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nTry to keep him boxed in if possible — getting his back stuck to a wall can severely limit how much blood he can expel from his eyeballs, and stop the projectiles from seeking you out. Use stunning, staggering, and heavy hits to keep him off-balance and unable to cast his spells, and he’ll fall before long.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Defeating him will earn you his Gore-Eye Daoist Spirit to absorb, and you can also help yourself to the second Luojia Fragrant Vine in this chapter to boost your gourd yet again!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
