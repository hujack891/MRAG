Instead use your Cloud Step to get around and sneak attack.\n\n## Squall Hideout\n\n\nThe large cave entrance has a few paths, with the outer one on the right leading past another Pitstone to a wooden coffin chest holding 3 **Silk** and some **Will**.\n\n\nStart by luring the shieldless Spearbone out of range of the Blazebones above, then climb the stairs to rush down the projectile throwers. Be sure to look at the ruined home at the first landing below the first Blazebone for a yellow chest that has 2 **Yaoguai Core** and 3 **Tiny Piece of Gold**.\n\n### The Third Buddha’s Eyeball\nFight your way to the top of the stairs and keep staff spinning to deflect the ranged attacks until all the Blazebones are dead. At the end of this high raised wooden platform you’ll find another of the giant statue heads, allowing you to take its Buhdda’s Eyeball.\"\n            - Following Text: \"As you grab the eye, you may hear someone calling out to you from down below. Backtrack down to the crevice entrance, and head under the bridge, while watching for ambushes by a new stone enemy variant. The Poisestone is a much smaller and more agile version of the Palestone, able to dash around and expel poison projectiles. Defeating it will remove the stone body, but the legs will survive, and start to deploy devastating kicks if you don’t lock them down and destroy them.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
