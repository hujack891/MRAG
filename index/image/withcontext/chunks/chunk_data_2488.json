The leader of the Spider Guai and master of The Webbed Hollow, the Violet Spider and her six daughters control this region, and their mother has particular plans for the pig known as Zhu Bajie.\n\n* Rewards: Spider Leg, Refined Iron Sand, 3410 Experience, 2608 Will\n\n\nThe Violet Spider is a required and non-missable boss in Chapter 4. She is the final boss of the Webbed Hollow Section, and must be defeated to progress to the next area. After you have reached the Lower Hollow and defeated Zhu Bajie to free him of his bewitching curse, he'll be abducted again.\n\nTo reach him (and the Violet Spider), you'll need to ascend the Purfiying Spring outside the Hut of Immortality, and follow the trail upwards to The Gathering Cave where the spider queen awaits you.\n\n## Violet Spider Boss Fight and Guide\n\nIf this happens, you'll suddenly be transported to an illusory realm where you're on a bed of webs instead of solid ground. This can get extremely bad as the more you move around, the more you'll be slowed until eventually you'll be exposed as you try and break free of the webbing.\n\nExpect the Violet Spider to absolutely take advantage of your vulnerability in these moments, attacking with both her talons and a large jump slam attack that even staggers her for a bit. You'll need to stand your ground and use Rock Solid to knock away her blasts if you're unable to dodge them in time.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The good news is this phase doesn't last forever, but you will need to survive it for about 30 seconds, so you should also consider utilizing Immobilize to trap her in place, or even a Transformation Spell to offload the damage onto a different form.\n\nHer eyes will stop glowing after you've been mesmerized once, so once the room is back to normal, continue to dodge her projectiles and get your hits in after her violent stabs and slam attacks.\n\nWhen the queen of spiders finally falls to your assault, she'll beat a hasty retreat to return to wherever she's hidden the Sage's Relic. You'll need to follow quickly, because a literal spider army will appear to give chase!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
