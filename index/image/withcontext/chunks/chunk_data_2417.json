By doing so, you can unlock a secret area to explore.\n\n* Rewards: Gold Tree Core, 2274 Experience, 1927 Will\n\n\nThe Venom Daoist's boss fight is a two-part optional boss encounter that you'll first find exploring the massive Webbed Hollow Portion of Chapter 4. When in the Upper Hollow, look for a ledge to drop down leading to the Pool of Shattered Jade past several hanging cocoons. In a small tunnel past the Shrine, you'll encounter a large cocoon that holds the Venom Daoist.\n\nAfter defeating him a first time, proceed through to the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Once you reach a fork in the road where the left path leads to the Court of Illumination Shrine, look for a path leading right up a mountain trail. Once you reach the top of the stairs, you'll find an alcove to the left leading down a large slope to an arena where the rematch will occur.\n\n## Venom Daoist Boss Fight and Guide - First Encounter\n\nIf you see him hold his sword to the side but one sword high up behind his back, it means he's going to charge at you at a very fast speed. Dodge to the side, but then be ready for a second dash to come soon after requiring you to dodge once more. Try dodging alongside his second dash or lure him into a corner, and you'll find time to hit him while he resets himself.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When up close, he'll usually either perform an overhand slash followed by a leaping attack, or he'll pull back his swords to your left for two quick slashes followed by a dash attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
