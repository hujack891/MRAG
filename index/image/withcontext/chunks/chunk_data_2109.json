You'll jump into this fight as soon as you finish against The Stone Monkey, and it's the final one needed to see the ending of the game.\n\n\nYou'll start this fight as soon as you finish the one against The Stone Monkey.\n\n## The Great Sage's Broken Shell Boss Fight and Guide\n\nWe'd recommend having Ring of Fire equipped, so you can match him, and upgrade it as much as possible. Strangely enough, if you step into his Ring of Fire, you can also use it to build your Focus.\n\nHowever, you may prefer to use Spell Binder (if you've unlocked it) and increase your Attack and Critical Hit Chance. We'd also suggest using Plantain Fan again in this phase. You should also use Medicines like the Loong Aura Amplification Pellets, Ginseng Pellets, and Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets to buff your Focus gain and attack.\n\n\nAs mentioned, the Great Sage will use multiple stances, and you'll occasionally see him climb his staff to perform Pillar Stance. This is not to evade your attacks but is just a way to slam down on you from above. As you see the staff start to bend toward you, get ready to dash away.\n\nFinally, be mindful of where you stand in this fight. If you're too far from him, he'll throw out his staff as a spinning projectile, or swap to Thrust Stance to attack you. It's best to stick close to him but jump back when he performs perfect dodges or throws out Pluck of Many.\n\nJust like the Stone Monkey, once you've got his health bar down all the way, phase two will begin.\n\n### The Great Sage's Broken Shell Phase Two\n\nAt the start of this phase, the Great Sage will remove your relics from you, so you'll lose the buffs you selected when unlocking them. This is when you'll want to rely more on your Medicines, Curios, and Spells, especially Ring of Fire to build up your focus quickly. It can be much harder to hit him during this phase, so you'll need to play it somewhat safe to build up your focus.\n\nYou also need to be careful when using your Gourd at this stage. When you do, it's best to dodge to be safe but try to limit your use of it. This is because the Great Sage can Immobilize you and steal your Gourd for himself.\"\n            - Following Text: \"In this phase, you'll generally see the same attacks as the first phase, but there will of course be additional variations or they will be heightened. One of these changes includes the Great Sage's Broken Shell climbing to the top of his staff just like before, but this time, unleashing a flurry of projectiles. Tap dodge and roll to the side quickly to avoid this and build up focus while doing so. Then be prepared for him to slide down toward you, skim the water, and quickly dash back at you to try for another hit.\n\nHis combos will also become more aggressive and dangerous, and you'll see him jump up in the air and spin his staff multiple times. It will glow red as he smashes it down, and you'll need to dash out of the way to avoid it doing huge amounts of damage.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
