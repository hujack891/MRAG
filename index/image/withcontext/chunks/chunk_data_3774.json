When you reach a certain point, the Father of Stones miniboss will jump over the wall near the door on the right.\n\n## Father of Stones Boss Fight and Guide\n\nFather of Stones will use a variety of attacks in this fight, however, he's limited by the fact that he's holding a skeleton in one arm. This means he'll only ever try to hit you with one arm, giving you more opportunity to evade attacks or dodge them.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The first thing to watch out for is him swinging his arms in a combination move. He will lazily swing an arm at you a few times. But these can be dodged or missed entirely if you step back far enough. Alternatively, he will reach out to try and hit you, and often falls down straight away after performing the attack. As it takes a little while for him to recover, you can get your own combo of attacks in here.\n\nHe will sometimes leap in the air and try to land on you. Again, these can be dodged and ignored by stepping back. This is actually the case for most of his attacks, so bait him out to hit you and then take advantage of the slow recovery. If you stand behind him too long though, he'll sit down and quickly push himself toward you, rolling over and over to try and catch you.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
