To defeat him while taking minimal damage, keep your distance and wait for him to charge at you with his shield. Wait until he is right in front of you with his shield raised and dodge to the side. Turn around quickly, run to Spearbone, and land a combo on his back before he turns back around. Repeat this process until he is bested.\n\n## Spearbone Spirit\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Evil Banisher**\n* Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Damage Reduction.\n\nSpearbone's Spirit Power allows you to embody him for just long enough to use his iconic shield charge move. This is likely to stagger most enemies after, leaving you free to land another combo before they recover. The equipped effect Spearbone offers increases Damage Reduction, but only by a very marginal amount.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
