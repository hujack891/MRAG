With a loud gong, the trapped \"Admiral\" will use the cymbal to awaken a giant turtle whose mountainous shell you're actually standing on.\n\nAs the turtle begins to swim through the Bitter Seal, the woman will become aware of your presence, starting this new region off with a bang of a boss fight.\n\n\nAs long as your patient to wait for the right moments to get in close and attack, and make sure you're using shock-quelling medicine, you'll be able to come out on top. Even as Kang-Jin Star tries to flee in her dragon form, the Destined One will see to it that she crashes into the large cymbals, freeing the prisoner inside!\n\nThis imprisoned Pig Guai is none other than Zhu Bajie, who traveled with Sun Wukong during his adventures in Journey to the West!\n\n\nAs you start exploring the path over to the right, an echoing voice will lead you to a large open platform where dragon humanoid figure appears to be frozen in place with its fishing rod.

As you near it, you can also spot a dragon man standing alone in the shallows. Zhu Bajie seems to know him, but as you approach, you'll be pulled into another boss fight.\n\n## Boss Fight - Chen Loong\n\nReturn to Chen Loong (who now stands outside the shack by the water), and deliver the pellet to him. The old dragon will be overjoyed at your gift, and in return will pass along The Ruyi Scroll to you. He'll proclaim that he now has the strength to unseal the Painted Realm, where he and his fellow deities will now reside -- and you're invited!\n\n### The Zodiac Village of the Painted Realm\n\nBefore heading back to the North Shore Shrine, be sure to check the large pool of water to the left of the treasure hunter. There's a **Treasure Chest** at the foot of the pool that holds various materials, and at the far end, you can find a small rock with a Gourd Drink placed upon it: **Bluebridge Romance**!\"\n            - Following Text: \"While it can't be upgraded from its base of 36% health restored, it not only increases your movement speed after drinking, but can hold up to three different Soaks, making it an incredibly versatile Gourd Drink to equip for boss fights!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
