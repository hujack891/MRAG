Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby.\n\n\nAs you get close to the edge of the cliff, you'll find another clearing with a rock in the middle. This is the third Poison Chief in the region.\n\nWhen you've beaten the third Poison Chief, head over to the start of the red trees. As you enter the clearing with the lightning, you'll find the next Keeper's Shrine on the left.\n\n## Deer Sight Forest\n\nActivate the Deer Sight Forest Keeper's Shrine and go toward the lightning and red tree in the middle of the clearing. Underneath the tree sits the Cloudtreading Deer.\n\n\nHead back to the Keeper's Shrine once you've defeated the deer. Fly up high again, and look straight ahead for another rocky part of the cliff. It'll be hard to see from here, but fly straight forward and you should see a distinctive tall white tree. Next to it is a clearing, where you can find the final Poison Chief.\n\n\nYou know the drill with the Poison Chiefs at this stage, where heavy attacks, Immobilize, and the Plantain Fan can all help to make short work of it. Once you're done with the final one, hop back onto the Somersault Cloud.\n\nFly up and face toward the water. You'll be heading right along the river, to reach the next main boss. But before you go there, there's another optional boss to take care of.\n\nYou can actually find multiple of the Water-Wood Beasts along the way, but there's only one where the health bar appears where you fight it, and it's much bigger than the others, which is why we've just included the one here.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Water-Wood Beast\n\nYou can then detransform and follow up with your own strong attacks and it will continue to burn for a while until it douses itself off with the water.\"\n            - Following Text: \"As its health starts to get low, it will dive into the water and behave similarly to Jiao-Loong of Waves, where it will try to dive up and catch you by surprise. You'll see it emerge and peek up before it disappears again and the ground begins to rumble. You'll be able to see ripples in the water, that show you the exact path the beast is taking to reach you.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
