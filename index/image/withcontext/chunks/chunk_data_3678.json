This character will ask you to complete a side quest for him that will unlock Chapter 2’s Secret Area: The Kingdom of Sahali.\n\n\nIn this large open field, you’ll find a friendly boar-like Guai resting on a rock. He’s apparently extremely inebriated, and needs you to help him find something to sober him up. He’ll mention “**Windrest** ” if you talk to him again, providing a clue to where you can find such an ingredient.\n\n\nOn the left side when looking at the large building, defeat a Blazebone monster, and then look to the right for a **small alcove** , where you can spot a **glowing pot**. Break the pot, and you’ll find the **Sobering Stone**.\n\n\nThis “senior brother” is the First Prince of Flowing Sands — aka the giant rat Yaoguai Chief that you can fight in the **Valley of Despair** on the road from Sandgate Village to the **Crouching Tiger Temple**. If you didn’t kill the rat king, **he’ll summon the prince to fight you**. Otherwise, you can use the **Pungent Flesh Chunk** to summon and defeat him yourself.\n\nHe’ll drop the **Arhat Gold Piece** when defeated, which is the gold the Boar needs.\n\n## Return to Rockrest Flat\"\n            - Following Text: \"Though he doesn’t say where he’s going, the Boar will actually return to **near where you first met him** at the **Rockrest Flat** area of the Fright Cliff. However, instead of sitting on a rock, he’ll now be standing over by the stairs leading to a large door you can’t access yet.\n\nUnfortunately, he’s not too pleased that you’re in possession of the gold, and the Yellow-Robed Squire will challenge you to a duel!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
