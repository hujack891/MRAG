Located at the far end of the Fright Cliff, you'll first have to fetch several items for this Drunken Boar before you can fight him to unlock a Secret Area.\n\n* **Rewards:** Snout Mask, 1102 Experience, 1037 Will\n\n\nFinally, the Yellow-Robed Squire will return to near where you first met him, looking for a missing Gold Piece held by one of the Rat Princes. You can find this by defeating the First Prince of Flowing Sands in the Valley of Despair, and obtaning the Arhat Gold Piece from him. Return to Rockrest Flat, and the boar will fight you for the gold.\n\n## Yellow-Robed Squire Boss Fight and Guide\n\nIf you try to pull back too far away from him, he also has a few more sandy surprises. Instead of crafting a ring blade, he can also summon a spear of sand behind his back that glows as it appears, and then he’ll launch it at you extremely fast.\"\n            - Following Text: \"A good tactic to employ for this fight is to use the Thrust Stance’s retreating move after a combo when his sand comes out, and then follow up with a heavy thrust attack at range. It will move you out of the blinding sand, and also away from most of his claw swipe attacks. Without the sand masking his moves, he’s not overly tough, and you’ll be able to best him in this duel.\n\nUpon defeat, he’ll relent and offer to let you join him in exploring the Realm of Gold together, before vanishing off behind the giant gate. You’ll also earn the Snout Mask head gear, which has an interesting effect on raising and lowering attack power based on gourd use.\n\nOnce you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into Chapter 2’s Secret Area: The Kingdom of Sahali.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
