This water-based dragon is a fan of quick moves and tail whips to try and catch you off guard.\n\n\nAfter defeating the Supreme Celestial Inspector, you'll gain the Somersault Cloud ability. You'll start near the edge of the cliff, in the wide-open area of the Foothills. From the edge of the cliff, look straight down to see a pool of water. Go down and to the center of this water to fight our first optional boss, Jiao-Loong of Waves.\n\n## Jiao-Loong of Waves Boss Fight and Guides\n\nWhen its health has been knocked down past the halfway mark, it will start to dive into the water where you won't be able to reach it. It will move underneath the surface to try and dive up and attack you. Look for where the water is rippling to work out where it'll emerge.\"\n            - Following Text: \"It will dive in and out a few times, then its huge tail will appear from the water to try and hit you. This will appear almost tentacle-like, and there can be overlap which means you're dodging more than one at once.\n\nThankfully, with a limited range of attacks and a fairly straightforward way to avoid them, Jiao-Loong of Waves shouldn't require too much to take it down. Don't feel the need to conserve your spells during this fight; take advantage of them to quickly take down this miniboss.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
