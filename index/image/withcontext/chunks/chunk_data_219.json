You’ll also meet the owner of the voice on the wind - the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain.\n\nThis friendly guy will be your guide and mentor for this part of the world, and will bid you to set out in search of Guanyin Temple, which burned down long ago but has since been rebuilt - but not by human hands. As the Keeper departs, he’ll bestow you with the Incense Trail Talisman, which can let you warp back to the last Shrine you rested at.\n\n## Front Hills\n\nGoing left should lead you to another Wolf Swordsworn behind a rock sculpture, and a **Gentian** plant near him that you can harvest.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Further down by the stream, you can spy a curious sight - a small Rat Guai will be looking around a small stone statue head at the end of the stream, before scurrying out of sight. If you go to check out what he was interacting with, you can touch the stone head to gain the **Skandha of Form** Key Item. Its purpose isn’t known just yet, but might be worth hanging onto…\n\nHead upstream to find another Purple **Lingzhi** by a broken tree, and two Wolf Scouts off to the right of the stream guarding a **Gentian** plant.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
