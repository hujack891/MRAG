The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems.\n\n\nAs you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple. A long slope here will send you down to a large arena, and its here you'll have your second and final encounter with an old foe - the Venom Daoist.\n\n\nBefore you do, you should also head through the nearby gateway to find a large field with a giant tree in the middle. Off on the right, you can find a wooden ledge overlooking the mountains with a **Treasure Chest** full of random materials and a Soul Remigration Pill.\n\n\nHead back to the altar, and pluck what should be the fourth and final talisman. Before you can celebrate this act, a large winged monster with a hand for a face will appear to aggressively punish you for this deed!\n\n\nNow that you've done all there is to do here, you can return to rest at the Shrine, and head toward the large field to finally catch up to the Violet Spider and her master, the Hundred-Eyed Daoist.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master\n\nIf you see him perform an extravagant twisting somersault through the air, don't be dazzled, as he'll chain this feinting maneuver into a quick grab once he touches back on the ground and take a few step, lunging extra distance to try and yank you forward and take off a huge portion of your health with his crazy unblockable grab attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"This is a good time to use your best Transformation Spell to help whittle down his health, especially if you're worried about the grab or are electrified and need to retreat. The Golden Lining transformation is a good bet for its shock resistance, and many of his massive attacks are slow enough that you can \"see through\" them to build up focus points and blast him back. If you haven't beaten Yellow Loong or aren't sure about his moves, you can also use Hoarfrost or Umbral Abyss to try freezing him, just be sure to keep on top of dodging his big blasts.\n\nThe last piece of his health bar is by far the scariest to take down, and you'll need to constantly be watching his electrified talismans to anticipate where his next big blast is coming from. If you have extra mana, you can also try going for the Pluck of Mana, or just focus on more Immobilizations and Rock Solid Deflections.\n\nOnce you've finally defeated the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, you'll be treated to the finale of the Spider Sisters and their mother. Note that you'll now gain all the Yaoguai Chief entries for the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Sister (despite you not having actually fought against them).\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
