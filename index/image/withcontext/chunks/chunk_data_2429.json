By doing so, you can unlock a secret area to explore.\n\n* Rewards: Gold Tree Core, 2274 Experience, 1927 Will\n\n\nThe Venom Daoist's boss fight is a two-part optional boss encounter that you'll first find exploring the massive Webbed Hollow Portion of Chapter 4. When in the Upper Hollow, look for a ledge to drop down leading to the Pool of Shattered Jade past several hanging cocoons. In a small tunnel past the Shrine, you'll encounter a large cocoon that holds the Venom Daoist.\n\nAfter defeating him a first time, proceed through to the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Once you reach a fork in the road where the left path leads to the Court of Illumination Shrine, look for a path leading right up a mountain trail. Once you reach the top of the stairs, you'll find an alcove to the left leading down a large slope to an arena where the rematch will occur.\n\n\nAfter taking out 2-4 of his extra limbs, he'll likely run out of health, and will beat a hasty retreat. This isn't the last you'll see of him, and in fact he's essential to unlocking a secret area, so we'll look for him again later. At the very least, you'll earn experience and will both for beating him and his cocoon!\n\n## Venom Daoist Boss Fight and Guide - Second Encounter\n\nBe wary when he assumes a crouched stance with his swords up. He'll start walking forward while performing a series of twirling slashes, which can be tough to avoid as all six slashes come out very rapidly, so keep your distance or try to deflect them.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If his stance moves into holding both swords up high, he'll perform a similar combo string of four quick hits, followed by twirling both blades around him as moves forward to perform a final double slash that hits extremely hard -- again, making staying out of range your best bet.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
