Below you'll find a guide to accessing the kingdom of the past by undertaking the Drunk Boar's Questline to find a Sobering Stone, and how to defeat the Tiger Vanguard and secret Yaoguai King Boss, Fuban.\n\n* Jump to a Section:\n* **How to Access the Kingdom of Sahali**\n- Yaoguai Chief - \"Tiger Vanguard\"\n* **Sandgate Bound**\n- Yaoguai King - Fuban\n\nThis Chapter 2 Secret can only be accessed by meeting the Yellow-Robed Square in Fright Cliff (aka the Drunken Boar), and helping him in his search for the \"Realm of Gold\" which requires a few steps (and for you to best him in combat).\n\n\nOnce you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into the Kingdom of Sahali\n\n\nAs you round the corner, you’ll be told to halt by the defender of a large gate: A slightly familiar looking Tiger Guai who calls himself the Vanguard of the Yellow Wind King. If he looks familiar to another Vanguard you’ve faced, that’s because he’s actually the other Vanguard’s father! He’ll ask that you turn around and head home, which seems like such a waste with all you’ve gone through just to get here.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - \"Tiger Vanguard\" (Kingdom of Sahali)\n\nHe can also employ this huge sweeping arc attack by other means, most notably when he tries to plunge his sword in the ground near you, he’ll rip it out while performing a huge spin attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Another attack he employs frequently begins when he pivots his body by spinning into an over the shoulder claw swipe, which he’ll quickly follow through by swiping back upwards, and then kick outward after a short delay. You can parry the first below with Rock Solid when you see him spin to completely throw him off of the whole combo.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
