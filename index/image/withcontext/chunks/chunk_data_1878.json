Completing her side quest will unlock a secret boss for you to take on and a unique Curio.\n\n## Where to Find the Snow Fox\n\nApproach the body and interact with it, to learn about the fox guai whose soul resides in it. You'll need to keep prompting the fox to talk throughout this interaction, to learn the entire story of the fox being caught in a hunter's trap and rescued by a young scholar. Despite the fox trying to thank the scholar by helping him, the scholar ended up taking the fox's life. With revenge in mind, the fox has managed to track down the scholar, who is now a monk in the New Thunderclap Temple â€“ a place you'll conveniently be visiting soon.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When the story is over, examine the body and the fox will beg you to transform and wear the fur so you can confront the monk. After this, you'll automatically become the fox, and receive a Snow Fox Brush special item.\n\n### Returning to Fox Form\n\nMuch like previous transformations, if you're in this state and are hit, you'll automatically return back to your original form. The difference with this instance, however, is that you can rest at a Keeper's Shrine and then use the Snow Fox Brush from your inventory to return to fox form.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
