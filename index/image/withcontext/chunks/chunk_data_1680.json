Located at the very end of Chapter 1 at the top of Black Wind Mountain, this is the second of two forms you'll fight the self-imposed King. Now in the form of a giant bear, he'll harness the power of fire to try and burn you alive.\n\n* **Rewards:** Craving Eyes Relic, Flame Ebongold, Yarn x5, Silk x2, Spirit Stone x1, Yaoguai Core x1, Mind Core x1, 1641 Experience, 990 Will\n\n\nAs a required boss, you won't be able to miss running into the Black Wind King. You can find him at the very end of the chapter by progressing through Black Wind Cave and up the mountain, past all of the wolf defenses until you reach Bodhi Peak.\n\n## Black Bear Guai Boss Fight and Guide\n\nTo make matters worse, Black Bear Guai can and will utilize his black wind magic to teleport around the arena, and pop out of thin air in the middle of a two-hit charge attack you’ll need to evade with little warning.\n\nEven without the wind form, it can be hard to tell which moves the black bear is using when you’re right underneath him, so be sure not to get too far into your attacks that you can’t tell when he’s preparing a new attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"There’s more than a few attack combos he can launch at close range, including two-hit swipes, which are sometimes followed by a raised foot slam afterward. Later in the fight, he can extend this combo with more slashes before finally slamming his foot down.\n\nHe can also simply belly flop down, requiring you to dodge to the side rather than backwards.This move can come from the front, as well as from the sides if he collapses on his side, meaning even if you aren’t attacking from the front you won’t automatically be safe.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
