Not to be confused with his brother, the Tiger Vanguard of the Crouching Tiger Temple, you can only reach this boss by following the trail of a ghostly boy using the Old Rattle-Drum Key Item.\n\n* Rewards: Mad Tiger Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Yaoguai Core x1, Stone Spirit x1, 1102 Experience, 1023 Will, Plaguebane Gourd (in chest)\n\n\nUsing the Rattle-Drum here one final time will cause the spirit of the boy to appear before you, and invite you to hop down the well to meet a “friend”. Unfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there.\n\n## Mad Tiger Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe Mad Tiger will begin the fight with a fast leap, landing with a slashing single blow you’ll need to dodge and then retaliate.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Other times, he’ll perform a feinting strike by leaping to one side of you with an uppercut, and then changing direction to slam down after a delay in your direction.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
