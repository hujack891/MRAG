Luckily, for all his size, his attacks come with clear telegraphs to help you dodge and counter his moves.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He’ll usually start the fight with a big leaping strike, falling to the ground with one slash, and then quickly following up with a second slash from his other claw. Unfortunately, he’s a pretty evasive foe, and finding the right moments to counter attack can be tricky.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
