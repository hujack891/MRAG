The leader of the Temple of Yellow Flowers and master of the Spider Guai, he is the final boss of the larger Webbed Hollow region.\n\n* Rewards: Golden Glowing Eye, Sky-Piercing Horn, Celestial Ribbon, Fine Gold Thread, Gold Tree Core, Kun Steel, Mind Core, 5329 Experience, 3693 Will\n\n\nThe Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master is a main Yaoguai King, and the final boss you'll encounter in Chapter 4. You'll find him by following the blood trail of the Crimson Spider through the Temple of Yellow Flowers.\n\nOnce you reach the Court of Illumination, you'll find a pathway to the right that leads to a large field where the final boss is located.\n\n## Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe attack won't stop there, as once he re-burrows, you'll need to keep your eyes and ears peeled. After a brief moment, his electrified sword will come hurtling in from a corner of the arena with a small lightning strike noise, and you'll need to dodge it as it embeds itself in the ground. Stay clear of the impact site, as the boss will then burrow out to grab it and perform a quick double slash with the electrified blade before spinning about (at which you should then hop in and attack).\"\n            - Following Text: \"As the fight rages on, expect him to employ a wider variety of both sword and electric attacks with his talismans, employing new combos to slice or slam, and then shoot out electric blasts or imbue his sword for bigger hits. One move to be wary of seems easy enough at first, as he'll charge up his sword by holding it close to his left side, and then unleash an upward lighting slash to his right. However, he'll immediately grab at you with his free hand, and squeeze the life out of you if you are too close to him following that first slash.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
