An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n## Village Entrance\n\nBefore heading into the village, it’s time to finally find a use for all those plant materials you’ve been gathering. Look just beyond the shrine for a small ditch running under a wooden bridge. You can explore the left side to find a sloping path up to a green Wisp to absorb, and where a mushroom is actually a Lingzhiling creature in disguise. Watch for its poisonous attacks, and kill it to earn a large variety of mushroom items. The ditch also leads below the town’s large gate, but aside from Fragrant Jade Flower to harvest, there’s not much else down here.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Follow the ditch through the opposite path under the bridge, and head right to a tunnel. Inside, apart from a green Wisp you can absorb for some Will and a mushroom to harvest, you can spot a grubby yet friendly canine deity.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
