Located between the Forest of Ferocity and the Temple Entrance itself, this boss trains a group of Daoists who will all try to stop you.\n\n* Rewards: Commander Beetle Spirit, Knot of Voidness, Refined Iron Sand, 1562 Experience, 1434 Will\n\n\nThe Commander Beetle is an optional boss -- though hard to miss as you explore the Temple of Yellow Flowers. From the Forest of Ferocity Shrine, you need only make your way along the main path and up the stairs to find a large courtyard where the boss trains a group of several Sword Daoists.\n\n## Commander Beetle Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe Commander Beetle would be a fairly straightforward miniboss fight, if not for the six Sword Daoists he's currently training in the large courtyard where you'll find him just past the Forest of Ferocity. Unfortunately, these enemies will respawn until you defeat the Commander, so you won't be able to get him alone so easily.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Knowing that the Daoists don't have a whole lot of heath, there are two things you have on your side: large area-of-effect Spirit Attacks, and your Pluck of Many Spell. The Pluck of Many is a great bet for disorienting the group as you attack, though results can vary, and you'll likely have to jump in an finish off a few Daoists yourself. One is even likely to drop the **Fruit of Dao Soak** for your Gourd!\n\nThis can get tricky, as the Commander Beetle won't just wait around patiently while you defeat his students. He can employ huge strikes that cleave the very ground in a line where he strikes, and if you aren't paying attention, you can usually get hit by the tremors before you know what's going on.\n\nTry to keep in view as much as possible while defeating the Daoists so you can prepare to dodge away from his moves.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
