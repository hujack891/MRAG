These Meditation Spots not only provide a beautiful place to relax and enjoy the scenery but also supply you with one free Skill Point.\n\nSome of these Meditation Spots are very well hidden. Thankfully, though, we have directions to each and every Meditation Spot in the game so you can collect all those free Skill Points.\n\nClick the links below to head straight to a particular location!\n\n| Black Myth Wukong Meditation Spots                           | Black Myth Wukong Meditation Spots                           | Black Myth Wukong Meditation Spots                           |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Black Wind Mountain | Yellow Wind Ridge | The New West |\n| The Webbed Hollow | Flaming Mountains |                                                              |\n\n\nTake the path on the left in the cave after defeating the Whiteclad Noble to find the last Meditation Spot in Chapter 1. The spot is right on the edge of the wooden platform looking out over the forest.\n\n\nThe Sandgate Bound Meditation Spot is in the secret area in Chapter 2. After defeating Fuban, explore the buildings around the perimeter of the desert area to find the last Meditation Spot. The Meditation Spot is on top of a rock on the leftmost side of the area.\n\n## The New West Meditation Spots (Chapter 3)\n\nThere are five Meditation Spots to find in Chapter 3. The New West is a huge, open expanse that can be difficult to navigate, so follow these instructions to find any Meditation Spots you may have missed.\n\n\nThe Mirrormere Meditation Spot is almost directly in front of the Mirrormere Keeper's Shrine. The spot looks out over the edge of the lake underneath a large overhanging tree.\n\n\nThis Meditation Spot is somewhat hidden and only accessible after you've completed the Pagoda Realm. Once you've completed the Pagoda and defeated Captain Wise-Voice, follow the path out of the area until you reach a Celestial Taiyi Pill in a chest. Smash the fence behind it and head into a large, open area containing the Meditation Spot.\n\n\nHead through the path to the right of the Precept Corridor Keeper's Shrine and follow the left wall to find the Meditation Spot. The Statue in question is an inconspicuous Buddha Statue that can be easily overlooked.\n\n\nThe Mindfulness Cliff Track leads you through several small cave entrances, some of which are more like cracks in the wall. Follow these small entrances until you reach a large arena with a Spirit called Non-White in it. Defeat Non-White and absorb his spirit before unlocking the Meditation Spot.\n\nThe Meditation Spot is facing a golden mural painted on the wall.\n\n### The Hall, New Thunderclap Temple Mediation Spot\"\n            - Following Text: \"There are two Temple structures on either side of the New Thunderclap Temple.
