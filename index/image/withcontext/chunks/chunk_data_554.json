He’ll pause for a moment, and then toss his twinblade at you like a boomerang that requires dodging as it spins toward you, and back to his hand.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He can also prepare a flourish before holding his weapon straight up at his side while in a small crouch. If you notice this new stance, be ready to dodge the instant he moves, as he’ll dash forward at an alarming speed, and then dash back to his original spot to try and catch you off-guard.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
