Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Ashen Pass III**\n- Boss Fight - Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n* **Cooling Slope**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n- Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\n* **Fallen Furnace Crater**\n- Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n- Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\n\nAfter defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the Yin-Yang Fish, and the Crimson-Silver Cart, you'll have climbed to the top of the Flaming Mountains and be closer to finding out where the Bull King is.\n\n\nThe gauntlet is almost over! As you continue on, there's a small gap on the left you can dart into and then it's onward toward the flames. When you approach, a cutscene will begin where you'll see the golden spiked ball go flying off the end of the cliff.\n\nAfter the cutscene, ignore Pingping running off, and turn back to where you came from. Remember the wall of flames? Head back there. Now that the ball is gone, it's safe to explore the area slowly and you'll find the flames have also disappeared. A path has been revealed, which is the Cooling Slope, and the next place we'll explore.\n\n\nCollect the green Wisps from the far edge on the left, then follow the path where the fox went toward the Bull King. This will take you down a path that leads up to the Bull King, and where you can find the next Keeper's Shrine called Fallen Furnace Crater.\n\n## Fallen Furnace Crater\n\nHead up the slope to see Pingping speak to her father. The Bull King isn't best pleased with The Destined One, but also has an issue with Pingping and her deception. It turns out that Pingping is actually the Red Boy, and he will transform before your eyes, ready for a battle.\n\n### Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n\nWhen he does stand still -- or he's pausing from his own combos -- you won't be able to finish a combo of your own. It's best to just get a few hits in, then immediately jump back. This is because he'll breathe fire in a small arc directly in front of him as soon as you've hit him a few times.\n\nAs you'd expect from the final boss of The Flaming Mountains, the Red Boy uses a weapon imbued with fire and projectile fire attacks. For this reason, we'd recommend you stock up on Body-Cooling Powder and equip your Fireproof Mantle to help you should you start to take too much elemental damage.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When he winds his staff to create a ring of fire, the attack looks a lot worse than it actually is. He'll throw out the ring toward you and it will start to bounce around the clearing. Keep track of it by looking up and following it to stay away from where it lands. If you keep moving, it's fairly easy to avoid. After bouncing around a few times, the Red Boy will slam down into the ground to recover the spear. There's a brief pause here while he composes himself, so you'll be able to rush in to attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
