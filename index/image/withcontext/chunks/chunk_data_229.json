You’ll also meet the owner of the voice on the wind - the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain.\n\nThis friendly guy will be your guide and mentor for this part of the world, and will bid you to set out in search of Guanyin Temple, which burned down long ago but has since been rebuilt - but not by human hands. As the Keeper departs, he’ll bestow you with the Incense Trail Talisman, which can let you warp back to the last Shrine you rested at.\n\n## Front Hills\n\nHe’ll give a lot more experience and Will when defeated, and you can also loot a **Purple Lingzhi** on the left. On the right you can spot green wisps that denote wandering yaoguai spirits, but trying to gather them will only cause the wisps to fly off, giving you a fraction of their Will.\n\nHead back to the forest hill road, and this time make your way right to encounter your first mini-boss, a Yaoguai Chief.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Bullguard\n\nOnce the Bullguard breaks free and the Keeper vanishes, it will be up to you to finish the fight. Utilize your new Immobilize Spell to bind him when it suits you best — either to ward off an incoming attack, catch your breath so you can heal, or use the moment to hit him from the side, and launch a heavy attack to send him sprawling.\n\nDon’t get too reckless, as the Immobilize Spell has a moderate cooldown, and uses a bit of your magic meter each time. Unlike your health or stamina, you can’t regenerate magic except by resting at a Shrine.\n\nWhen the beast finally falls, you’ll likely get a ton of experience, which you can invest in more skill trees that include a new one for your spells like Immobilize. The path forward is now clear to tread, but it’s still a little ways to the next Shrine. If you’re low on health, you can always head back to the Shrine and rest, as enemies like the Bullguard won’t respawn.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Past the wooden gate the Bullguard was blocking, you’ll find another forested area with a sloping path up to the left. If you want to explore a bit first, head to the right to find a Wolf and some **Purple Lingzhi** , and a small pool of water where two Croaky enemies wait alongside some **Jade Lotus**.\n\nTaking the path up to the left, be ready to deal with a few more Wolf Scouts and Swordsworns. Grab the **Aged Ginseng** by a stone pillar as the path curves right.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces the player to the mechanics of Shrines as checkpoints, where they can rest, heal, and warp back using the Incense Trail Talisman. It sets the narrative context for the area, describing the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain as a guide and mentor, and hints at the next objective: finding Guanyin Temple. The player is then directed to the forest hill road to face their first mini-boss, the Yaoguai Chief, Bullguard, with strategic advice on using the Immobilize Spell during the fight.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a forested area with a path splitting into two directions, marked by red arrows. The player character is shown wielding a staff, suggesting active exploration or combat readiness. The environment features dense trees, rocky terrain, and faintly visible structures, indicating a transitional zone after the Bullguard mini-boss fight. The visual cues, such as the arrows, guide the player toward potential paths for progression or exploration.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text describes the area beyond the wooden gate blocked by the Bullguard. It details two exploration options: heading right to find a Wolf, Purple Lingzhi, a water pool with Croaky enemies, and Jade Lotus, or taking the left path up a slope to encounter Wolf Scouts, Swordsworns, and an Aged Ginseng near a stone pillar. This elaborates on the next steps and rewards for exploration after the mini-boss fight.",
