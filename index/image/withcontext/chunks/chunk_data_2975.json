Hiding across several rope bridges outside the middle of the Webbed Hollow, this boss can't be activated until you obtain a Key Item in the previous chapter. Yellow Loong is the final of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n\n* Rewards: Golden Lining Transformation Spell, Sea-Supporting Tendon, Golden Carp Curio, Kun Steel, Loong Pearl, Mind Core, 6998 Experience, 5049 Will\n\n\nYou can enter the crack in the wall, and on the other side you’ll find a chest containing the Loong Scales. With this item, you’ll be able to unlock the boss.\n\n## Yellow Loong Boss Fight and Guide\n\nSpeaking of which, his other quick melee move will begin with a quick stab from the opposite end of his weapon (while turning his back to you) followed by an electric overhead slam. Don't get greedy, because he'll quickly pull his weapon out to swing it around for a big spinning arc that also extends a huge electric wave, which will shortly detonate with a bigger orange blast that you need to be well away from.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Be **very** wary if you see him whip his weapon around to stab you with the opposite tip without turning his body like the aforementioned attack. If he's able to stab you, it will become an unblockable grab that will almost always give you the Shocked Status, and deplete a huge amount of your health in the process!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
