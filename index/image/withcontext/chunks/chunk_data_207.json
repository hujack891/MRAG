They tend to attack fairly slowly and draw out their sword slices giving you ample time to dodge even while using light combo attacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Since the Destined One can dodge mid-attack, you should press your offense while dealing with these foes, and watch their movements to find the right time to leap out of the way. Your light combo attack comes in four sustained attacks, culminating in a strong overhead slam when performed uninterrupted.\n\nDefeating each of them will earn you a fair bit of Experience - seen by the yellow bar in the top right corner, as well as a bit of “**Will** ”, which serves as a form of currency. Given that you’ll need both to succeed in your adventure, it’s usually best to take on enemies you encounter rather than running past them.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
