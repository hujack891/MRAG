The leader of the Temple of Yellow Flowers and master of the Spider Guai, he is the final boss of the larger Webbed Hollow region.\n\n* Rewards: Golden Glowing Eye, Sky-Piercing Horn, Celestial Ribbon, Fine Gold Thread, Gold Tree Core, Kun Steel, Mind Core, 5329 Experience, 3693 Will\n\n\nThe Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master is a main Yaoguai King, and the final boss you'll encounter in Chapter 4. You'll find him by following the blood trail of the Crimson Spider through the Temple of Yellow Flowers.\n\nOnce you reach the Court of Illumination, you'll find a pathway to the right that leads to a large field where the final boss is located.\n\n## Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master Boss Fight and Guide\n\nIf you see him perform an extravagant twisting somersault through the air, don't be dazzled, as he'll chain this feinting maneuver into a quick grab once he touches back on the ground and take a few step, lunging extra distance to try and yank you forward and take off a huge portion of your health with his crazy unblockable grab attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"This is a good time to use your best Transformation Spell to help whittle down his health, especially if you're worried about the grab or are electrified and need to retreat. The Golden Lining transformation is a good bet for its shock resistance, and many of his massive attacks are slow enough that you can \"see through\" them to build up focus points and blast him back. If you haven't beaten Yellow Loong or aren't sure about his moves, you can also use Hoarfrost or Umbral Abyss to try freezing him, just be sure to keep on top of dodging his big blasts.\n\nThe last piece of his health bar is by far the scariest to take down, and you'll need to constantly be watching his electrified talismans to anticipate where his next big blast is coming from. If you have extra mana, you can also try going for the Pluck of Mana, or just focus on more Immobilizations and Rock Solid Deflections.\n\nOnce you've finally defeated the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, you'll be treated to the finale of the Spider Sisters and their mother. Note that you'll now gain all the Yaoguai Chief entries for the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Sister (despite you not having actually fought against them).\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
