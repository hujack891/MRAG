Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration.\n\n\nOpen the giant door at the top of the stairs. Go straight ahead and activate the Rakshasa Palace Keeper's Shrine.\n\n\nInside here, you'll find the old man who gave you the gourd at the start of the game and an Awaken Wine Worm to the left.\n\nSpeak to the old man, and he'll tell you to find yourself a decent gourd (if you haven't already upgraded yours fully) and you can share a drink with him.\n\n\n## The Emerald Hall\n\nFrom The Emerald Hall Keeper's Shrine, go left and up the stairs. A cutscene will start to play, where you'll transform into a Cicada and fly toward the center of the hall. This is where you'll find Pingping speaking to her mother, Rakshasi, accompanied by the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains.\n\nAfter they discuss The Destined One obtaining the relics, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains offers to care for Rakshashi, which Pingping protests. After he binds Pingping, Rakshashi is revealed to be Zhu Bajie transformed and it's time to take on the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains for yourself.\n\n### Yaoguai King - Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and Yin-Yang Fish\n\nThe Keeper of the Flaming Mountains will transport you to another place, in a monochrome illusion where he uses the power of yin-yang. Zhu Bajie will be there to help you at first, so focus on attacking the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains as quickly as you can. This is a two-phase fight, and as you might expect, the second phase is where the action really begins.\n\nIn the first phase, try to hold off on using your spells as much as you can. Instead, try to be aggressive and relentlessly attack the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains while he's on the ground.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He will start to attack using white projectiles, which can be dodged or outrun. When you've got his health down to around 60-70%, he will use the white and black orbs to summon undead enemies.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
