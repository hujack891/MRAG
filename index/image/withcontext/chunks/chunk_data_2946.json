Located in the middle section of The Webbed Hollow, this creepy long hand is more than it seems, and blocks the passage down to the Lower Hollow.\n\n* Rewards: Buddha's Right Hand (Key Item), Past-Echo, Fine Gold Thread, Cold Iron Leaves, 2274 Experience, 1933 Will\n\n\nThe Buddha's Right Hand is an main boss and non-missable encounter that you'll find exploring the massive Webbed Hollow Portion of Chapter 4. After descending down to the Vedure Bridge Shrine and defeating the Centipede Guai in the Bonevault, follow the linear path up to the Cliff of Oblivion.\n\nJust past the Shrine, you'll find a narrow passageway with a creepy hand holding a mirror, but this is actually the boss fight you seek!\n\n## Buddha's Right Hand Boss Fight and Guide\n\nWhen you try to interact with the strange mirror, it will disappear as the hand attached to a very long disturbing arm decides to attack you. This fight is a fairly unorthodox one, and you'll need to expect the unexpected as you face this foe in a very narrow hallway with limited room to dodge.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The strange hand has a few different moves it can use both up close and at range you'll need to become familiar with. One of its opening moves will be to slap the wall near you, but that's not all -- the move will cause several rocks to fall from above, and with your limited visibility you'll need to keep dodging around 3-4 large rocks with the last one often being delayed.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
