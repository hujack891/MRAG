The fifth of the frogs, Baw-Lang-Lang can only be discovered once you've taken down the Five Element Carts and gained access to Bishui Cave.\n\n\nAs you head inside the cave, go down the slope. You'll see a large structure in the center of the room that's being hit by the light. This is what will teleport you to Bishui Cave, but first, you'll want to look to the left. Here you can find the fifth of the frog bosses in the game, called Baw-Lang-Lang.\n\n## Baw-Lang-Lang Boss Fight and Guide\n\nMuch like other bosses in this Chapter, Baw-Lang-Lang favors fire attacks. And much like the other frog bosses, you'll see the same set of moves from Baw-Lang-Lang that include the tongue whip and leaping.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When Baw-Lang-Lang whips its tongue, it will be coated in fire. The frog will whip it left to right, or shoot it straight out at you. You can jump over its tongue or dodge the attacks.\n\nYou'll then find it uses a leaping attack, where it swipes at you twice and then leaps up and over to you, to try and catch you. When it lands, a little burst of fire will emerge from underneath it.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
