Located in the Kingdom of Sahali locked away in the past, you'll need to help fulfill a drunken Boar's quest to access this area.\n\n* **Rewards:** Wind Tamer, Sky-Piercing Horn\n\n\nOnce you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into the Kingdom of Sahali.\n\nAfter besting the \"Tiger Vanguard\", you'll find none other than the Yellow Rat Sage, who needs your help defeating a giant scarab Guai in the sands below.\n\n## Fuban Boss Fight and Guide\n\nBy dealing enough damage, the Yellow Wind Sage can also knock Fuban to the ground. Be wary when approaching at first, if you see Fuban start to thrash left and right, it’s better to hang back, and wait until the rat can follow up with another powerful attack to stun Fuban until he lies on his side.\"\n            - Following Text: \"That’s your cue to rush in and hit Fuban’s exposed area with your biggest hits, using charged strikes, Spirit Attacks, and Transformation Spells to unload on the beetle before he can rise up.\n\nWhen following this strategy, you’ll quickly burn through the rest of Fuban’s health bar, and between you and the Yellow Wind Sage, the beetle will stand little chance. He can still repeatedly slam his head in the ground to create shockwaves, and finally pull up with a massive explosion. Again, the Pillar Stance can be useful for dodging these blasts, so long as you have a bit of distance away from him too.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
