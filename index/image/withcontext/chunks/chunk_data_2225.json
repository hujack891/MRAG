Though it is a short area, it will prove to be a challenging one as you go up against the greedy King of the Mountain. Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the cave to the mountaintop, as well as how to defeat the boss of this area in his two forms, the Black Wind King and the Black Bear Guai.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Cave Interior**\n- Black Wind King\n* **Outside the Cave**\n* **Bodhi Peak**\n- Black Bear Guai\n\n\nReturn to the path and take the stairs up to fight against another Wolf Assassin as the cave grows dark, and draw them into the light if needed.\n\nAs you reach an open part of the cave, you’ll have to face one more assassin along the darkened path, and you may notice they’ll go out of their way to destroy the torches along the path to further envelop them in darkness. If you have trouble facing them, always try to bring them to a brighter spot.\n\nNote that if you went ahead and defeated the Secret Boss by ringing the three bells, you should also have access to craft an additional Bronze Set that improves your abilities using the Immobilize Spell!\n\nCraft and upgrade whatever you can afford at the moment, because a boss is waiting inside the temple to test your might, and he’s no pushover.\n\n\nCheck the sides of the cave to find some Jade Lotus and Aged Ginseng, then head to the far end to sidle through an exit. This disguised loading screen will turn the day into dusk as you find yourself closer to the top of the mountain.\n\n## Outside the Cave\n\nAfter resting at the nearby Shrine, you can look for a small cliffside path below the shrine for a Snake-Head Mushroom, and then start your ascent to the top of the mountain.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Just ahead up the path, a Wolf Sentinel and two Wolf Archers will be ready to engage you, so lure the Sentinel back down the path first, and then deflect the arrows as you reach the two archers and deal with them. Just below their position, you can find a lower path with a green wisp Spirit to absorb for some Will.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.
