Below, you'll find a Walkthrough for the first major area of The Flaming Mountains called Woods of Ember, as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* ** **Ashen Pass I\n- Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Brown-Iron Cart\n* **Camp of Seasons**\n* **Height of Ember**\n- Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones\n- Yoaguai Chief - Gray-Bronze Cart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind\n* **Ashen Pass II**\n\n##  Ashen Pass I\n\nBefore you go over to them, harvest the **Fire Bellflower** by the Buddha statue on the right. Then, go straight up and into the midst of the fighting, to find the Pale-Axe Stalwart taking on nearby Revenants. Alongside the fighting, the area is also being pelted with firebombs so having the Fireproof Mantle Vessel here can help you focus more on the fighting and less on the fire attacks.\n\n### Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\n\nOnce you've collected everything, head up the next set of stairs. At the top of these steps, the health bar for the Brown-Iron Cart will appear and you can find it blocking the path to the left. However, there's also a broken set of stairs to the immediate right, which you can climb up. This will bring you to a small roof you can run along to collect a green Wisp.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Dash up the broken steps and run along the small path to get behind the cart. Drop down and you'll also be at the next Keeper's Shrine.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.
