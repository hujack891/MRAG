The Wight is much tougher than any other bosses you can fight this early in the game, and while it is still possible to defeat them early, it is highly recommended that you level up further before taking them on.\n\n* Rewards: Wandering Wight Spirit, Cat’s Eye Beads, Stone Spirit, 691 Will, 1,049 Experience\n\n\nYou can find him in the Forest of Wolves area by proceeding straight from the Outside the Forest Shrine, and past an axe-wielding Wolf Guai across a small bridge to a large clearing where the hulking giant patrols back and forth. Due to his staggering size, he’s hard to miss!\n\n## Wandering Wight Boss Fight and Guide\n\nHowever, the nastiest attack in the Wandering Wight’s disposal is easily his earthquake causing slam attack. If you see him wave his hands before holding one up in the air, be ready to dodge or start running away fast, as he’ll slam his fist into the ground and cause an explosion around him.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Most times, he’ll keep his hand in the ground and begin to pulse two more explosions that increase in range, followed by one final blast that’s delayed to lure you in, so be sure to take a breather and heal during this part if needed. While it’s sometimes possible to use the Pillar Stance to rise above the quakes if you are able to unlock the tree, it doesn’t always work, and isn’t recommended.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
