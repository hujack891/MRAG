As you near it, you can also spot a dragon man standing alone in the shallows. Zhu Bajie seems to know him, but as you approach, you'll be pulled into another boss fight.\n\n\nAs you head close to inspect the skull of the great snake, a Yaoguai Chief will fly down to intercept you: a much bigger version of the bats you've faced recently!\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Apramana Bat\n\nBeware of another tentacle abomination monk waiting for you as you drop down, and then head through the tunnel passage as it begins to narrow.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once you reach a fork in the tunnel, take the left exit to head outside, where you'll find a **Treasure Chest** on the right by a large mural, and several Frozen Corpses on a wooden platform to the left.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
