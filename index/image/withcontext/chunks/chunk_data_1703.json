An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n\nNow it’s time to finally open that door the Rat Captains were guarding. In the next scene, you’ll spot the next major boss fight: a tiny Rat King and his oversized son.\n\n\nAnother terrifying new move is for him to do a slow spin ending with a weapon toss right at you. He’ll quickly follow up with a leaping dive attack to reach his mace, and then pull it out of the ground and swing it forth, which should quell any thoughts of trying to attack at this point.\n\nIdeally, the lower you have his health before killing his father, the less time you’ll have to worry about this phase if you can rush him down. If you don’t kill his dad, he’ll scurry off as soon as the Second Prince falls. If not, you’ll be able to help yourself to the Second Prince’s Spirit, as well as a Pungent Flesh Chunk.\n\n## Valley of Despair\n\nFor this walkthrough, we’ll wrap up the last sub-region of Sandgate before diverting to Fright Valley first, and then the Crouching Tiger Temple, but you’re free to explore where you want.\"\n            - Following Text: \"You’ll find a new Shrine to rest at, not far to the left of the sealed door. Just beyond the Shrine is a cave entrance, guarded by a Rat Soldier and Rat Archer supporting him on some scaffolding. Skirt around the soldier to engage the archer first.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.
