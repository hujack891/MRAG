An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n## Village Entrance\n\nThe Xu Dog as he’s known has a problem he needs help with: A large frog has swallowed one of his medicinal formulas, and you’re just the person he’s looking for to get it back.\n\n\nHeading to the left of the lone shack, you’ll find a gate guarded by a Rat Governor and another Archer on the rooftops that connects to the one you climbed earlier. Defeat them to gain access to a large open field inside the Village’s main area. From across the field, a voice pleading to be freed calls out, but in your way is a large loping creature that will want to engage you first.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Earth Wolf\n\nSince they’re all gone, head through the gate the archers were guarding and stick to the right side to find a path up to a chest, which you can loot to get 1 **Small Piece of Gold** and 3 **Tiny Piece of Gold**.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Now it’s time to finally open that door the Rat Captains were guarding.
