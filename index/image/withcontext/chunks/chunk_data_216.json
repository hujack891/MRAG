You’ll also meet the owner of the voice on the wind - the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain.\n\nThis friendly guy will be your guide and mentor for this part of the world, and will bid you to set out in search of Guanyin Temple, which burned down long ago but has since been rebuilt - but not by human hands. As the Keeper departs, he’ll bestow you with the Incense Trail Talisman, which can let you warp back to the last Shrine you rested at.\n\n## Front Hills\n\nCrossing the bridge will lead to a much more open section of this region. While Black Myth: Wukong is a fairly linear adventure, you will find that areas sometimes open up to allow for a bit more exploration off the beaten path, which can be essential for finding unique items and optional boss encounters.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Defeat the next shield bearing Wolf Soldier down the road, and then another Wolf Stalwart guarding a **Purple Lingzhi** Mushroom you can harvest at the foot of a large tree.
