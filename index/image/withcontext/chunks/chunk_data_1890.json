Combat in Black Myth: Wukong can be quite the challenge, so picking up all of the Awaken Wine Worms to get the most out of your healing is essential.\n\nAwaken Wine Worms can be rather difficult to find but are always contained in pots with a golden glow spilling out from underneath the lid. Here, we have the locations of all Awaken Wine Worms so you can collect any you may have missed along your travels.\n\nYou can use your Awaken Wine Worms at the Monkey's cave in the Marsh of the White Mist.\n\n* Black Wind Cave Awaken Wine Worm\n* Marsh of the White Mist Awaken Wine Worms\n* Yellow Wind Ridge Awaken Wine Worm\n* Outside the Pagoda Awaken Wine Worm\n* Longevity Road Awaken Wine Worm\n* The Estate of the Zhu Awaken Wine Worm\n* Temple of the Yellow Flowers Awaken Wine Worm\n* Purple Cloud Mountain Awaken Wine Worm\n* Rakshasa Palace Awaken Wine Worm\n* Bishui Cave Awaken Wine Worm\n\n\nThe Awaken Wine Worm in Chapter 1 is hidden in a temple guarded by the Black Wind King. After defeating the boss, head to the left side of the temple and break the pots to uncover your first Awaken Wine Worm.\n\n\nOnce you reach Chapter 3, you can revisit the Monkey at his cave in the Marsh of the White Mist and purchase more Awaken Wine Worms from him.\n\n\nHead through the gate beside the Longevity Road Keeper's Shrine and into the stone-paved clearing. Turn left and follow the path downhill and to the right, where you will encounter the Turtle Treasure Yaoguai. Defeat it and break the barrel it was guarding to collect the next Awaken Wine Worm.\n\n## The Estate of the Zhu Awaken Wine Worm\"\n            - Following Text: \"Upon starting Chapter 4, you will find yourself in a small town called the Estate of the Zhu, where you will fight the Second Sister.
