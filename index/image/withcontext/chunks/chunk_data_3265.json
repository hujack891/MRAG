Below you'll find a guide to accessing the kingdom of the past by undertaking the Drunk Boar's Questline to find a Sobering Stone, and how to defeat the Tiger Vanguard and secret Yaoguai King Boss, Fuban.\n\n* Jump to a Section:\n* **How to Access the Kingdom of Sahali**\n- Yaoguai Chief - \"Tiger Vanguard\"\n* **Sandgate Bound**\n- Yaoguai King - Fuban\n\nThis Chapter 2 Secret can only be accessed by meeting the Yellow-Robed Square in Fright Cliff (aka the Drunken Boar), and helping him in his search for the \"Realm of Gold\" which requires a few steps (and for you to best him in combat).\n\n\nOnce you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into the Kingdom of Sahali\n\n\nAs you round the corner, you’ll be told to halt by the defender of a large gate: A slightly familiar looking Tiger Guai who calls himself the Vanguard of the Yellow Wind King. If he looks familiar to another Vanguard you’ve faced, that’s because he’s actually the other Vanguard’s father! He’ll ask that you turn around and head home, which seems like such a waste with all you’ve gone through just to get here.\n\n\nUpon defeat, you’ll gain the **Tiger Tally** curio, and he’ll realize your prowess and invite you to meet his king.\n\n\nThe yellow-furred rat is at an impasse, as the scarab’s magic is preventing him from engaging the monster directly. This is where you come on. The Yellow Rat Sage will agree to pound the drums to force the scarab to the surface, allowing you to engage the behemoth directly and find whatever vessel is giving it its power.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Fuban\n\nWhen he’s finally out of health, the battle will be won, and the Yellow Wind Sage will valiantly land the final blow. It’s a shame we’ll have to beat him up in the future. For your part in the battle, you’ll earn a Sky-Piercing Horn weapon material, and a new Vessel: The Wind Tamer!\"\n            - Following Text: \"Just as the Vessel from Chapter 1 proved a huge advantage against the Black Bear King, so too will the Wind Tamer be instrumental in negating the sandstorm attacks of the Yellow Wind Sage boss at the end of Chapter 2. Even outside of that fight, you can utilize it to grant additional damage negation, making it a great addition to your gear.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
