As an optional foe, you can seek out this boss in the Yellow Wind Formation through one of three possible entrances to where the Chapter Boss resides behind sealed stone gates.\n\n* Rewards: Gore-Eye Daoist Spirit\n\n## Where to Find the Gore-Eye Daoist\n\nHowever, in order to open the door, you will need both the Sterness of Stone from the Stone Vanguard Boss, and Keeness of Tiger from the Tiger Vanguard Boss. With both Key Items, you'll be able to interact with the Tally in front of the door and open it, and you'll find the boss after crossing a bridge down to the Windseal Gate.\n\n### Gore-Eye Daoist Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nOne of these blood spells is to basically turn his staff into a firehose, and he’ll spray blood in a frontal arc around him to force you to back off, creating several new pools at his feet. Depending on your positioning, you can either try to dodge behind him, or take a retreating jump and follow up with the thrust stance heavy attack outside of his range.\n\nHe’ll have a few more variations of expelling blood from his staff - either in a concentrated stream straight ahead, or flinging his staff to create a wave of it in front of you, so be ready for waves of blood to fly out whenever he charges up.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If you see him begin to lean back and shake his staff over his head, prepare for him to create several more blood projectiles to shoot out of the eyes on his back. They’ll track your position and fly in an arc towards you, so be ready to dodge or employ your staff spin to destroy the projectiles before they can poison you.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
