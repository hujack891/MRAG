The best way to deal with these is to dodge them or try to hang back from the beast as far as you can.\"\n            - Following Text: \"It will sometimes roll over when it tries to punch you and misses, allowing you to perform a quick follow-up attack. Where it differs from the other bosses, is that it will also leap up in the air and land like a frog, creating an explosion around it each time it lands.
