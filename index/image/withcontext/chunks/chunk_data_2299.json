Below you'll find a guide for the Valley of Ecstasy Region, including how to reach the valley itself by defeating Non-White, and exploring the different parts of the valley to uncover several Yaoguai Chiefs on the path to the New Thunderclap Temple, and completing the Treasure Hunter's Quest and the Pagoda Realm Prisoner's Quest by defeating the final Captain.\n\n- **Jump to a Section:**\n- **Mindfulness Cliff**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White (Round Two)\n- **Forest of Felicity**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- **Brook of Bliss**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Able\n- **Towers of Karma**\n- Yauoguai Chief - Old Ginseng Guai\n- **Longevity Road**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Captain Kalpa-Wave\n\nAfter you solved the monk's riddle by praying at four Buddha Statues in the Precept Corridor, you'll split up from Zhu Bajie and make your way into the belly button of a large Buddha statue along the cliffs, taking you up a narrow pathway and into the Mindfulness Cliff.\n\n\nFrom the Shrine, you'll find yourself at the edge of a large pit with a pathway spiraling around its edge.\n\nHowever, as you begin to head up the path around the pit, you'll be interrupted by the arrival of a jester-like figure who wants to wear your face.\n\n\nContinue taking the path back outside and up the cliffs to reach a large open area with an archway at the far end leading to a huge valley, and on the right you'll find Non-White at a Meditation Spot waiting for round two.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-White (Round Two)\n\nWith so many feinting attacks and vanishing, it can be hard to get a bead on him, and unfortunately, he tends to escape from Immobilization almost instantly, so you'll need to save that for when his frozen sword regenerates, and instead focus on deflecting his wild strikes to stop him in his tracks. Since many of his attacks are low to the ground, it's not a bad idea to swap to the Pillar Stance during this phase to attack him from above, rather than continuing to rely on the Smash Stance to see through his attacks if he'll just feint away.\n\nThere's a good chance he'll revert back to his original weapon before the fight is done, so make sure to adapt your tactics accordingly, and use a Transformation Spell like Red Tides to keep up with his movements.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When Non-White finally falls, you'll be able to claim the Non-White Spirit from him, and also make use of the **Meditation Spot** nearby to claim a free Skill Point.\n\n**Warning** \\- Before you proceed, make sure you've defeated the Apramana Bat along the North Shore of the Bitter Lake, and also encountered the Treasure Hunter man before you proceed into the next area!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
