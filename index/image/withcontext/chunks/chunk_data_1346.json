This Yaoguai Chief is sent to block your progress into the Valley of Ecstasy, but you'll need to fight him twice to defeat this foe.\n\n* **Rewards:** Non-White Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Cold Iron Leaves x2, Random Materials, 1847 Experience, 1188 Will\n\n\nIf you've got a good idea of his attack patterns, using the Smash Stance's varied combo to \"see through\" his attacks can be extremely useful to power through his slices to hit him while he's unable to defend, and the follow-up heavystrike you can unlock usually can't be blocked by him either.\n\nThe good news is once you've taken out half of his real health bar (not his sword's defense bar), he'll break off the attack and retreat. The bad news is you haven't seen the last of him.\n\nContinue taking the path up the cliffs to reach a large open area with an archway at the far end leading to a huge valley, and on the right you'll find Non-White at a Meditation Spot waiting for round two.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-White (Round Two)\n\nAnother dangerous attack that can be hard to follow will start with him moving erratically in his mist form to close the distance to you, and start with a spinning slash attack. As the momentum carries him in a circle, he'll return to face you by spewing poison in your face. Since it's a ranged attack you won't be able to deflect this one, but you can dodge to the side while sprays straight ahead.\n\nWhen he crouches down while crossing his blades, he'll leap over for a low jump attack with both daggers, followed by two delayed swings of his poisoned weapons, and ending with a quick uppercut attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"One last move he can perform quickly when at a distance is using his vanishing act to slide along the ground and then feint up in the air to the side of you before slashing down at an angle. He'll do this twice in a row to keep your guessing at his movements, ending with a slam attack that will break the ground around him even if he misses you.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
