The cursed and undead remains of a celestial rooster guai, you can find this monster at the peak of the Purple Cloud Mountain, a secret area of the Webbed Hollow.\n\n* Rewards: Weaver's Needle Vessel, Duskveil's Horn, Kun Steel, Double-Combed Rooster Blood, Gold Tree Core, Mind Core, 3410 Experience, 2595 Will\n\n\nThe Duskveil is an optional Yaoguai King, though required to complete the region and return to the Temple of Yellow Flowers. It is highly recommended that you defeat both The Scorpionlord and Daoist Mi before taking on The Duskveil, as defeating it may cause them to disappear.\n\nTo reach Purple Cloud Mountain, you will have to defeat the Venom Daoist twice - both in the Upper Webbed Hollow, and in a side path outside the Temple of Yellow Flowers main area. This will unlock a mural allowing you to travel to this new area.\n\nOnce you reach the first main shrine at the Valley of Blooms, stick to the left side to find a path up to the Petalfall Village, and continue along either path up to reach the peak, where the main boss lies.\n\n## The Duskveil Boss Fight and Guide\n\nIf it raises its right hoof, be prepared for a quick slam, after which it can either flap away quickly to retreat from any counters you might have in mind, or it will rear back its head and -- after a short delay -- slam it into the ground. The latter will give you more time to retaliate, and both of these moves can be deflected.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The Duskveil can also raise its hoof up while pivoting slightly, in which case it will perform a swift kick instead that drags along the ground. It will follow with two slow sweeps of its arms in both directions that need only be dodged once each, or you can use Rock Solid to knock it back.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
