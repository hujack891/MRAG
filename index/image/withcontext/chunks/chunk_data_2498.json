The Wight is much tougher than any other bosses you can fight this early in the game, and while it is still possible to defeat them early, it is highly recommended that you level up further before taking them on.\n\n* Rewards: Wandering Wight Spirit, Cat’s Eye Beads, Stone Spirit, 691 Will, 1,049 Experience\n\n\nYou can find him in the Forest of Wolves area by proceeding straight from the Outside the Forest Shrine, and past an axe-wielding Wolf Guai across a small bridge to a large clearing where the hulking giant patrols back and forth. Due to his staggering size, he’s hard to miss!\n\n## Wandering Wight Boss Fight and Guide\n\nWhat makes the Wandering Wight such a tough opponent isn’t just the massive damage he can deal with a single attack, but the deceptive power and speed some of his attacks can have. Many times the Wight will default to attacking with two lengthy foot stomps, which can be easy to dodge once you get the timing down.\"\n            - Following Text: \"However, he’ll usually follow these stomps with a series of up to three spinning sweep attacks, twirling quickly in a large arc that will damage you unless you dodge at the right time. Since he may or may not follow up one spin with another, you’ll need to be very careful in figuring out when it’s okay to retaliate with an attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
