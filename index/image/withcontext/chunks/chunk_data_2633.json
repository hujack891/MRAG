Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nThe easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step. Cast it near the start of the rope bridge, and then sprint all the way to the other end, and don't try to staff spin if any arrows come your way, or you're likely to walk off the side by accident.\n\n\nRather helpfully, there's a brazier by a ledge nearby, and looking down you can find a spot to drop back down to the two bridges we noted at the start of the Lower Hollow, putting you quickly back on track to the main pathway.\n\n\nBe sure to climb back up the ledges (use a jumping heavy attack to gain height), and continue to follow this path to a flooded cave where this chapter's Frog Boss awaits.\n\n\nPast this foe, you'll enter another long dark tunnel, and you can find a Puppet Spider hanging up on the right above a green Wisp to absorb, and a patrolling Lantern Holder further down the tunnel.\n\n\nOnce you're ready, head through the gate to join the party, and it seems your just in time to meet the not-so-lucky groom.\n\n\nThere actually isn't anything more you can do in the Hut of Immortality, as all the doors are sealed. However, when you return to the Shrine outside, you'll find a new cave path has been carved out that leads outside to a large muddy hole.\n\nYour battle with Zhu Bajie isn't over. In fact -- it's about to get a whole lot harder.\n\n## Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie (Second Encounter)\n\nA few moves will be altered slightly, as instead of tearing up the ground with his rake, he can send muddy projectiles your way instead, which seem to have a more more narrow arc to compensate for your diminished evasion.\n\nHe can also still spin into a tornado (which you should try to sprint away from rather than dodge), and getting hit by it can send you flying. However, he won't get dizzy this time around, so prepare for him to quickly move into his next move rather than standing around for awhile.\"\n            - Following Text: \"One new move (and herald of things to come) will often appear after one of his jumping slash attacks. Once he hits the ground, he'll use his own transformation attack to turn into a giant muddy carp, which will quickly roll forward to try and flatten you, but you can dodge under it with some timing.\n\nFight carefully, and take note of which of his rake attacks swing fast, vs the ones that take time to swing around to dodge at the right times, or have a focus point in reserve to use a Thrust Stance varied combo and get out of his attack range.\n\nOnce you take off half his health bar, things will get real messy fast. Zhu Bajie will go back to his roots, in a sense, and transform into a giant boar that just can't wait to roll around in the mud with you.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
