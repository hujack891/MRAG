Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration.\n\n\nOpen the giant door at the top of the stairs. Go straight ahead and activate the Rakshasa Palace Keeper's Shrine.\n\n\nInside here, you'll find the old man who gave you the gourd at the start of the game and an Awaken Wine Worm to the left.\n\nSpeak to the old man, and he'll tell you to find yourself a decent gourd (if you haven't already upgraded yours fully) and you can share a drink with him.\n\n\n## The Emerald Hall\n\nFrom The Emerald Hall Keeper's Shrine, go left and up the stairs. A cutscene will start to play, where you'll transform into a Cicada and fly toward the center of the hall. This is where you'll find Pingping speaking to her mother, Rakshasi, accompanied by the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains.\n\nAfter they discuss The Destined One obtaining the relics, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains offers to care for Rakshashi, which Pingping protests. After he binds Pingping, Rakshashi is revealed to be Zhu Bajie transformed and it's time to take on the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains for yourself.\n\n\nWhen he's almost dead, he will then summon Ma Tianba for you to fight against.\n\n\nTake the stairs up to the right and follow these up and into the dark cave. Then go right again, and up the next set of stairs to find the Crimson-Silver Cart\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Crimson Silver Cart\n\nContinue up the stairs to the left, and follow the rocky path up to the top of the mountain, where you'll reach the Ashen Pass III Keeper's Shrine and be ready to take on the Field of Fire.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If you haven't already, go back to the Valley Entrance to get the Dark Thunder Transformation Spell from Ma Tianba in the dead cart. You'll know when you arrive if you'll get the spell, as he'll tell you to come closer before his soul departs. This time, the option to Pull Forcefully will appear.
