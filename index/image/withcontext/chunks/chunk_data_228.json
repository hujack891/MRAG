You’ll also meet the owner of the voice on the wind - the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain.\n\nThis friendly guy will be your guide and mentor for this part of the world, and will bid you to set out in search of Guanyin Temple, which burned down long ago but has since been rebuilt - but not by human hands. As the Keeper departs, he’ll bestow you with the Incense Trail Talisman, which can let you warp back to the last Shrine you rested at.\n\n## Front Hills\n\nHe’ll give a lot more experience and Will when defeated, and you can also loot a **Purple Lingzhi** on the left. On the right you can spot green wisps that denote wandering yaoguai spirits, but trying to gather them will only cause the wisps to fly off, giving you a fraction of their Will.\n\nHead back to the forest hill road, and this time make your way right to encounter your first mini-boss, a Yaoguai Chief.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Bullguard\n\nOnce you carve out about half of the Bullguard’s health bar, he’ll parry your next strike and move in for the killing blow — until the Keeper intervenes. Using an immobilization spell to lock him in place, the Keeper will pass on the magic spell to the Destined One, giving you your first spell - **Immobilize**!\n\nImmobilize allows you to bind an enemy in place for a small duration, at which point you’re able to make use of the pause to unload with attacks until the effect breaks. Stronger enemies like this Yaoguai Chief will break out a lot sooner than regular foes, and certain bosses can even resist it entirely, so be wary!\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once the Bullguard breaks free and the Keeper vanishes, it will be up to you to finish the fight. Utilize your new Immobilize Spell to bind him when it suits you best — either to ward off an incoming attack, catch your breath so you can heal, or use the moment to hit him from the side, and launch a heavy attack to send him sprawling.\n\nDon’t get too reckless, as the Immobilize Spell has a moderate cooldown, and uses a bit of your magic meter each time. Unlike your health or stamina, you can’t regenerate magic except by resting at a Shrine.\n\nWhen the beast finally falls, you’ll likely get a ton of experience, which you can invest in more skill trees that include a new one for your spells like Immobilize. The path forward is now clear to tread, but it’s still a little ways to the next Shrine. If you’re low on health, you can always head back to the Shrine and rest, as enemies like the Bullguard won’t respawn.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.

Players are advised to use the spell strategically to either avoid attacks, heal, or land heavy strikes. The spell has a cooldown and consumes magic, which can only be replenished at Shrines. Defeating Bullguard rewards significant experience points, which can be used to unlock new skills, including enhancements for spells like Immobilize.
