Not to be confused with his brother, the Tiger Vanguard of the Crouching Tiger Temple, you can only reach this boss by following the trail of a ghostly boy using the Old Rattle-Drum Key Item.\n\n* Rewards: Mad Tiger Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Yaoguai Core x1, Stone Spirit x1, 1102 Experience, 1023 Will, Plaguebane Gourd (in chest)\n\n\nUsing the Rattle-Drum here one final time will cause the spirit of the boy to appear before you, and invite you to hop down the well to meet a “friend”. Unfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there.\n\n## Mad Tiger Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThere are certain times after performing slam attacks that he may keep his claws deep in the ground. If he continues to crouch down while charging up, it means he’ll rip his fists out to send a shower of rocks erupting in your path.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Other times, he’ll begin to pick up a massive boulder, but instead of tossing it, he’ll leap across the room to personally deliver the massive rock to your face, which can deal a ton of damage.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
