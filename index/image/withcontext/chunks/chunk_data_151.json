Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby.\n\n## Rhino Watch Slope\n\nIn the midst of the trees, there's a small patch of ground with no grass. The Poison Chief can be found here.\n\n\nThankfully, each of the Poison Chief fights is pretty much the same. You can expect the same moveset and should prepare for them in the same way.\n\nWhen the second Poison Chief is down, return to the Rhino Watch Slope and then head into the area with the flames on the ground. A cutscene will play out as you get there, and the Gold Armored Rhino will appear.\n\n\nWhen you get to the edge, look down to see a muddy clearing. Down here, you can find the next optional boss, which is the final frog Lang-Baw-Baw.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Baw-Baw\n\nAfter a certain amount of time, he will solidify, turn brown, and become like stone. If you hit him during this state, your attacks will bounce off of him, though they will do minimal amounts of damage. When he's like this, he will start to use rocks to attack. He can also roar, which will momentarily stun you and damage you at the same time.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Expect to see him using rocks like shockwaves, where he'll punch the ground and disturb the ground underneath you, and also call rocks up into the air. When this happens, he'll roar and send them hurtling toward you. Another variation of a rock attack he performs is that a circle of rocks will spike up from the ground on occasion.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.

The environment is a rocky, barren clearing with sparse vegetation, consistent with the described muddy area. A player character is visible, seemingly preparing to engage the boss. The stone formations likely represent Lang-Baw-Baw's rock-based abilities, aligning with his described mechanics.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text elaborates on Lang-Baw-Baw's rock-based attacks, including shockwaves, airborne rocks, and spiked rock circles. These abilities are triggered by his roar and ground-punching actions, emphasizing the need for players to anticipate and avoid these powerful moves during the fight.",
