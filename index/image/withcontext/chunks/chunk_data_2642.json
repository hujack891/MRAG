Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nThe easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step. Cast it near the start of the rope bridge, and then sprint all the way to the other end, and don't try to staff spin if any arrows come your way, or you're likely to walk off the side by accident.\n\n\nRather helpfully, there's a brazier by a ledge nearby, and looking down you can find a spot to drop back down to the two bridges we noted at the start of the Lower Hollow, putting you quickly back on track to the main pathway.\n\n\nBe sure to climb back up the ledges (use a jumping heavy attack to gain height), and continue to follow this path to a flooded cave where this chapter's Frog Boss awaits.\n\n\nPast this foe, you'll enter another long dark tunnel, and you can find a Puppet Spider hanging up on the right above a green Wisp to absorb, and a patrolling Lantern Holder further down the tunnel.\n\n\nOnce you're ready, head through the gate to join the party, and it seems your just in time to meet the not-so-lucky groom.\n\n\nThere actually isn't anything more you can do in the Hut of Immortality, as all the doors are sealed. However, when you return to the Shrine outside, you'll find a new cave path has been carved out that leads outside to a large muddy hole.\n\nYour battle with Zhu Bajie isn't over. In fact -- it's about to get a whole lot harder.\n\n## Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie (Second Encounter)\n\nOnce he's out of the mud and on the surface, he'll transform again, this time into a large rhino, and begin to charge at you. If this wasn't bad enough, he'll summon two copies to charge just behind him on either side, making dodging extremely risky.\n\nThe only good news is that the copies don't seem to alter their path once they start the charge, but Zhu Bajie will, so you'll need to be careful about timing your dodges and not rolling into a path of a copy. Rock Solid will only move you backward, and won't be too much help if it traps you in front of him.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once he charges for a third time, he'll lose the clones, and then transform back into a fish for a moment. Wait for him to dive through the air past you, and he'll then rocket toward you as a giant glob of mud.\n\nDodge or deflect if you can't move fast enough, and be ready for his boar form to reappear dazed and winded from the phase. This is your big opportunity to hit him with all the focus points you've stored up, as well as any powerful Spirit Attacks you can unleash.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
