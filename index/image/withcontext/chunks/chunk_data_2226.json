The Soak's ability is rather specialised, useful for specific spell builds or when adopting a particular playstyle.\n\nWith the Tiger Relic Soak equipped, using the gourd moderately increases your critical hit chance for a brief duration.\n\nSoaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor.\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Tiger Relic Location\n\nThe Tiger Relic is found on a platform beneath the Crouching Tiger Temple in Yellow Wind Ridge. To get it, you will need the Keeness of Tiger and Sterness of Stone from the Tiger Vanguard and Stone Vanguard in the chapter.\n\nYou can then open the Tally in the arena and head beneath the temple.\"\n            - Following Text: \"At the end of the pathway, you will reach a slope leading down. As you step on the slope, jump to reach the platform above, which has the Soak.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
