Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration.\n\n## Valley Entrance\n\nContinue along the path, where it curves down to the right. Here you'll find another Earth Rakshasa patrolling. Once you've dealt with the fire-breathing Rakshasa, keep going toward the pillar.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Ultimately, you're going to go left to continue on the main path (and you may start to hear characters talk as you approach this pillar), but for now, you'll want to detour and explore the area to the right.\n\nThe first thing you'll see as you go to the right is the Flamlings that sit in the lava. These will spit fire at you, so it's best to deal with them to remove the ranged attacks while you explore.\n\n### A Note on Flamlings\n\nFlamings will drop Flame Ores, which are an important item needed for a secret boss later on in the Chapter, so be sure to tackle each Flamling you find.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.

A character is visible in the foreground, standing on a rocky ledge, while a red arrow points to the right, indicating a suggested direction for exploration. The scene aligns with the walkthrough's description of the Valley Entrance area, where the player is navigating toward a pillar and encountering enemies like Flamlings in the lava.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text advises the player to initially detour to the right instead of continuing left on the main path. This detour leads to an area with Flamlings, which are hostile creatures that spit fire from the lava. Defeating these enemies is recommended, as they drop Flame Ores, a valuable item needed for a secret boss later in the chapter.",
