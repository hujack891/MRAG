With a loud gong, the trapped \"Admiral\" will use the cymbal to awaken a giant turtle whose mountainous shell you're actually standing on.\n\nAs the turtle begins to swim through the Bitter Seal, the woman will become aware of your presence, starting this new region off with a bang of a boss fight.\n\n\nAs long as your patient to wait for the right moments to get in close and attack, and make sure you're using shock-quelling medicine, you'll be able to come out on top.
