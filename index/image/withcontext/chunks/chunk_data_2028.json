The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Fungiwoman\n\nLike the Fungiman, this variant can fly through the air to slam down from above on you, only with this move they'll also create poison geysers all around them to spawn the aforementioned projectiles.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Another move they share is their rapid spin attack that will seek you out. Keep your distance or use Immobilize to score free hits, and then wait until they fall dizzy to hit them with more attacks.\n\nFor all their extra health, they don't have too many more moves than a regular enemy, so keep on the offensive so they don't have a chance to sprout more spore projectiles, using Immobilize to lock them down and Rock Solid when they try to swipe at you with their staff.\n\nOnce defeated, you'll gain a Knot of Voidness, and a Monkey-Head Fungus Seed to take back to the Zodiac Village, as well as their Fungiwoman Spirit to absorb.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
