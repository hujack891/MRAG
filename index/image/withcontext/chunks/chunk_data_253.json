You’ll also meet the owner of the voice on the wind - the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain.\n\nThis friendly guy will be your guide and mentor for this part of the world, and will bid you to set out in search of Guanyin Temple, which burned down long ago but has since been rebuilt - but not by human hands. As the Keeper departs, he’ll bestow you with the Incense Trail Talisman, which can let you warp back to the last Shrine you rested at.\n\n\nOpposite the balcony, you can spot some torches marking a tunnel passage into the rocks. Delve inside to find a familiar golden trail leading to the next Shrine. Now that you’ve grown, so to has the Shrine’s options, as you’ll be able to set Spells to your quickbar, reset your Skill Tree if you wish to experiment, and start buying and selling things at the store:\n\nBlack Wind Mountain Shrine Store\n| Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store          | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store    | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store  | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store |\n| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| Evil Repelling Medicament (x3) - 270 Will | Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Antimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will |                                  |\n| Yarn (x4) - 300 Will                      | Stone Spirit (x4) - 450 Will        |                                   |                                  |\n| Aged Ginseng (x5) - 90 Will               | Purple Lingzhi (x5) - 90 Will       | Gentian (x5) - 90 Will            | Jade Lotus (x5) - 90 Will        |\n| Snake-Head Mushroom (x5) - 120 Will       |                                     |                                   |                                  |\n\nSince you can’t craft medicine yet, you probably don’t need to be buying ingredients, but the medicines offered here are fairly rare to find in this chapter, so it won’t hurt to buy a few of each, and then sell any Pieces of Gold you’ve found.\n\n\nPick up the fiery blade, and you’ll learn a Transformation Spell: **Red Tides**. Now you’ll be able to transform into the very boss you defeated, and use his own abilities in combat against your enemies.\n\nTransformation Spells are very powerful, and essentially give you a separate health and might bar to work with. Might will decay fairly quickly over time, and even more if you charge up the transformation’s focus bar to employ special spell attacks. For this particular spell, you’ll be able to use Guangzhi’s spinning light attacks, and charge a heavy attack for his quick dashes. With a full focus bar, you can use Might on spell after dodging to employ his powerful pogo jump attack!\n\n## Black Wind Mountain’s Secret - Ringing the First Bell\n\nWith the Red Tides spell, you can try your luck against the Wandering Wight mini-boss next, or slip past him to find a tunnel beyond and return to him later once we can actually make use of the reward for defeating him.\"\n            - Following Text: \"On the other side of the tunnel, head across the long wooden scaffolding to find a path up to the famed Guanyin Temple. A few Wolf Guai are guarding the entrance, including an archer so be ready with the staff twirl to deflect the arrows, then charge them first.\n\n### Guanyin Temple\n\nAs you open the gate to the temple, the Keeper will warn you of a fearsome Yaoguai who lurks here, but that won’t be stopping you. Rest up at the Shrine, and be sure to look around for some loot before proceeding into the plaza:\n\n* Check the Shrine to find a new option: Armor Crafting. You can now use the materials you’ve been collecting like Yarn along with the Will you’ve accumulated to craft the ‘’’Pilgrim’s Set’’’. As an armor set, the more pieces you equip, the more benefits you’ll earn, and certain armor pieces like the Headband have their own unique effects regardless of how many pieces you equip!\n* Near the shrine is a small enclosed area with a green wisp in front of a wolf statue you can attempt to grab for a bit of Will, as well as the **Purple Lingzhi**.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
