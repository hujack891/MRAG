There isn't a set location or spot, you will just need to search for the purple Licorice plants throughout the game's chapters and hope that it drops for you. Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge has the most, especially in the early Sandgate Village area.\"\n            - Following Text: \"It isn't a super rare drop, so chances are you should find the Goat Skull quickly in Chapter 2.\n\nSoaks are far more plentiful than the Drinks for your Gourds.
