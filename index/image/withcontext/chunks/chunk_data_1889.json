Completing her side quest will unlock a secret boss for you to take on and a unique Curio.\n\n## Where to Find the Snow Fox\n\nWhen the story is over, examine the body and the fox will beg you to transform and wear the fur so you can confront the monk. After this, you'll automatically become the fox, and receive a Snow Fox Brush special item.\n\n\nGo up the sloped wooden bridge, and straight up the stairs to the left. This will bring you to the temple where the monk is. However, **this is also when you'll need to be in fox form**. Doing so will activate a cutscene and trigger a boss fight against the Yaoguai Chief Non-Void. Transform into the fox by using the Snow Fox Brush from your inventory, then step inside the temple.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Boss - Non-Void\n\nTo counter this, you want to get him to stay still as often as possible. So for this fight, you'll need to be quite aggressive to try and interrupt the flow of his attacks and keep him stunned for as long as you can.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Use Spirits that can deliver heavy hits like Wandering Wight. If you can land the head-smashing Faithful Kowtow move on him, you can knock him completely over. This will stagger him for a moment, giving you the chance to move in quickly to follow up with combos.\n\nTeam this spells like a Pluck of Many to overwhelm him, and transformations. Azure Dust is good if you can keep him pinned, so you can continue with the heavy attacks and build Might for a finisher while doing so. Alternatively, Red Tides works due to the quick nature of the attacks, and the ability to inflict burn damage.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
