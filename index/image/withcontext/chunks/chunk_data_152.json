Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby.\n\n## Rhino Watch Slope\n\nIn the midst of the trees, there's a small patch of ground with no grass. The Poison Chief can be found here.\n\n\nThankfully, each of the Poison Chief fights is pretty much the same. You can expect the same moveset and should prepare for them in the same way.\n\nWhen the second Poison Chief is down, return to the Rhino Watch Slope and then head into the area with the flames on the ground. A cutscene will play out as you get there, and the Gold Armored Rhino will appear.\n\n\nWhen you get to the edge, look down to see a muddy clearing. Down here, you can find the next optional boss, which is the final frog Lang-Baw-Baw.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Baw-Baw\n\nExpect to see him using rocks like shockwaves, where he'll punch the ground and disturb the ground underneath you, and also call rocks up into the air. When this happens, he'll roar and send them hurtling toward you. Another variation of a rock attack he performs is that a circle of rocks will spike up from the ground on occasion.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The key is to get him out of this state as soon as possible because it can be an annoying fight otherwise. It's easy to be killed when you're being bombarded with rock attacks in this phase. You can perform heavy attacks when he's in this phase, and you'll knock him flat and still do plenty of damage. But the best thing you can do is throw out the Plantain Fan. He'll go back to being red immediately, and be repeatedly pushed back. Stick close to him when the fan is hitting to keep attacking.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.
