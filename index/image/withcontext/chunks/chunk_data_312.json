Instead use your Cloud Step to get around and sneak attack.\n\n\nRealizing the error of his ways, the Man-in-Stone will promptly burrow right back in the ground and plead for mercy. You’ll then be able to re-harvest the Stone Essence from him, which will turn into the **Azure Dust Transformation Spell**! Finally, the slow yet sturdy power of the Rock Guai is yours to command in battle!\n\nUnlike the Red Waves wolf transformation, you’ll be extremely slow, unable to dodge, and overall be a pretty big target. On the plus side, you’ll be immune to all status effects while transformed, and deal incredible damage that staggers most enemies. Instead of Might building on attack, you’ll build it while taking damage, allowing you to soak blows and unleash a powerful jump attack spell in return!\n\nAs an added bonus, if you keep hassling the Man-in-Stone, he’ll promise to prepare wares to sell the next time you visit. Be sure to take him up on this offer, as he’ll have a decent selection of (very high-priced) goods!\n\nMan-in-Stone's Shop\n| Man-in-Stone's Shop                | Man-in-Stone's Shop           |\n| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| Blood of the Iron Bull - 3280 Will | Gold Ridge Beast - 12800 Will |\n| Iron Pellet - 6480 Will            |                               |\n| Goldflora Hairpin - 12800 Will     |                               |\n| Sobering Stone - 6480 Will         |                               |\n\n## Rockrest Flat\n\nBe sure to look around the vast field for items to gather like Fire Bellflower and Fragrant Jade Flowers. If you travel to the edge of the cliff past the field, you can find a **Meditation Point** by a large curved tree, giving you a free Skill Point!\n\nThe only other part of this field has a large gate that can’t currently be opened, so instead it’s time to return to the Shrine.\n\n### The Sixth Buddha’s Eyeball\"\n            - Following Text: \"From the Shrine at Rockrest Flat, look off to the left for a path leading to a large opening in the rocks. Just before the path opens up, you can find the final statue head, and claiming its eyes will cause a mantra to be chanted, “Om Mani Padme Hum”, confirming you’ve found the final eye!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
