Hiding across several rope bridges outside the middle of the Webbed Hollow, this boss can't be activated until you obtain a Key Item in the previous chapter. Yellow Loong is the final of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n\n* Rewards: Golden Lining Transformation Spell, Sea-Supporting Tendon, Golden Carp Curio, Kun Steel, Loong Pearl, Mind Core, 6998 Experience, 5049 Will\n\n\nYou can enter the crack in the wall, and on the other side you’ll find a chest containing the Loong Scales.

He may also hold his weapon under his other arm, or angle it downward, and each has its own timing.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Worse still, after dashing at you 2-3 times, he'll start alternating slams where he strikes the ground at your position with a huge lightning blast, rather than charging past you. This can also go on for several hits with different wind-up speeds, and when electrified, a single mistake can spell doom.\n\nThere is one caveat: The key to surviving this attack string is to stop it before it starts, and there are a few special ways to stop him:\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
