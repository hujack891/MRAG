Combat in Black Myth: Wukong can be quite the challenge, so picking up all of the Awaken Wine Worms to get the most out of your healing is essential.\n\nAwaken Wine Worms can be rather difficult to find but are always contained in pots with a golden glow spilling out from underneath the lid. Here, we have the locations of all Awaken Wine Worms so you can collect any you may have missed along your travels.\n\nYou can use your Awaken Wine Worms at the Monkey's cave in the Marsh of the White Mist.\n\n* Black Wind Cave Awaken Wine Worm\n* Marsh of the White Mist Awaken Wine Worms\n* Yellow Wind Ridge Awaken Wine Worm\n* Outside the Pagoda Awaken Wine Worm\n* Longevity Road Awaken Wine Worm\n* The Estate of the Zhu Awaken Wine Worm\n* Temple of the Yellow Flowers Awaken Wine Worm\n* Purple Cloud Mountain Awaken Wine Worm\n* Rakshasa Palace Awaken Wine Worm\n* Bishui Cave Awaken Wine Worm\n\n\nThe Awaken Wine Worm in Chapter 1 is hidden in a temple guarded by the Black Wind King.

Turn left and follow the path downhill and to the right, where you will encounter the Turtle Treasure Yaoguai. Defeat it and break the barrel it was guarding to collect the next Awaken Wine Worm.\n\n\nUpon starting Chapter 4, you will find yourself in a small town called the Estate of the Zhu, where you will fight the Second Sister. Explore one of the shacks to the right of the Second Sister fight arena to find the next Awaken Wine Worm.\n\n\nHead through the door on the right when you enter the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Run up the stairs, defeat the Snake Shriff Spirit, and go through the door it was guarding to find the Awaken Wine Worm in a barrel underneath a large tree.\n\n\nMake your way to Petalfall Hamlet in Purple Cloud Mountain and run up the path until you reach a large stone gateway. Pass through the gate and turn left immediately upon entering to find a small stone staircase. Go up the stairs to find the Awaken Wine Worm.\n\n\nMake your way to the edge of the lava lake in Rakshasa Palace and turn left to find a large temple carved into the cliff face. The Awaken Wine Worm is inside the temple along the back wall.\n\n## Bishui Cave Awaken Wine Worm\"\n            - Following Text: \"There is a small staircase covered in ice in the Corridor of Ice and Fire in Bushui Cave.
