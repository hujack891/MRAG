Below you'll find a guide for the first upper area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find your first encounter with the Venom Daoist, and the different ways to reach The Verdure Bridge.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Upper Hollow**\n* **Pool of Shattered Jade**\n- Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nBefore following the golden trail of a nearby Shrine, look to the left of the bed and small chest to find a path leading to another larger **Treasure Chest** you can open to claim a **Cuo Jin-Yin Belt Hook Curio** , another item that can help resist all the poison you'll be encountering.\n\n## Upper Hollow\nA note on cocoons: you'll encounter many of these throughout the Webbed Hollow, in various shapes and sizes. Some contain enemies and will wriggle about as you approach, but it is sometimes possible to attack the cocoon fast enough to stop whatever is inside from emerging. The smaller cocoons don't have yaoguais within, but do provide Will when broken. Even better, this area is likely to give you up to three **Rice Cocoons** when breaking a random tiny cocoon, and one or more **Spine in the Sack Curios** when breaking slightly larger cocoons, so they're worth destroying as you progress!\"\n            - Following Text: \"Watch out for a few Grasshopper Guai trapped in some of the larger cocoons as you approach a large hole in the middle of the path with an archer on the far side. There's actually a wooden ledge near here that offers one of two ways to drop down to a lower level, but we'll backtrack to this spot later since it's a lengthy and one-way trip.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
