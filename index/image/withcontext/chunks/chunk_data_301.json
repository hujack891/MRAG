Instead use your Cloud Step to get around and sneak attack.\n\n## Squall Hideout\n\n\nThe large cave entrance has a few paths, with the outer one on the right leading past another Pitstone to a wooden coffin chest holding 3 **Silk** and some **Will**.\n\n\nStart by luring the shieldless Spearbone out of range of the Blazebones above, then climb the stairs to rush down the projectile throwers. Be sure to look at the ruined home at the first landing below the first Blazebone for a yellow chest that has 2 **Yaoguai Core** and 3 **Tiny Piece of Gold**.\n\n\nAt the end of the crevice, you’ll find an unusual looking stone. He’s actually a Man-in-Stone, and claims to have been trapped within the rock form. He’s betting on one of the rock guai in the large cave nearby to hold the secrets to reversing his fate, and asks you to seek it out.\n\n\nAt the end of the cave path, you’ll find the object of the Man-in-Stone’s quest - an even larger statue embedded with shining blue crystals. Don’t get too enraptured that you miss a Poisestone along the walls trying to ambush you, though.\n\nUpon reaching the end of the large cave system where you’ll find the Mother of Stones, look for a large opening to the right to exit back outside and onto a cliff edge. There’s a raised platform here, and you’ll find another statue head to harvest its Buddha Eyeball.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Mother of Stones\n\nThere’s one last wave of two after this, for a total of six Palestones for the whole fight. Again, don’t hold back, and use your Transformation Spell to power down at least one of the enemies as quickly as possible so you aren’t overwhelmed. Don’t be afraid to back well off and heal to stay out of range of their projectiles.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once all six Palestones are down, there’s nothing left that the Mother of Stones can do, so keep smacking it until the boss breaks apart. You’ll be awarded the **Stone Essence** Key Item, as well as some Stone Spirits and Yaoguai Cores.\n\nRest up, and then return to the Man-in-Stone. You may want to also clear out the Bladebones above him just so they don’t harass you as you try to turn in the Stone Essence.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
