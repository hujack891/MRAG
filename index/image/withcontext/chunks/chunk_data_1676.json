An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n## Village Entrance\n\nThe Xu Dog as he’s known has a problem he needs help with: A large frog has swallowed one of his medicinal formulas, and you’re just the person he’s looking for to get it back.\n\n\nHeading to the left of the lone shack, you’ll find a gate guarded by a Rat Governor and another Archer on the rooftops that connects to the one you climbed earlier. Defeat them to gain access to a large open field inside the Village’s main area. From across the field, a voice pleading to be freed calls out, but in your way is a large loping creature that will want to engage you first.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Earth Wolf\n\nIt will often start the fight with a leaping attack, using its head to ram into you as it rolls when it hits the ground. Wait until it comes crashing down to dodge, then move along with it to keep attacking as it rights itself.\"\n            - Following Text: \"It can also try to perform a short distance pounce to land on top of you, which moves much quicker than its headbutt leap. If you can evade this one, it will waste time looking around to find that it missed its grab, letting you get your hits in.\n\nHowever, if you get locked in the grab, you’ll be tossed up in the air and land right on its bony back and horns, taking major damage as it shakes you off. Watch for both of its paws to reach out to know when to dodge this move.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
