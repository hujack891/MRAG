It is dropped by a Yaoguai Chief Miniboss called the Tiger’s Acolyte. This boss battle can be found at the far end of the Yellow Wind Formation region, at the very end of the **Windrest Hamlet** along a large stone bridge leading back to the Fright Cliff region.\n\nAfter defeating the Tiger’s Acolyte, you’ll gain the Old-Rattle Drum, which appears to have belonged to the Acolyte’s son, but no other details are provided. You will need to find three areas where you can use the drum to summon a spirit, in **locations all across the Yellow Wind Ridge**. The only clue you’ll have is that entering the correct area will **cause your vision to warp** , and the ghostly voice of a boy calling out to you.\n\n\nThe first location you can use the Old-Rattle Drum is close to where you fought the Tiger’s Acolyte, further back in the **Windrest Hamlet**. Return across the bridge to the **Windrest Hamlet Shrine** and pass back through the large gate, immediately taking a left to the **large house surrounded by sitting Withering Corpses**.\n\nA visual cue will appear along with the **voice of a child** beckoning you, and you’ll be able to use the Rattle-Drum in front of the house. Be warned, as doing so will provoke all the nearby corpses to attack you, but you’ll also get some interesting dialogue from the child.\n\n\nOn the other side of the ruined building, there’s a long roof-like walkway and several Withering Corpses milling about, along with a Ginsengling hiding by a wooden chest. If you already used the Old Rattle-Drum back in Windrest Hamlet, you’ll again hear the spirit of a boy call out to you. Use the drum here, and prepare to fend off the zombies as he speaks to you. Interestingly, he mentions a **secret and a well** before clamming up, giving you one final clue to the third location.\n\n\nUnfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there. You can interact with the well to drop down to a secret area, where you’ll face off against an incredibly tough and dangerous secret boss, the **Mad Tiger**.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Battle - Mad Tiger\n\nThere are certain times after performing slam attacks that he may keep his claws deep in the ground. If he continues to crouch down while charging up, it means he’ll rip his fists out to send a shower of rocks erupting in your path.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Other times, he’ll begin to pick up a massive boulder, but instead of tossing it, he’ll leap across the room to personally deliver the massive rock to your face, which can deal a ton of damage.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
