Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby.\n\n\nAs you get close to the edge of the cliff, you'll find another clearing with a rock in the middle. This is the third Poison Chief in the region.\n\nWhen you've beaten the third Poison Chief, head over to the start of the red trees. As you enter the clearing with the lightning, you'll find the next Keeper's Shrine on the left.\n\n## Deer Sight Forest\n\nActivate the Deer Sight Forest Keeper's Shrine and go toward the lightning and red tree in the middle of the clearing. Underneath the tree sits the Cloudtreading Deer.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Cloudtreading Deer\n\nIt will start by attacking with its horns, sweeping at you to try and hit you. It will also rear up, and hold itself for a few seconds, before slamming down and sending out ripples of frost damage. If you get behind it, just like the Rhino, it will buck to kick you with its hind legs.\"\n            - Following Text: \"In this first phase, you'll want to have plenty of Body-Warming Powder, as the Cloudtreading Deer uses frost as its elemental attacks. But the most dangerous aspect of this first stage is the fact that the deer sends out lots of little tornadoes. While the small whirlwinds of ice are easy to dodge, these tornadoes are much harder to avoid and also signal when the deer will ramp up its attacks.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
