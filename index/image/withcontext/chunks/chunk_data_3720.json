Expect to dodge lots of belly flops and huge swipes with the upper portion of its body. Thankfully, the Elder Armourworm is quite slow, so you should be able to dodge most attacks without too much trouble.\n\n## How to Get the Elder Armourworm Spirit\n\nOnce unlocked, Zodiac Village is where you can find all of the 'shop' NCPs, like the Xu Dog, Shen Monkey, and a new blacksmith character named Yin Tiger. Chen Loong will also reside there.\n\nSpeak to Chen Loong and hand over an item called the Proto Armourworm. The Proto Armourworm will turn up in a small basket just above the seed baskets outside Chen Loong's hut. You need to feed the Proto Armourworm three Rice Cocoons to make it grow into a Spirit that you can absorb the next time you visit the village.\n\nYou can get Rice Cocoons from egg sacks throughout the Webbed Hollow!\n\n### Elder Armourworm Spirit\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Foul Spray**\n* Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Critical Hit Chance when in Poisoned state.\n\nThe Elder Armourworm's Spirit allows you to take the form of the great worm and flail about the arena, spraying poison everywhere. These poisonous pools deal Poison Bane to any enemies who make contact with them. They don't do any damage to you, though, so you don't have to worry about watching your step after the move is complete. If you do become poisoned for any other reason, however, the Elder Armourworm's equipped effect increases your Critical Hit Chance until the effect has worn off.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
