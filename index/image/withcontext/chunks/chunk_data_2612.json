Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nThe easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step. Cast it near the start of the rope bridge, and then sprint all the way to the other end, and don't try to staff spin if any arrows come your way, or you're likely to walk off the side by accident.\n\n\nRather helpfully, there's a brazier by a ledge nearby, and looking down you can find a spot to drop back down to the two bridges we noted at the start of the Lower Hollow, putting you quickly back on track to the main pathway.\n\n\nBe sure to climb back up the ledges (use a jumping heavy attack to gain height), and continue to follow this path to a flooded cave where this chapter's Frog Boss awaits.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n\nWhat used to be a standard straight tongue attack will now also retract while he fires to projectiles as the hand flicks its fingers to fire magic darts in quick succession, meaning even if you dodge the tongue-hand shooting out, you need to dodge when it retracts as well.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He can also wave the tongue-hand around in a haphazard fashion, making it weave in a large arc from side to side as it swipes at you three times, before rising high up to slam down at you (but you can use Rock Solid to send him tumbling back in surprise).\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
