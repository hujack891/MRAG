Below you'll find a guide for the Bitter Lake Region, including how to defeat Kang-Jin Star and the Cyan Loong on Turtle Island, and how to navigate the North Shore to unlock the Zodiac Village and defeat the Apramana Bat -- plus where to find the four Buddha Statues.\n\n* Yaoguai King - Kang-Jin Star\n* **Turtle Island**\n- Yaoguai King - Cyan Loong\n* **North Shore of the Bitter Lake**\n- Boss Fight - Chen Loong\n- Yaoguai Chief - Apramana Bat\n* **Precept Corridor**\n\nLeaving the Warding Temple where you learned the Ring of Fire Spell from the Ancient Master, you'll have to slide down a long slope to reach a mountaintop where a giant pair of cymbals have been wedged into a mountain peak.\"\n            - Following Text: \"As you draw close, you'll hear a voice coming from the cymbals, who is arguing with a woman refusing to let the trapped person out. With a loud gong, the trapped \"Admiral\" will use the cymbal to awaken a giant turtle whose mountainous shell you're actually standing on.\n\nAs the turtle begins to swim through the Bitter Seal, the woman will become aware of your presence, starting this new region off with a bang of a boss fight.\n\n## Yoaguai King Boss Fight - Kang-Jin Star\n\nLike the other Kang-Jin, expect this fight to involve a heaping helping of electricity, and stock up accordingly on Shock-Quelling medicine, or you'll be taking a lot of damage. Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n            \n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",

The text also mentions leaving the Warding Temple and sliding down a slope to reach a mountaintop with cymbals embedded in the peak, setting the stage for the next sequence.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a colossal turtle with a mountainous shell emerging from the water, emphasizing its immense size and dramatic presence. This visual likely represents Turtle Island, where the giant turtle plays a significant narrative role, as described in the context. The turtle's shell, resembling a mountain, aligns with the preceding text's mention of standing on its back.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text describes the turtle awakening as part of the Bitter Lake region's introduction. A trapped \"Admiral\" uses the cymbals to summon the turtle, initiating a dramatic sequence where the turtle begins swimming through the Bitter Seal.
