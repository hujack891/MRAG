The Plantain Fan can prove invaluable here once again, especially if you deploy it just before a poison attack. It will push the Poison Chief back and allow you to follow up with attacks. Use Immobilize when the Plantain Fan has stopped working, to keep it in place and deplete its health as quickly as possible.\n\n\nOn the opposite side of the water, there's a clearing, with what appears to be a big rock sitting by the edge of it. This is actually one of the Poison Chiefs in the area, so fly over to it to tackle your next miniboss.\n\n\nIn the midst of the trees, there's a small patch of ground with no grass. The Poison Chief can be found here.\n\n\nWhen you've beaten Lang-Baw-Baw, fly up again and look to the opposite side of the water. You'll see red trees in the distance, but it's the area on the right you'll want to go to first.\n\n\nAs you get close to the edge of the cliff, you'll find another clearing with a rock in the middle. This is the third Poison Chief in the region.\n\n## How to Find Poison Chief 4\"\n            - Following Text: \"Head back to the Keeper's Shrine once you've defeated the Cloudtreading Deer. Fly up high again, and look straight ahead for another rocky part of the cliff. It'll be hard to see from here, but fly straight forward and you should see a distinctive tall white tree. Next to it is a clearing, where you can find the final Poison Chief.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
