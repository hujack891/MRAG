Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the grove and learning how to cultivate Spirits, accessing a secret realm, as well as how to defeat the many bosses of this area that include Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, Guangmou, and the Whiteclad Noble.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Back Hills**\n* **Snake Trail**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Guangmo\n* **Marsh of the White Mist**\n- Boss FIght - Whiteclad Noble\n\n\nTo advance, keep heading up the stairway to cross the high bridge over the falls, where you’ll soon see the golden trail of a nearby shrine beckoning you left. Before making that turn, be sure to look to the right to find a small wooden gazebo with a small table, and open the small gold box on top to find a variety of medicines, including 2 **Tiger Subduing Pellets** , 1 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 1 **Amplification Pellet**.\n\n## Snake Trail\n\nThis path leads to a marshy swamp area full of tall white reed flowers. Several Croaky enemies hide within them, so use your lock-on to identify them so you aren’t ambushed. However, as you make your way through the marsh toward a large stone mural in the cliffs, an optional mini-boss will leap out to fight you.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n\nHis most standard attack includes a series of swipes with both arms that sends him forward, ending in a small leaping splash attack that allows him to reposition. By dodging the first swipe to the side, you can wait for him to leap back towards you and then use Immobilize to keep in place while you attack. He can also use any of these swipes and slams independently as well as in a three-hit combo, so look for a follow-up attack before deciding to commit to countering with your own attacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"There are two extremely fast and damaging attacks you’ll need to beware of. The first comes when he’s directly facing you, and the toad will pause momentarily lowering his arms across his chest. He’ll then lunge at you belly first in an extremely quick dash, and you’ll have to dodge the body slam quickly to the side before striking back.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
