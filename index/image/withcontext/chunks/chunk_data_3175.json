Stamina is a core skill in Black Myth: Wukong that affects how far you can sprint and even how many combos you can produce. If you want as much Stamina as possible, here is where you can find each and every Celestial Nonary Pill.\n\n* Black Wind Mountain Celestial Nonary Pill\n* Yellow Wind Ridge Celestial Nonary Pill\n* Xu-Dog Celestial Nonary Pills\n* The New West Celestial Nonary Pill\n* The Webbed Hollow Celestial Nonary Pill\n* Flaming Mountains Celestial Nonary Pill\n\n\nAfter defeating the Black Wind King and unlocking the Cloud Step spell, continue along the path up the hill until you reach an ambush. Once you've fought through the enemies there, keep climbing to Bodhi Peak and you will find the pill in a golden chest on the left.\n\n\nThe Yellow Wind Ridge Celestial Nonary Pill is hidden in a secret area near the First Prince of Flowing Sands. Take out the enemies near the wooden plank opposite the arena and follow the path to a crack in the wall. Squeeze through the crack, take out the Swift Bat, absorb its Spirit, and pass through the door at the end of the room. Head to the back of the rock alcove to find the Celestial Nonary Pill.\n\n\nFall down the sand slide after exploring the Crouching Tiger Temple Cellar to meet the Xu-Dog. The Xu-Dog crafts Celestial Medicines for you in exchange for Mind Cores. You can craft a total of nine Celestial Nonary Pills with the Xu-Dog. You can find Mind Cores in chests or as loot for defeating particularly vicious foes.\n\n\nThis Nonary Pill is on the grounds of the New Thunderclap Temple. Once you enter the temple grounds, run straight through the second entrance and take the stairs on the left. Head into the building on the left and run up the stairs inside to reach the second story.
