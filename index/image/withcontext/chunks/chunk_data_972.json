Located in both the Snowhill Path, Pagoda Realm and Thunderclap Temple, this tricky opponent is hard to pin down.\n\n* **Rewards:** Will, Ring of Fire Spell (Second Encounter), Refined Iron Sand, Random Materials, 1847 Experience (Final Encounter)\n\n## Where to Find the Macaque Chief\n\nAs a required boss fight, you'll encounter the Macaque Chief in multiple points when exploring The New West and progressing to reach the Sage's Will held by Goldenbrow.\n\nThe first time you'll encounter this enemy is early in the Snowhill Path as you reach a plateau along the Snowclad Path after you spot the monkey awakening the Frozen Corpses.\n\nOnce defeated, the Macaque Chief will flee, only to appear later on in the Pagoda Realm after you have escaped the prison. You'll find him just inside the Warding Temple, harassing the Wise Master until you intervene.\n\nAfter a second defeat, you'll face him one last time near the end of the chapter, in-between two bouts that you'll have with the end boss, Yellowbrow.\n\n* First Encounter\n* Second Encounter\n* Final Encounter\n\n\nFinally, if you spend to much time dishing out damage to his face, he'll eventually counter with an unexpected move: puking on you. This will deal an immense amount of poison buildup, so be ready to Immobilize or dodge around behind him.\n\nWith his small frame, the Macaque Chief is fairly susceptible to being staggered with charged up heavy strikes. Build up your focus from light attack combos when dodging him, and then knock him down with big hits or after deflecting his moves.\n\n\nWhen you fight him a second time, he'll largely have the same moves, but as an added bonus for this fight, you can actually use the Ancient Master's circle of fire to your own advantage, as the Macaque Chief can't move through it. If you ever see him preparing for a big series of slashes or need to get away and heal simply move to the opposite side of the circle, and his attacks won't reach you.\n\n### Final Encounter - Mahavira Hall\n\nFor this last bout with the Macaque Chief, your friend Zhu Bajie will be here to help, but will warn you that the sack's magic draws out evil to empower this foe beyond his normal limits.\n\nEven though you'll have the help of a friend, don't expect this to be an easy fight, as the Macaque Chief hits harder than ever with his evil sword. On the plus side, your health, mana, and gourd will be fully replenished after the Yellowbrow fight, and if you are defeated here, you can re-enter the temple to skip the first fight and pick up where you left off.\n\nA lot of the Macaque Chief's attacks should look familiar, which is a good thing as you'll be able to accurately react and avoid his most common attacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Expect him to employ his reliable sword stab where the claws out in front of him before grabbing the sword back with his legs to swing at you with, but the range will be greatly increased.\n\nHe also employs a lot of usual blade swipes, and his multi-hit spinning two-handed swings, which now create large projectiles slashes in front of him.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
