Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby.\n\n## Rhino Watch Slope\n\nIn the midst of the trees, there's a small patch of ground with no grass. The Poison Chief can be found here.\n\n\nThankfully, each of the Poison Chief fights is pretty much the same. You can expect the same moveset and should prepare for them in the same way.\n\nWhen the second Poison Chief is down, return to the Rhino Watch Slope and then head into the area with the flames on the ground. A cutscene will play out as you get there, and the Gold Armored Rhino will appear.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Gold Armored Rhino\n\nOnce its horn is broken, it’ll try to get away from you. Use Immobilize if needed to keep the Rhino in place, then quickly use Wandering Wight to smash the horn. Follow this up with Pluck of Many and the Plantain Fan to knock the Rhino over repeatedly and overwhelm it with your duplicates.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When you can't use the Wandering Wight, you need to build focus quickly. Alternatively, just keep holding charge until you’ve built your focus up. If you’re building your focus up naturally, then it’s worth using Immobilize when it's ready again to get the Rhino to stand still so you'll have more chance of hitting your target. You don't want to waste your attacks in this, otherwise, you could be in for a lengthy fit.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
