One of several possible frog guai bosses you can defeat, this one lurks in the Valley of Ecstasy, and has the power of frost on its side.\n\n* **Rewards:** Tadpole, Cold Iron Leaves, Random Materials, 1270 Experience, 904 Will\n\n## Where to Find Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n\nAs soon as you arrive in the Forest of Felicity, you can find two small tunnels in the ridge on the left, one before and after the Shrine, and both lead to a canyon with a frozen pond where the frog boss waits for you.\n\n### Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nHis tongue-lashing attack has now been altered to be even more deadly: It will create fields of frost on the ground as it swings back and forth -- and also lob rocks at you each time his tongue whips back, forcing you to stay mobile out of the frost and dodging the boulders at the same time.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He can also take a deep breath and bellow chilled air straight at you, which can make it tough to get out of his range unless you lock him down with Immobilize or Cloud Step away.\n\nAny time his icy attacks create a frost field, you'll need to evacuate quickly from the affected area, or you'll rapidly become chilled and eventually immobile while your stamina is sapped.\n\nRemember to take control of the battlefield, and dictate where the fighting happens by luring him away from any lingering frost field that tend to stay longer than you'd expect. He'll always end up coming to you, so back up and be ready to retaliate when he lunges forth.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
