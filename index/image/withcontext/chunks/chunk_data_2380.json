Though it is a short area, it will prove to be a challenging one as you go up against the greedy King of the Mountain. Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the cave to the mountaintop, as well as how to defeat the boss of this area in his two forms, the Black Wind King and the Black Bear Guai.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Cave Interior**\n- Black Wind King\n* **Outside the Cave**\n* **Bodhi Peak**\n- Black Bear Guai\n\n\nReturn to the path and take the stairs up to fight against another Wolf Assassin as the cave grows dark, and draw them into the light if needed.\n\nAs you reach an open part of the cave, you’ll have to face one more assassin along the darkened path, and you may notice they’ll go out of their way to destroy the torches along the path to further envelop them in darkness. If you have trouble facing them, always try to bring them to a brighter spot.\n\nNote that if you went ahead and defeated the Secret Boss by ringing the three bells, you should also have access to craft an additional Bronze Set that improves your abilities using the Immobilize Spell!\n\nCraft and upgrade whatever you can afford at the moment, because a boss is waiting inside the temple to test your might, and he’s no pushover.\n\n\nCheck the sides of the cave to find some Jade Lotus and Aged Ginseng, then head to the far end to sidle through an exit. This disguised loading screen will turn the day into dusk as you find yourself closer to the top of the mountain.\n\n\nThe rest of the long stairway up is lined with assorted Wolf Guai, but between your new Cloud Step, Spirit Attacks, and other new moves, they won’t stand a chance against you. Be sure to look along the left by some graves to find some Aged Ginseng as you keep heading upward. If you run out of mana for your Cloud Step, just keep enemies or the environment between you and the Wolf Archer’s opening salvo, and then rush them when they start shooting single arrows again.\n\n\nWhen you’ve at least reached the top of the mountain, it’s time to do one final inventory before approaching the final boss of Chapter 1:\n\n* Make sure you’ve rung the 3 bells, and fought the secret boss to obtain the Legendary Fireproof Mantle.\n* With the secret boss defeated, you’ll be able to craft most if not all of the Bronze Gear Set for the best armor increase and Immobilize bonuses.\n* You should have also claimed all 3 Celestial Pills to increase your max health, mana, and stamina.\n* Make sure you’ve defeated that optional strong mini-boss, the Wandering Wight back in the Forest of Wolves, not only to gain his Spirit, but to obtain the Cat’s Eye Beads Curio.\n* Cultivate the Spirit you like the most with at least two upgrades if possible (we recommend the Wight for its passive defense increase and massive damaging headbutt).\n* Ensure both your Gourd and Coconut Wine have both been upgraded by the Shen Monkey, and equip the Lotus Seeds as your soak.\n\nThis is also a good time to buy the rest of the medicinal items from the store at the Shrine. They don’t replenish over time, and the wares will be different when you reach the next chapter, so there’s no real reason not to stock up.\n\nOnce you’re ready, head up to the peak to find a large pagoda where the first of the Six Senses of the Great Sage rests. Before you can claim it, you’ll have to go through the true form of the Black Wind King.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Black Bear Guai\n\nHowever, once he’s at a bit less than half of his health, he’ll retreat away and let loose a roar as he slams the ground, engulfing himself in flames as several eruptions take over the arena. Dodge away from them, and if you find yourself burning, either roll repeatedly or use a cooling powder.\"\n            - Following Text: \"This is also a key moment to use the Fireproof Mantle from defeating the secret boss. It will not only negate a lot of fire damage, but slowly build your focus up over time to unleash more heavy attacks in your combos.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
