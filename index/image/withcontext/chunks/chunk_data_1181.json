Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n- Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\n\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\n\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n\n\nInside the side room, there's another large tree that a Supporter Monk is facing, but a Wolf Guardian will try to ambush you as you approach him. You can also find a Ginsengling around the tree roots by trying to harvest some Aged Ginseng.\n\nCarefully head through the open doorway into the side plaza, and look for a small alcove on the left for a green Wisp to absorb. However, once you begin to explore this area, a Yaoguai Chief will emerge from a nearby altar.\n\n\nThe large gateway at the end of this path is guarded by three Overseeing Monks, one apart from the others, but all can be lured away independently due to their short-range senses.\n\n## Temple Main Plaza\n\nAt the top of the stairs, you can look left to find the two sets of stairs back down to the Temple Entrance's main path where four Thunder Rhino Masters have gathered -- attacking them from the back will allow you to ambush them one by one.\n\nIt's worth noting that this area only has two real Shrines, and the other is up near the boss room past two Dark-faced Overlords. Given there's more optional bosses and enemies to face, it's not a bad idea to go back and rest at the entrance before making a beeline through the side path to return to the main plaza.\n\nAt the top of the stairs where all the mages were positioned, there's actually not too much to find here. Several Monk Supporters patrol the building exterior, where you can also find a few Overseeing Monks training along the corners.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The interior building hides three more Overseeing Monks and a patrolling Dual-Blade Monk, but nothing in the way of actual rewards.\n\nIf you want to advance to the main boss, the large stairway on the other side of the building will lead you to the Inner Courtyard, but there's another optional side path to explore first, on the opposite side as the other optional path we explored earlier.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
