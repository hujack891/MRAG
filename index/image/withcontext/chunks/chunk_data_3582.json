Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the grove and learning how to cultivate Spirits, accessing a secret realm, as well as how to defeat the many bosses of this area that include Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, Guangmou, and the Whiteclad Noble.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Back Hills**\n* **Snake Trail**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Guangmo\n* **Marsh of the White Mist**\n- Boss FIght - Whiteclad Noble\n\n\nTo advance, keep heading up the stairway to cross the high bridge over the falls, where you’ll soon see the golden trail of a nearby shrine beckoning you left. Before making that turn, be sure to look to the right to find a small wooden gazebo with a small table, and open the small gold box on top to find a variety of medicines, including 2 **Tiger Subduing Pellets** , 1 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 1 **Amplification Pellet**.\n\n\nAnother good strategy to note is that if you’re in danger of getting close to becoming poisoned, using the Red Tides spell can help you transform out of danger. Any status effects suffered while transformed as Guangzhi will be removed when you regain your regular health bar. As an added bonus, Guangmou will even comment on your transformation.\n\nOnce you’ve learned how to evade his projectiles, the rest of the fight will just boil down to chasing him down and stunning him however you can with Immobilize, your Spirit Attack, and other heavy hits. When he falls, you’ll gain Guangmou’s Spirit to add to your collection, allowing you to summon venomous snakes of your own!\n\n\nWhen you’re ready to move on, make sure you’re fully healed up from dealing with that snake, as the end of this downward path leads to the titular marsh where a very strong boss waits to block your path.\n\n## Boss Fight - Whiteclad Noble\n\nUnfortunately, you’re going to need to memorize these attacks and learn to take as little damage as possible, because depleting his health bar won’t end the fight. When you’ve knocked him down, he’ll begin to show you his true form, elongating his body in a larger serpent form, and replenishing his entire health bar.\"\n            - Following Text: \"For phase two, you’ll find that many of his attacks are pretty similar to the first phase, and he doesn’t have too many extra surprises up his sleeve. Due to his new posture, his 360 degree circle spin attack is a bit harder to see coming as his spear will dip into the water, so you’ll need to watch him moves carefully.\n\nSometimes, he’ll raise his spear higher, and will do a frontal sweep rather than his spin, but his snake body will quickly slither off before you can counter, meaning you’ll have to Immobilize him instead or quickly follow him.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
