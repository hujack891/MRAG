As a tutorial boss, the Bullguard is designed to test your abilities in dealing with a strong foe, but you'll be helped along the way learning an important spell from the Keeper of Black Mountain.\n\n* **Rewards:** Immobilize Spell, Yarn x2, 482 Experience, 390 Will\n\n## Where to Find the Bullguard\n\nSince the Bullguard is a required miniboss, he can't be missed on your journey through the opening areas of Chapter 1. You'll find him in the Forest of Wolves, not far from the Front Hills Shrine just along the main path across a bridge, keeping to the right. The Bullguard blocks a large gate area leading to the next main region of Black Wind Mountain.\n\n### Bullguard Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nThe Bullguard swings a mean halberd, which he can use to perform devastating overhand slams, and much quicker horizontal slashes that swing twice before a third overhead attack. Luckily, each of these combo hits usually end with him taking a long time to pull his weapon back out of the ground and reset his positioning, which is the perfect time to strike with a light combo or sneak in a heavy attack when he’s recovering.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He can also perform multiple overhead swings at once ending with a massive jump attack, so it’s safe to assume that unless he’s charging at you, his swings will almost always come out in multiple hits, and you’ll want to be ready to dodge them all first before you move in and attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.

Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
