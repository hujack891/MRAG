From the Shrine, you can also hop down a nearby ditch and pass under a bridge to find a tunnel leading to a friendly Xu Dog Guai, who will ask for your help in defeating the Yaoguai Chief.\n\n### Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nBe sure not to attack too much from the frog’s rear, as its quick hop mule kick can deal a ton of damage with little warning. If you see his arms cross, he’ll bloat his chest out for a frontal assault.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Several of its new electric attacks can deal a flurry of damage if you aren’t prepared to deal with them. The usual tell will be when the frog’s throat swells with electric energy. He will then shoot out dozens of electrified tadpoles — sometimes in a large frontal arc around him, and sometimes he’ll just spew them out and have them scatter around him.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
