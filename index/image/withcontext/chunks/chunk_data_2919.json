Located at the far end of the Fright Cliff, you'll first have to fetch several items for this Drunken Boar before you can fight him to unlock a Secret Area.\n\n* **Rewards:** Snout Mask, 1102 Experience, 1037 Will\n\n## Where to Find the Yellow-Robed Squire\n\nBefore you fight the Yellow-Robed Squire, you'll first need to sober him up with an appropriately named Sobering Stone. One can be bought from the Man-in-Stone after you've completed his questline earlier in the region and he's opened his shop. If you don't want to buy one, you can also find one in a glowing pot located in the Windrest Hamlet just past the Windrest Bridge in the Yellow Wind Formation area. Search for a large house on the left as you enter the village, and you'll find it in an alcove guarded by a Blazebone enemy.\"\n            - Following Text: \"After sobering up, the Drunken Boar will then head to the Crouching Tiger Temple, and there request that you get him some tasty Jade Lotus -- which can be harvested in most pools of water.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
