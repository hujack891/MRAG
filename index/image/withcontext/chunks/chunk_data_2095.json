The cursed and undead remains of a celestial rooster guai, you can find this monster at the peak of the Purple Cloud Mountain, a secret area of the Webbed Hollow.\n\n* Rewards: Weaver's Needle Vessel, Duskveil's Horn, Kun Steel, Double-Combed Rooster Blood, Gold Tree Core, Mind Core, 3410 Experience, 2595 Will\n\n\nThe Duskveil is an optional Yaoguai King, though required to complete the region and return to the Temple of Yellow Flowers. It is highly recommended that you defeat both The Scorpionlord and Daoist Mi before taking on The Duskveil, as defeating it may cause them to disappear.\n\nTo reach Purple Cloud Mountain, you will have to defeat the Venom Daoist twice - both in the Upper Webbed Hollow, and in a side path outside the Temple of Yellow Flowers main area. This will unlock a mural allowing you to travel to this new area.\n\nOnce you reach the first main shrine at the Valley of Blooms, stick to the left side to find a path up to the Petalfall Village, and continue along either path up to reach the peak, where the main boss lies.\n\n## The Duskveil Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe Duskveil has a few more ways of forming his sword, and are much harder to see coming. These often happen when he sprays a damaging blood mist in front of him, obscuring him from view -- which means retreating backward can be a wise decision if you want to play it safe.\"\n            - Following Text: \"From the mist, he can either launch into his quick single arm jab, or his new attack where he coughs out his sword from his mouth to stab through the mist and into the ground in front of him.\n\nAfter grabbing the sword, he'll jump back, and launch a series of projectiles slashes you'll need to dodge one at a time. Luckily, they are evenly spaced, and the timing isn't hard to get down.\n\nYou'll also find that more than a few of his regular combos from the first phase have been amplified and require further defensive actions. His arm sweeps for example can now extend into The Duskveil quickly pulling out his sword into two sweeping spin attacks, and blend into the other combo where he throws his sword into the ground.\n\nHis fluttering jump slam can now be extended as he flies back up to slam down a second time, then takes to the air again to pull his sword out to dive at you with a sweeping slice, and then a final aerial attack to stab his sword into the ground.\n\nWhile his projectile bones unleashed from his arm now come in two waves instead of one, he has a much more dangerous projectile attack that happens when he makes a very loud crowing noise.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
