Your light combo attack comes in four sustained attacks, culminating in a strong overhead slam when performed uninterrupted.\n\nDefeating each of them will earn you a fair bit of Experience - seen by the yellow bar in the top right corner, as well as a bit of “**Will** ”, which serves as a form of currency. Given that you’ll need both to succeed in your adventure, it’s usually best to take on enemies you encounter rather than running past them.\"\n            - Following Text: \"A voice will call out as you defeat the first two enemies, and we’ll be meeting the owner of this voice soon enough.
