An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n## Village Entrance\n\nThe Xu Dog as he’s known has a problem he needs help with: A large frog has swallowed one of his medicinal formulas, and you’re just the person he’s looking for to get it back.\n\n\nHeading to the left of the lone shack, you’ll find a gate guarded by a Rat Governor and another Archer on the rooftops that connects to the one you climbed earlier. Defeat them to gain access to a large open field inside the Village’s main area. From across the field, a voice pleading to be freed calls out, but in your way is a large loping creature that will want to engage you first.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Earth Wolf\n\nBe sure to open up the gate nearby to unlock a shortcut back to the Village Entrance. As an added bonus, all the Rat Archers posted on the gate’s roof have jumped down, and you can ambush the entire group. Your Sage’s Relic should now indicate an enemy who has a Spirit you can absorb, and sure enough you can spot a tougher Rat Archer than the rest with blue flames. Defeat him, and you’ll be able to absorb the Rat Archer Spirit. As an added bonus, all the Rat Archers will no longer spawn here!\"\n            - Following Text: \"Since they’re all gone, head through the gate the archers were guarding and stick to the right side to find a path up to a chest, which you can loot to get 1 **Small Piece of Gold** and 3 **Tiny Piece of Gold**.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
