His most basic attack will begin when he draws his arm in before lashing out with a straight jab with his long claws. Ignore the urge to retaliate, and instead wait a moment for him to follow-up with an incorporeal backhand followed by a blazing palm strike.\n\nYou'll have two options to counter this move: by dodging the third and final strike, you can use this time to capitalize on the end of his combo with Immobilize or Spirit Attacks to send him stumbling.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once you've learned the timing of his combo, you can also perform a Rock Solid Deflection on his second strike even when he's incorporeal, and the deflection will knock him backward and out of his transparent form, allowing you to press your attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
