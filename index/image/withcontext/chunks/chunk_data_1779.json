Combat in Black Myth: Wukong can be quite the challenge, so picking up all of the Awaken Wine Worms to get the most out of your healing is essential.\n\nAwaken Wine Worms can be rather difficult to find but are always contained in pots with a golden glow spilling out from underneath the lid. Here, we have the locations of all Awaken Wine Worms so you can collect any you may have missed along your travels.\n\nYou can use your Awaken Wine Worms at the Monkey's cave in the Marsh of the White Mist.\n\n* Black Wind Cave Awaken Wine Worm\n* Marsh of the White Mist Awaken Wine Worms\n* Yellow Wind Ridge Awaken Wine Worm\n* Outside the Pagoda Awaken Wine Worm\n* Longevity Road Awaken Wine Worm\n* The Estate of the Zhu Awaken Wine Worm\n* Temple of the Yellow Flowers Awaken Wine Worm\n* Purple Cloud Mountain Awaken Wine Worm\n* Rakshasa Palace Awaken Wine Worm\n* Bishui Cave Awaken Wine Worm\n\n\nThe Awaken Wine Worm in Chapter 1 is hidden in a temple guarded by the Black Wind King. After defeating the boss, head to the left side of the temple and break the pots to uncover your first Awaken Wine Worm.\n\n\nOnce you reach Chapter 3, you can revisit the Monkey at his cave in the Marsh of the White Mist and purchase more Awaken Wine Worms from him.\n\n## Yellow Wind Ridge Awaken Wine Worm\n\nThe Awaken Wine Worm in Chapter 2 is in a small shack just above the area where you will fight the First Prince of Flowing Sands. You can see the glowing vase from outside the shack, but you will need to drop down and follow the path to the left to get behind the wall and smash the vase.\n\n\nHead back toward the Pagoda after activating the Outside the Pagoda Keeper's Shrine and take a right. Run to the end of the area on the right to open the chest and drop off the side of the cliff to the floor below. Turn left and fight your way to a small alcove, where you will encounter the Blade Monk Spirit. Defeat the Spirit and break the barrel it was guarding to collect the Awaken Wine Worm.\n\n### Longevity Road Awaken Wine Worm\"\n            - Following Text: \"Head through the gate beside the Longevity Road Keeper's Shrine and into the stone-paved clearing.
