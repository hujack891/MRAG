Head straight ahead from the Outside the Forest Keeper's Shrine and over the bridge to find the clearing on the right.\n\n## Wandering Wight Fight\n\nWandering Wight has a series of extremely hard-hitting attacks, and he's not afraid to use them. Some of these attacks can potentially one-shot you, so learning how to recognize and dodge them will make the fight much easier. Here are the attacks you can expect to see from Wandering Wight:\n\n* Ground Pound Attack (this attack has a massive aftershock that rips the surrounding ground up)\n* Ground Smash\n* Swipe Attack\n* Stomp Attack\"\n            - Following Text: \"Wandering Wight's swipe and stomp attacks are easy enough to avoid with the right timing. The ground pound moves, however, are the most dangerous tricks he has up his sleeves. The aftershocks that tear up the ground after those attacks can destroy you just as easily as they do the arena. The best way to combat those aftershocks is to run away and get as much distance between you and Wandering Wight as possible before the ground fractures.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
