On the plus side, many of the Worm Practitioners are lying out in the sun and won't react until you get close, so you can either ignore them, or sneak up to hit them with charge attacks before finishing them off.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Whether you want to kill every last one or not, be sure to at least clear out the far left side of the lower pathway first, and behind a tree you can find the final **Meditation Spot** for this temple area.
