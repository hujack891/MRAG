An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n## Village Entrance\n\nThe Xu Dog as he’s known has a problem he needs help with: A large frog has swallowed one of his medicinal formulas, and you’re just the person he’s looking for to get it back.\n\n\nHeading to the left of the lone shack, you’ll find a gate guarded by a Rat Governor and another Archer on the rooftops that connects to the one you climbed earlier. Defeat them to gain access to a large open field inside the Village’s main area. From across the field, a voice pleading to be freed calls out, but in your way is a large loping creature that will want to engage you first.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Earth Wolf\n\nIf you see the boss angle its head and raise its arm up, be ready for a shoulder charge dash as it slides along the ground to try and tackle you. Stick to dodging away and to the side and wait until the tackle is done to get in your counters.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Though it can often rise up on its hind legs to slash at you with its front claws, certain times its wild swings will make it crash forward to land belly up. After a moment it will thrash around and try to damage you if close, but with an exposed unarmored part of its body, you can try freezing it in place and expending a charged attack - preferably with the Smash or Pillar Style to slam down on its ribs for extra damage.\n\nYou can also get an opportune strike after dodging its grab by using that moment to hit it hard with a Spirit attack from the Wandering Wight, and big enough hits can cause it to fall on its belly as well.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.

Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
