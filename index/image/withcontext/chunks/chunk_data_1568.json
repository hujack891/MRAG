It also has poison to shoot in your direction and a couple of worms that emerge from egg sacs to fight alongside it. Take care of the worms first, so you have fewer enemies to deal with at once and take some Antimiasma Powder to cure yourself of poisoning if it gets too bad.\n\n## Puppet Spider Spirit\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Venom Claw**\n* Equipped Effect: Moderately slows the decay of Might.\n\nThe Puppet Spider's Spirit allows you to take the form of the spider and use its long fangs to slice and dice your enemies. Sadly, this move doesn't inflict any poison damage, but it can still be very handy in battle. The equipped effect is also pretty good, slowing down the decay of Might so you can use your Transformations for longer.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
