Instead use your Cloud Step to get around and sneak attack.\n\n\nRealizing the error of his ways, the Man-in-Stone will promptly burrow right back in the ground and plead for mercy. You’ll then be able to re-harvest the Stone Essence from him, which will turn into the **Azure Dust Transformation Spell**! Finally, the slow yet sturdy power of the Rock Guai is yours to command in battle!\n\nUnlike the Red Waves wolf transformation, you’ll be extremely slow, unable to dodge, and overall be a pretty big target. On the plus side, you’ll be immune to all status effects while transformed, and deal incredible damage that staggers most enemies. Instead of Might building on attack, you’ll build it while taking damage, allowing you to soak blows and unleash a powerful jump attack spell in return!\n\nAs an added bonus, if you keep hassling the Man-in-Stone, he’ll promise to prepare wares to sell the next time you visit. Be sure to take him up on this offer, as he’ll have a decent selection of (very high-priced) goods!\n\nMan-in-Stone's Shop\n| Man-in-Stone's Shop                | Man-in-Stone's Shop           |\n| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| Blood of the Iron Bull - 3280 Will | Gold Ridge Beast - 12800 Will |\n| Iron Pellet - 6480 Will            |                               |\n| Goldflora Hairpin - 12800 Will     |                               |\n| Sobering Stone - 6480 Will         |                               |\n\n## Rockrest Flat\n\nUp the stairs, a Spearbone with shield guards a spot with a large waterfall of sand. The Spearbone is tougher than average, because defeating him will allow you to claim the Spearbone Spirit to add to your arsenal of transformation attacks! Just beware of his roar that preludes a frenzied combo of spear swings and slams, and use your Immobilize or Cloud Step to skirt around his defenses and attack him instead of his shield.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Taking a closer look at the sandfall behind this enemy, you’ll find that its actually a magic barrier that can be dispelled, but only if you were able to crack the wall near the First Prince of Flowing Sand and find the Loong Scales. Once you have them, you’ll be able to interact with the sandfall and remove it, opening a door to a very tough secret boss fight - the Black Loong. Due to its difficulty, and some ways to make the fight easier you’ll unlock later, we recommend saving him for later.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
