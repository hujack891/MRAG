There are two phases to this intense battle inside the pit of Zhu Bajie's stomach.\n\n\nYou need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Look for the golden tree near where you saw the Feng-Tail General and Water-Wood Beast.\n\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n\n## Emerald-Armed Mantis Boss Fight and Guide\n\nAlong with these attacks, the mantis will sometimes fly up and start to slash its blades, but send out projectiles instead. Its combos will become more agile, and it will often spin around again and again with its blades creating circles around it.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Transformations are also useful here, and we found that Red Tides proved handy once again. The mantis is susceptible to burn damage, so it will chip away at its health bar while you follow up with attacks.\n\nWhen the mantis is dead, you'll receive Dian-Cui Loong-Soaring Bracers. With all the main bosses finished, for now, it's time to follow Zhu Bajie up the mountain. On the way though, there are just two more optional bosses to capture to wrap up this portion of the Chapter.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
