Pluck them all, and you'll find the one in the center is actually a boss!\n\n### Old Ginseng Guai Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nThey behave much in the same way as regular Ginsenglings do, moving slightly faster than the boss, which can help you lure them away from his attacks. Prioritize taking them out first so you don't get blindsided later, and try the Ashen Slumber transformation spell to detonate yourself near them, or use Spirit Attacks with wide reaches.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Stick to staying in safe spots to keep using Thrust Stance out of the range of his roots, or Pillar Stance above him, and look for his many openings when he tumbles to the ground to press the attack, and he'll fall before long, granting you both the **Old Ginseng Guai Spirit** , Millenium Ginseng Seeds to give to Chen Loong, and the **Ginseng Cape** to wear.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
