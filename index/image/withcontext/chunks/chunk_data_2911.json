He's the final boss of the Chapter, so expect a challenging fight.\n\n\nThis fight will begin immediately after finishing the fight against Red Boy.\n\n## Yaksha King Boss Fight and Guide\n\nIn the second part of the fight, he'll become much more aggressive. This will also be when Zhu Bajie leaves the fight. He won't only swing the blade around himself like he did in the first portion of the fight, but he'll also swing the sword overhead and land it down in front of him. When he does this, he'll send out a trail of the grass-like blades. You can dodge the long arcs in the same way you did for the first part of the fight, and dodge side to side to avoid the trail of blades.\"\n            - Following Text: \"There's one particular attack in this second half of the fight where he'll charge at you. You'll need to dodge this, otherwise, he'll grab you and a short cutscene will begin. The Yaksha King will pummel The Destined One, and when you restart the fight, you'll see a significant chunk of your health gone.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
