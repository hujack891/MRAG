You’ll also meet the owner of the voice on the wind - the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain.\n\nThis friendly guy will be your guide and mentor for this part of the world, and will bid you to set out in search of Guanyin Temple, which burned down long ago but has since been rebuilt - but not by human hands. As the Keeper departs, he’ll bestow you with the Incense Trail Talisman, which can let you warp back to the last Shrine you rested at.\n\n\nOpposite the balcony, you can spot some torches marking a tunnel passage into the rocks. Delve inside to find a familiar golden trail leading to the next Shrine. Now that you’ve grown, so to has the Shrine’s options, as you’ll be able to set Spells to your quickbar, reset your Skill Tree if you wish to experiment, and start buying and selling things at the store:\n\nBlack Wind Mountain Shrine Store\n| Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store          | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store    | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store  | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store |\n| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| Evil Repelling Medicament (x3) - 270 Will | Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Antimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will |                                  |\n| Yarn (x4) - 300 Will                      | Stone Spirit (x4) - 450 Will        |                                   |                                  |\n| Aged Ginseng (x5) - 90 Will               | Purple Lingzhi (x5) - 90 Will       | Gentian (x5) - 90 Will            | Jade Lotus (x5) - 90 Will        |\n| Snake-Head Mushroom (x5) - 120 Will       |                                     |                                   |                                  |\n\nSince you can’t craft medicine yet, you probably don’t need to be buying ingredients, but the medicines offered here are fairly rare to find in this chapter, so it won’t hurt to buy a few of each, and then sell any Pieces of Gold you’ve found.\n\n## Outside the Forest\n\nAs you begin to leave the Shrine, the Keeper will stop and warn you of the dangers to come in this next area, and opt to give you a way to do some scouting first.\"\n            - Following Text: \"You’ll be transformed into a small Golden Cicada, which will allow you to fly around the next area to get a look at the dangers to come before you face them yourself. However, your flight time will be limited by the meter slowly fading in the bottom left, and whenever you run out of juice (or manually de-transform) you may find yourself in hot water, so how much you actually want to explore in this form is up to you.\n\nThe main path through is area is a very straightforward one, as you can simply follow the straight path past the first two Wolf guards near the Shrine, to a axe-wielding Wolf Stalwart by a small bridge over a stream, and then straight through a tunnel that’s guarded by an extremely tough (and very optional) mini-boss with a giant head.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
