Located in the center of the Crouching Tiger Temple, this fearsome Tiger Guai is one of the hardest bosses to overcome in all of Chapter 2.\n\n* **Rewards:** Rock Solid Spell, Keeness of Tiger, Mind Core x1, Silk x3, 1652 Experience, 1362 Will\n\n\nYou can find him inside the Crouching Tiger Temple, which is located at the end of the Sandgate Village, taking a left after defeating the King of Flowing Sands and through a crack in the wall in the Valley of Despair.\n\n## Tiger Vanguard Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThis leaping twisting fist slam attack can even come with little warning, as he’ll sometimes yell out while crouching before charging you and jumping into the move.\n\nHe may also abandon his martial arts stance to quickly dive to the side, and then pounce on you to follow up with two quick downward punches, and a heavy stomp afterwards. Don’t expect much room to fight back during this one unless you can Immobilize or get a charged strike ready to knock him off-balance.\"\n            - Following Text: \"One major trick the Tiger Vanguard has up his sleeve is the power to turn to stone. He’ll try and bait you into this when spreading his arms wide or crouching down, but try not to take the bait, and use the time to heal, use consumables, or ready a Transformation.\n\nAt the start, attacking him will prompt him to soak the blow and retaliate with a large punch when he comes out of his stone form. This time can be much better spent charging up your own heavy attack to hit him with the moment he comes out of the form and shakes off the dust.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
