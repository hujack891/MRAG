Instead use your Cloud Step to get around and sneak attack.\n\n\nRealizing the error of his ways, the Man-in-Stone will promptly burrow right back in the ground and plead for mercy. You’ll then be able to re-harvest the Stone Essence from him, which will turn into the **Azure Dust Transformation Spell**! Finally, the slow yet sturdy power of the Rock Guai is yours to command in battle!\n\nUnlike the Red Waves wolf transformation, you’ll be extremely slow, unable to dodge, and overall be a pretty big target. On the plus side, you’ll be immune to all status effects while transformed, and deal incredible damage that staggers most enemies. Instead of Might building on attack, you’ll build it while taking damage, allowing you to soak blows and unleash a powerful jump attack spell in return!\n\nAs an added bonus, if you keep hassling the Man-in-Stone, he’ll promise to prepare wares to sell the next time you visit. Be sure to take him up on this offer, as he’ll have a decent selection of (very high-priced) goods!\n\nMan-in-Stone's Shop\n| Man-in-Stone's Shop                | Man-in-Stone's Shop           |\n| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| Blood of the Iron Bull - 3280 Will | Gold Ridge Beast - 12800 Will |\n| Iron Pellet - 6480 Will            |                               |\n| Goldflora Hairpin - 12800 Will     |                               |\n| Sobering Stone - 6480 Will         |                               |\n\n\nJust past this final Buddha statue head, look through the archway opening in the rocky wall. Ahead you’ll spot a group of stone floating in the air, signaling your next boss fight is at hand. There's also a strange large rock to the left - make a note of it and we'll inspect it later.\n\n\nYou can also try transforming into the Rock Guai yourself with the Azure Dust. Just remember that you only build Might by getting hit, and the slow pace of his attacks may make that hard unless he’s going for his more rapid arm stamping attack. If you do get a full Might bar, you can unleash a devastating “Rockfall” attack that will take off a good deal of this bosses health bar!\n\nDefeating the Stone Vanguard will reward you with the Sterness of Stone, one half of the items you need to activate the tallies that unlock the large door to the chapter’s main boss.\n\nNote - This arena is actually home to more than one boss, and it’s hiding in plain sight. Near the entrance you came in through the large archway, there’s a large stone on the side, and on closer inspection has many heads carved into it. Draw close, and you’ll be able to interact with it, inserting the six Buddha Eyeballs you gained from the statue heads around the Fright Cliff. Doing so will unlock the Shigandang secret boss battle. It’s a much tougher fight than the Stone Vanguard, and we recommend saving it for the tail end of this chapter, either after you’ve cleared it or are close to doing so.\n\n## Rock Clash Platform\"\n            - Following Text: \"Just beyond the arena where you fought the Stone Vanguard, you can find a new Shrine to rest at. Defeating the Stone Vanguard will unlock a new armor set to craft: The Galeguard Set, which will grant you certain bonuses when utilizing Perfect Dodges.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
