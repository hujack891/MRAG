This Yaoguai Chief is sent to block your progress into the Valley of Ecstasy, but you'll need to fight him twice to defeat this foe.\n\n* **Rewards:** Non-White Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Cold Iron Leaves x2, Random Materials, 1847 Experience, 1188 Will\n\n\nIf you've got a good idea of his attack patterns, using the Smash Stance's varied combo to \"see through\" his attacks can be extremely useful to power through his slices to hit him while he's unable to defend, and the follow-up heavystrike you can unlock usually can't be blocked by him either.\n\nThe good news is once you've taken out half of his real health bar (not his sword's defense bar), he'll break off the attack and retreat. The bad news is you haven't seen the last of him.\n\nContinue taking the path up the cliffs to reach a large open area with an archway at the far end leading to a huge valley, and on the right you'll find Non-White at a Meditation Spot waiting for round two.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-White (Round Two)\n\nHe'll now also swap his stance to pivot and look back at you over his shoulder, before leaping over with a quick slash and then jumping up to hang in the air a moment as his blade charges before making an extremely fast dash across the room with his frost sword.\n\nSince you'll need to fully defeat him this round, it's more than likely that you'll end up smashing through the defense from his weapon and removing the bar entirely. Unfortunately, this isn't necessarily a good thing.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Non-White will quickly perform his own type of Cloud Step to evade you and retreat, replacing his longer frozen sword with two smaller poison blades, and will have a whole new attack set during this temporary phase. While it does mean he can no longer block you until his frost blade regenerates, you'll need to be wary of taking too much poison damage.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
