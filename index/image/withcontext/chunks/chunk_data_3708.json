Focused on dodging and deflecting attacks to then follow those actions up with powerful attacks, Ebon Flow can easily be missed within The New West as it is a part of a long quest chain.\n\nThe spell allows you to transform into the Yin Tiger to ward off incoming blows by holding the sword horizontally, or dashing forward like a gale to close in on foes. Focus is then built up before transformation can be converted for use afterward. Ebon Flow's moveset is as follows:\n\n* **Light attack: Onslaught Blade - Raise the Great Iron Blade to strike the target, building up focus with each hit.** As Focus increases, enemies are more easily staggered with this series of attacks that raises your Great Iron Blade.\n* **Heavy attack: Rift Cleaver - Hold Heavy Attack to unleash a powerful cleave, deling massive damage.** The more Focus built up, the more devastating the damage becomes with this attack, which is a slow, powerful slam.\n* **Deflection: Blacksmith - Raise the blade to deflect assaults, build up Focus with each deflection, or dodge to switch to other moves.** This is one of the only defensive moves a Transformation Spell has, building Focus with each hit and allowing you to mitigate damage.\n\n## **Black Myth: Wukong Ebon Flow Location**\n\nDefeat him using our Chen Loong boss guide. Once defeated, he will become friendly and you will be able to talk to him. He will ask you for some medicine to help him. This can be obtained from Xu Dog by just talking with him back at the Cellar Shrine in the Crouching Tiger Temple. With it, you can then return to Chen Loong, who will give you Ruyi Scroll, teleporting you to the Zodiac Village.\n\nIn the Zodiac Village, you can talk to Yin Tiger, who is a blacksmith sitting amongst the other merchants.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Upon talking to Yin Tiger, you can choose to have a duel, which starts a boss battle. Our breakdown of the Yin Tiger boss has a detailed overview of the moves to watch out for and tips to succeed. If you are successful at taking down Yin Tiger, you will obtain the Ebon Flow Transformation.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
