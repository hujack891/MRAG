Clear out the foes, and then open it to find a **Copper Pill** Soak for your Gourd. This one in particular has an impressive effect to negate the cost of Rock Solid when used soon after using the gourd.\n\n\nOpen the large gate the Rat Imperial Guard were posted at, and head through to the other side. Be sure to look to the right as you open the gate, and you’ll find a tree with glowing flowers on it. Gather the **Luojia Fragrant Vine** , and be sure to return to the Shen Monkey later to improve your Gourd when you can!\n\nWatch out for another Lingzhiling in disguise nearby from the fragrant vine, and then travel up the path (check a small cave on the left for a green Wisp) and up to the Windrest Hamlet Shrine.\n\n\nShould you manage to best him in combat, he’ll offer to help you unlock this “Realm of Gold”, and open the doorway up the stairs that will lead you to another memory - a Secret Area known as the **Kingdom of Sahali**.\n\nWe highly recommend checking this place out before taking on the Chapter 2 Boss, as much like Chapter 1, its reward can greatly help you in that battle, and you’ll also find a Meditation Spot in this secret area!\n\n\nThe only other path leads directly into the heart of the black tornado that dominates the landscape, so when you’re ready to face the final boss of this chapter, head on in!\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Yellow Wind Sage\n\nHe can also do a very quick jab with the butt of his trident that comes after the end of the weapon glows for a moment, and he’ll soon follow it with a stomp that’ll be hard to dodge if staggered by the first attack. If you spot the other end of his spear glowing, you should have enough time to parry it with Rock Solid when he jabs, and interrupt his follow up attack!\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once you’ve carved out around a third of the Yellow Wind Sage’s health bar, things will get a little more scary. He’ll suddenly toss the head into the sky, and begin to sweep his spear around him to create a giant sandstorm — the power of the Samahdi Winds. Stay very clear of his repeated swings when this happens, as he’ll end the move with a giant whirling spin attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
