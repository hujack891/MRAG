The winged creature is the first boss you'll encounter in the Chapter, as The Destined One makes the climb to the top of the mountain.\n\n## How to Find the Supreme Celestial Inspector\n\nMake your way into the center of the clearing, where Bajie will exclaim it's a dead end. However, you'll soon be joined by the Supreme Celestial Inspector. If you found all of the Purple Talismans in Chapter 4, then this will be a familiar face to you.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Supreme Inspector\n\nThe Supreme Inspector will use two types of elemental attacks in this fight, which are thunder and fire. In the first third of the fight, it will mainly use thunder attacks, so you'll want to have plenty of Shock-Quelling Powder with you and equip any gear or curios that give you extra resistance to shock. Fire will be introduced in the second portion of the fight, so you'll also want Body-Cooling Powder, and the final part will be a combination of the two elements.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Though it might seem tempting to equip the Fireproof Mantle, we'd recommend using the Plantain Fan, which will be able to help you in the second phase of this fight.\n\nThe first thing to note as you start the fight is that the Supreme Inspector will use its wings like a pair of arms. It will lunge and punch at you, so you'll need to learn the timings of its wing attacks.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.

Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
