An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n\nNow it’s time to finally open that door the Rat Captains were guarding. In the next scene, you’ll spot the next major boss fight: a tiny Rat King and his oversized son.\n\n\nAnother terrifying new move is for him to do a slow spin ending with a weapon toss right at you. He’ll quickly follow up with a leaping dive attack to reach his mace, and then pull it out of the ground and swing it forth, which should quell any thoughts of trying to attack at this point.\n\nIdeally, the lower you have his health before killing his father, the less time you’ll have to worry about this phase if you can rush him down. If you don’t kill his dad, he’ll scurry off as soon as the Second Prince falls. If not, you’ll be able to help yourself to the Second Prince’s Spirit, as well as a Pungent Flesh Chunk.\n\n## Valley of Despair\n\nOn the other end of the tunnel, the path will open up into a large interior valley with the sun streaming down on the left. Stick to the right side for now, and you’ll find a large door that can’t be opened from this side.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Just past the door, you can find a wooden structure built into the rock walls with a glowing pot just out of reach. To get to it, look for a ledge below you can drop down onto, and take the path right to climb back up. Break the glowing pot to gain your second **Awaken Wine Worm** to upgrade your Gourd’s Drink. Just remember you can only do so by traveling back to the Shen Monkey in Chapter 1.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
