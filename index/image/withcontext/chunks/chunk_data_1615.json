Hidden away in the Forest of Wolves, you won't be able to encounter this boss until you obtain a Key Item later in the game, and this boss is and appropriate challenging fight far stronger than anything else in Black Wind Mountain. Red Loong is one of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n\n* **Rewards:** Boshan Censer, Thunder Tail, Loong Pearl x1, Mind Core x1, Silk x3, 1652 Experience, 1376 Will\n\n\nYou can now find a spot to interact with in front of the large waterfall, using the power of Loong Scales to evaporate the waterfall, and reveal a path to the Red Loong Dragon.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Battle - Red Loong\n\nThe Red Loong is a fearsome red dragon imbued with the power of electricity, which is both his greatest strength and weakness once you know how to exploit it. It’s important to note that while you can face this boss once you find the required Key Item early in Chapter 2, you may want to wait until after completing Chapter 2, or even starting Chapter 3, due to the difficulty of this encounter. In particular, it’s a good idea to stock up on medicine to increase your shock resistance, and buy the Thunderbolt Horn Soak from the Shen Monkey as well.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Red Loong will use its electricity imbued attacks to wreak havoc on you, but can also perform a variety of powerful melee attacks.
