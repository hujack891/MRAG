It has a different style of perk compared to the other Gourds in the game, built for those who enjoy fast-movement-based builds. Unfortunately, with only 7 uses, it can't be upgraded at the Shen Monkey Vendor.\n\nWith the Gourd equipped, your drinking speed is massively increased - a huge boon for those who enjoy fast-paced builds and like to be in the thick of the action. It is less strong if you are a player who prefers playing slower and not attacking constantly. One of the other Gourds in the game will be a better choice.\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Stained Jade Gourd Location\n\nThe Stained Jade Gourd can be found in The Webbed Hollow, within the secret area: Purple Cloud Mountain upon defeating The Scorpionlord. You must kill the boss before defeating [ The Duskveil in this area, as it will lock Purple Cloud Mountain off. To reach this area, you will need to defeat the Venom Doaist twice within The Webbed Hollow.\n\nThis video guide will help you out with those initial steps:\n\nAs The Scorpionlord is optional, you will want to keep to the right from the area's first Shrine. Here you will find the Bounds of Deity's Abode Shrine. Up the stairs, The Scorpionlord can be found drinking on the top of a building. Rile him up by destroying some of the pots to initiate the fight.\n\nRemember, if you want the Stained Jade Gourd, you need to defeat him before completing the area and defeating The Duskveil.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Our page on The Scorpionlord boss fight has a bunch of tips to help you defeat him.\n\nFor even more guides and tips on finding all the Gourd customisation items, be sure to check out our other guides.
