Responsible for the \"beguiling chant\" that curses you in the Pagoda Realm, you can find this boss inside the Mani Wheel at the top of the prison.\n\n* **Rewards:** Spirit of Captain Wise-Voice, Mind Core\n\n## Where to Find Captain Wise-Voice\n\nCaptain Wise-Voice is one of the four captains you can find in Chapter 3, and is a required boss to escape the prison of the Pagoda Realm. You can reach him by escaping up through the four levels of the Pagoda Prison and past the Outside the Wheel Shrine.\n\n### Captain Wise-Voice Boss Fight and Guide\n\nOnce enough damage has been sustained to its leg, you'll see its leg start to explode with light, meaning your attacks have successfully staggered the boss. He'll fall to the ground in a heap, with its sphere-like core right in front of you.\"\n            - Following Text: \"This is your best chance to get in some real damage, but it's worth noting that a big charged heavy strike can sometimes knock it completely out of its dazed state. Instead, build up some more focus with one or two light combos, and then expend all your focus points on a bit charged hit to end its daze, taking off a huge amount of health in the process.\n\nRepeat the process of damaging its leg, or look for any opportunities to strike at its head -- particularly when it triggers the beguiling chant again to take off a chunk of your maximum HP.\n\nHowever, you'll also need to be ready to deal with its one major attack, which usually comes after you've assaulted its sphere at least once.\n\nAt a certain point, the construct will step into a corner of the room while the sphere lifts up and float high up toward the center, spinning wildly. It will send out beams of electricity in all direction as it twirls around, and the music swells.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
