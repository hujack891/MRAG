The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Fungiwoman\n\nThe Fungiwoman behaves almost identically to the Fungiman you fight fought in the Pagoda Realm (and a few times after), only they'll have a bit more health, and deal a bit more damage, but you should know what to expect for most of their attacks. Though they have a boss healthbar, they aren't tracked in your journal for Yaoguai Chief entries.\n\nWhen they rise out of their hiding spot, they'll flood the immediate area with poison, and can do so multiple times, so always be ready to back off when you see noxious fumes billowing up and swap to Thrust Stance.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The Fungiwoman can also expel toxic strands from its side to seek you out, but can thankfully by swept aside with a staff spin. The same can also happen if they slam their staff down, creating geysers that spawn additional projectiles.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
