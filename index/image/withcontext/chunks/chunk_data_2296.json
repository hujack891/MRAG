Below you'll find a guide for the Valley of Ecstasy Region, including how to reach the valley itself by defeating Non-White, and exploring the different parts of the valley to uncover several Yaoguai Chiefs on the path to the New Thunderclap Temple, and completing the Treasure Hunter's Quest and the Pagoda Realm Prisoner's Quest by defeating the final Captain.\n\n- **Jump to a Section:**\n- **Mindfulness Cliff**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White (Round Two)\n- **Forest of Felicity**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- **Brook of Bliss**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Able\n- **Towers of Karma**\n- Yauoguai Chief - Old Ginseng Guai\n- **Longevity Road**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Captain Kalpa-Wave\n\nAfter you solved the monk's riddle by praying at four Buddha Statues in the Precept Corridor, you'll split up from Zhu Bajie and make your way into the belly button of a large Buddha statue along the cliffs, taking you up a narrow pathway and into the Mindfulness Cliff.\n\n\nFrom the Shrine, you'll find yourself at the edge of a large pit with a pathway spiraling around its edge.\n\nHowever, as you begin to head up the path around the pit, you'll be interrupted by the arrival of a jester-like figure who wants to wear your face.\n\n\nContinue taking the path back outside and up the cliffs to reach a large open area with an archway at the far end leading to a huge valley, and on the right you'll find Non-White at a Meditation Spot waiting for round two.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-White (Round Two)\n\nIf you don't deflect, be ready for him to turn around after the charge and launch a barrage of poison daggers in your direction that are much harder to get out of the way of if you aren't ready to start strafing.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Another dangerous attack that can be hard to follow will start with him moving erratically in his mist form to close the distance to you, and start with a spinning slash attack. As the momentum carries him in a circle, he'll return to face you by spewing poison in your face. Since it's a ranged attack you won't be able to deflect this one, but you can dodge to the side while sprays straight ahead.\n\nWhen he crouches down while crossing his blades, he'll leap over for a low jump attack with both daggers, followed by two delayed swings of his poisoned weapons, and ending with a quick uppercut attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
