Like before, much of their attack patterns will follow the basic enemy, so there won't be too much of a surprise in store.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Much of the worm's moves rely on stumbling and staggering slashes with their long poisonous appendage, either thrusting forward or dragging it along the ground toward you.
