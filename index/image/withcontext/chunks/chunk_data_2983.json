Hiding across several rope bridges outside the middle of the Webbed Hollow, this boss can't be activated until you obtain a Key Item in the previous chapter. Yellow Loong is the final of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n\n* Rewards: Golden Lining Transformation Spell, Sea-Supporting Tendon, Golden Carp Curio, Kun Steel, Loong Pearl, Mind Core, 6998 Experience, 5049 Will\n\n\nYou can enter the crack in the wall, and on the other side you’ll find a chest containing the Loong Scales. With this item, you’ll be able to unlock the boss.\n\n## Yellow Loong Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe easiest way to do so is to immediately trigger the Wind Tamer Vessel you get from Chapter 2's Secret area the second you see him charge up. The blast will immediately stun him, and he will be unable to complete the charge (the downside is you usually only have enough Qi to use it once, and he's known to employ this move multiple times).\n\nIf you have 3 focus points already banked, you can also quickly unleash a charged strike with the Thrust Stance to stagger him out of, but your reaction speed will need to be very quick.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The other way to stop him is to let him charge up, but then immediately shift into Rock Solid the second he releases the blast and flies at you for his initial swipe. It's this attack and this one only that will completely knock the wind out of him, and stop him from performing the rest of his dive-bombs and slams, which will not stagger him if you try deflecting those.\n\nEven outside this new attack of his, the last half of the fight will be even deadlier as he follows up many of his basic attacks with more sweeps and spins than before.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
