That way, you can fight without worrying about your health constantly depleting.\n\nYou can find the Xiang River Goddess Gourd in the chest-filled chamber you pass through on your way to fight the Elder Armourworm in the Webbed Hollow.\n\nThe Flint Chief fights like a combination of the Flint Vanguard and the other large, glowing rock enemies around the Valley. It does have appendages that it uses to kick or swipe at you, but most of its attacks will be delivered via the creature's huge, lava-infused head. These attacks hit hard, but since the Flint Chief is big, it's also rather slow, giving you enough time to dodge.\n\nImmobilize or A Pluck of Many speeds up the fight significantly if you don't have the Gourd yet.\n\n## Flint Chief Spirit\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Solid Stance**\n* Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Four Banes Resistance.\n\nThe Flint Chief's Spirit allows you to turn into a solid rock to avoid taking damage from enemy attacks. This is similar to the Rock Solid spell, but it doesn't stagger the enemy when timed correctly as Rock Solid does. It still deflects damage, though, which is the main drawcard of this Spirit. The equipped effect is also defensive, increasing your resistance to all Four Banes. This makes it a versatile Spirit to channel in the Webbed Hollow, the New West, and the Flaming Mountains.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
