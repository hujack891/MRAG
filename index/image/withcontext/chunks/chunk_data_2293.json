Below you'll find a guide for the Valley of Ecstasy Region, including how to reach the valley itself by defeating Non-White, and exploring the different parts of the valley to uncover several Yaoguai Chiefs on the path to the New Thunderclap Temple, and completing the Treasure Hunter's Quest and the Pagoda Realm Prisoner's Quest by defeating the final Captain.\n\n- **Jump to a Section:**\n- **Mindfulness Cliff**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White (Round Two)\n- **Forest of Felicity**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- **Brook of Bliss**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Able\n- **Towers of Karma**\n- Yauoguai Chief - Old Ginseng Guai\n- **Longevity Road**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Captain Kalpa-Wave\n\nAfter you solved the monk's riddle by praying at four Buddha Statues in the Precept Corridor, you'll split up from Zhu Bajie and make your way into the belly button of a large Buddha statue along the cliffs, taking you up a narrow pathway and into the Mindfulness Cliff.\n\n\nFrom the Shrine, you'll find yourself at the edge of a large pit with a pathway spiraling around its edge.\n\nHowever, as you begin to head up the path around the pit, you'll be interrupted by the arrival of a jester-like figure who wants to wear your face.\n\n\nContinue taking the path back outside and up the cliffs to reach a large open area with an archway at the far end leading to a huge valley, and on the right you'll find Non-White at a Meditation Spot waiting for round two.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-White (Round Two)\n\nHe'll now also swap his stance to pivot and look back at you over his shoulder, before leaping over with a quick slash and then jumping up to hang in the air a moment as his blade charges before making an extremely fast dash across the room with his frost sword.\n\nSince you'll need to fully defeat him this round, it's more than likely that you'll end up smashing through the defense from his weapon and removing the bar entirely. Unfortunately, this isn't necessarily a good thing.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Non-White will quickly perform his own type of Cloud Step to evade you and retreat, replacing his longer frozen sword with two smaller poison blades, and will have a whole new attack set during this temporary phase. While it does mean he can no longer block you until his frost blade regenerates, you'll need to be wary of taking too much poison damage.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
