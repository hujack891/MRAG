Located along the main path through the Bamboo Grove, this boss is a ranged fighter who moves quickly to evade you while filling you with poison strikes.\n\n* **Rewards:** Guangmou Spirit, Materials, 700 Experience, 520 Will\n\n## Where to Find Guangmou\n\nFollow the main path across the bridge from the Shrine and down to a stream, and follow it into a large bamboo forest patrolled by snakes. On the opposite side of the circular forest, you can spot two small statues forming an entrance into the grove where Guagnmou lurks.\n\n### Guangmou Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nGuangmou is one of the more tricky fights you’ll have faced so far, relying on a variety of sneaky projectile attacks to keep you on the defensive and limit your ability to pursue him. Though he’s not technically a snake, you will find yourself in danger of being poisoned during this fight, so you may want to buy a few anti-poison medicine from the Shrine’s shop.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He’ll almost always begin the fight by summoning a cluster of homing ghostly projectiles that burst out of him before tracking you down. You can avoid the group by dodging to the side, or holding down your staff spin until they’ve been deflected.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
