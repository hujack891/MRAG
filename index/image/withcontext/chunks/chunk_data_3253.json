Below you'll find a guide to accessing the kingdom of the past by undertaking the Drunk Boar's Questline to find a Sobering Stone, and how to defeat the Tiger Vanguard and secret Yaoguai King Boss, Fuban.\n\n* Jump to a Section:\n* **How to Access the Kingdom of Sahali**\n- Yaoguai Chief - \"Tiger Vanguard\"\n* **Sandgate Bound**\n- Yaoguai King - Fuban\n\nThis Chapter 2 Secret can only be accessed by meeting the Yellow-Robed Square in Fright Cliff (aka the Drunken Boar), and helping him in his search for the \"Realm of Gold\" which requires a few steps (and for you to best him in combat).\n\n\nOnce you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into the Kingdom of Sahali\n\n\nAs you round the corner, you’ll be told to halt by the defender of a large gate: A slightly familiar looking Tiger Guai who calls himself the Vanguard of the Yellow Wind King. If he looks familiar to another Vanguard you’ve faced, that’s because he’s actually the other Vanguard’s father! He’ll ask that you turn around and head home, which seems like such a waste with all you’ve gone through just to get here.\n\n\nUpon defeat, you’ll gain the **Tiger Tally** curio, and he’ll realize your prowess and invite you to meet his king.\n\n\nThe yellow-furred rat is at an impasse, as the scarab’s magic is preventing him from engaging the monster directly. This is where you come on. The Yellow Rat Sage will agree to pound the drums to force the scarab to the surface, allowing you to engage the behemoth directly and find whatever vessel is giving it its power.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Fuban\n\nOther attacks can include swipes with both hands that sweep side to side, so even if one hand swipes past, don’t get too confident in thinking the danger has passed in case another claw on the other side sweeps your way.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Fuban can also rear back on its hind legs before slamming down to create a large shockwave, and will require a well-timed dodge, or you can turn into stone form to soak the blow.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3.
