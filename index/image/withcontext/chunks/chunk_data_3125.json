Responsible for sealing captives in the cells of the Pagoda Realm, you can find this boss in a secret chamber within the Pagoda Prison.\n\n* **Rewards:** Spirit of Captain Lotus-Vision, Frostsprout Twig, Mind Core, Cold Iron Leaves, 1847 Experience, 1198 Will\n\n## Where to Find Captain Lotus-Vision\n\nCaptain Lotus-Vision is one of the four captains you can find in Chapter 3, and is an optional Yaoguai Chief you can encounter in the Pagoda Realm.\n\nTo find him, you'll need to reach the Upper Pagoda Shrine on the third level of the prison. Just behind the shrine, there is a pit with purple light emanating below that you can drop into and find this boss.\n\n### Captain Lotus-Vision Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nYou'll find find Captain Lotus-Vision in front of a large group of kneeling corpses, which he can randomly imbue with magic to create a Withered Corpse that will come to life and attack you. These are nothing more than a distraction, but should still be dealt with immediately so they don't hamstring you later.\n\nLuckily, he'll get rid of all the corpses later in the fight, and they won't respawn for future attempts.\n\nMuch of this boss's power comes from a purple crystal mounted on the tip of a staff he carries against his shoulder, which will expend a variety of projectile attacks. Some will be easier to anticipate than others, but you'll always want to keep that crystal in view.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Early on, basic attacks will include a large circle of projectiles that expel from the crystal before arcing toward you. Other times, it will expel a trio of projectiles in three short bursts before they track you down in waves.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.

Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
