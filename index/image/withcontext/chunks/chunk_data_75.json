As an optional foe, you can seek out this boss just past the Sandgate Village in a large valley cave, and will need to defeat him to unlock more than one secret boss.\n\n* Rewards: Arhat Hold Piece, Silk x2, Yarn x2, 1102 Experience, 1020 Will\n\n## Where to Find First Prince of Flowing Sands\n\nIf you did kill the King (and made his Second Son very angry), you'll have gained a Pungent Flesh Chunk Key Item from defeating the duo. This item can be used at the very edge of the valley's cliff to summon the First Prince himself.\n\n\nIf you try dodging around and attacking from the side, be aware that he can either use a quick tail swipe to stagger you, or swing his arm back quickly to draw you away from flanking him, so don’t get too comfortable.\n\nEven as big as he is with a larger health pool, he’s not as ferocious as the enraged Second Prince. Do note however there is a **secret trick in this fight** : If you lure him into doing one of his larger slam attacks while your back is to the curved wall, his strikes may cause the wall to crack - revealing a secret!\n\nOnce he’s been defeated, he’ll drop the **Arhat Gold Piece** Key Item. We'll need it for a sidequest elsewhere in this chapter.\n\n### The Loong’s Secret Tomb\nIf you got lucky, the First Prince’s attacks may have formed a giant crack in the slightly rounded wall full of little statues on the side of the boss arena, forming a hole you can slide through. If you weren’t able to trigger this, don't worry. You can crack the wall yourself, but it will require a major attack, much bigger than your little monkey frame can deal out. However, specific transformations will get the job done - like the Wandering Wight’s Spirit headbutt attack, or the Azure Dust transformation spell found elsewhere in this chapter.\"\n            - Following Text: \"On the other side of the crack, you’ll enter a large tomb with a chest by a mural. It holds the Loong Scale - a very important object that allows you to access several secret bosses!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
