Hiding on the far side of Turtle Island this frozen boss can't be activated until you obtain a Key Item in the previous chapter. Cyan Loong is one of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n\n* Rewards: Tridacna Pendant, Thunderbone, Loong Pearl x1, Refined Iron Sand x2, Mind Core x1\n\n## Where to Find Cyan Loong\n\nOnce you arrive in the large covered valley area, keep to the left to find a large lower platform by a slightly rounded red wall lined with small statues. At this point, if you did not kill the King of Flowing Sand, he’ll summon his other son, the First Rat Prince — otherwise you can use the Pungent Flesh Chunk to summon him yourself.\"\n            - Following Text: \"While fighting the First Rat Prince, you can lure him into performing one of his large slam attacks when facing the rounded wall, and it will cause a crack to appear in the wall. If you are unable to lure the boss into forming a crack in the wall, you can even do so yourself by hitting it with a very strong attack - we recommend the Wandering Wight’s Spirit Attack, or the Azure Dust Transformation Spell’s final attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
