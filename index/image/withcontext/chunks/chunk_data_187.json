Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby.\n\n\nAs you get close to the edge of the cliff, you'll find another clearing with a rock in the middle. This is the third Poison Chief in the region.\n\nWhen you've beaten the third Poison Chief, head over to the start of the red trees. As you enter the clearing with the lightning, you'll find the next Keeper's Shrine on the left.\n\n\nWhen it's defeated, head back along the river and look for the golden tree.\n\n## Mantis-Catching Swamp\n\nNow that you've cleaned up the majority of the optional bosses, it's time to find the last of the main bosses. You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis.\n\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n\n\nFrom the Mantis-Catching Swamp, fly up and back toward the area where you fought the Gold Armored Rhino and Cloudtreading Deer. We now want to stop on the left, to get the Son of Stones, which is the boss sitting at the edge of the cliff on the left with the neon blue glow.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Son of Stones\n\nWhen he gets back up, use the Plantain Fan to stagger him and remove the lightning attacks and then folow up.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When the Sone of Stones is down, there's just one more boss to take care of, which is a secret Yoaguai King. To be able to summon it, you'll need to have collected the Skandhas through the previous Chapters. If you haven't already got your hands on these Skandhas, follow our guide to collecting them all here.\n\nGo to the clearing behind where you fought the Son of Stones, just off to the left. You'll see some water, a large rock to the left of it, and two golden trees on either side of the rock.\n\nYou want to go to the right of the water to find the secret area that will take you to the hidden boss.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
