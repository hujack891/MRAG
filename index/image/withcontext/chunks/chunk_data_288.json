Instead use your Cloud Step to get around and sneak attack.\n\n## Squall Hideout\n\n\nThe large cave entrance has a few paths, with the outer one on the right leading past another Pitstone to a wooden coffin chest holding 3 **Silk** and some **Will**.\n\n\nStart by luring the shieldless Spearbone out of range of the Blazebones above, then climb the stairs to rush down the projectile throwers. Be sure to look at the ruined home at the first landing below the first Blazebone for a yellow chest that has 2 **Yaoguai Core** and 3 **Tiny Piece of Gold**.\n\n\nAt the end of the crevice, you’ll find an unusual looking stone. He’s actually a Man-in-Stone, and claims to have been trapped within the rock form. He’s betting on one of the rock guai in the large cave nearby to hold the secrets to reversing his fate, and asks you to seek it out.\n\n### The Fourth Buddha’s Eyeball\"\n            - Following Text: \"As you leave the crevice with the Man-in-Stone, stick to the left wall going up to find several paths leading toward the large cave. Halfway up this sloping path just above where the Man-in-Stone is in the crevice below, you’ll find another of the large stone heads chanting, and can claim it’s Buddha’s Eyeball.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
