Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration.\n\n## Valley Entrance\n\nUltimately, you're going to go left to continue on the main path (and you may start to hear characters talk as you approach this pillar), but for now, you'll want to detour and explore the area to the right.\n\nThe first thing you'll see as you go to the right is the Flamlings that sit in the lava. These will spit fire at you, so it's best to deal with them to remove the ranged attacks while you explore.\n\n### A Note on Flamlings\n\nWhen you reach the lava, go to the dark corner on the right to collect the green Wisp. As you approach, you'll be jumped by Scorching-Fire rocks, so be prepared. Then, go up the ramp on the left to meet another Earth Rakshasa and take this out.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Head through the archway, where you'll see another Flamling emerge on the right.
