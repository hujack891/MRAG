You’ll also meet the owner of the voice on the wind - the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain.\n\nThis friendly guy will be your guide and mentor for this part of the world, and will bid you to set out in search of Guanyin Temple, which burned down long ago but has since been rebuilt - but not by human hands. As the Keeper departs, he’ll bestow you with the Incense Trail Talisman, which can let you warp back to the last Shrine you rested at.\n\n\nOpposite the balcony, you can spot some torches marking a tunnel passage into the rocks. Delve inside to find a familiar golden trail leading to the next Shrine. Now that you’ve grown, so to has the Shrine’s options, as you’ll be able to set Spells to your quickbar, reset your Skill Tree if you wish to experiment, and start buying and selling things at the store:\n\nBlack Wind Mountain Shrine Store\n| Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store          | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store    | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store  | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store |\n| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| Evil Repelling Medicament (x3) - 270 Will | Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Antimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will |                                  |\n| Yarn (x4) - 300 Will                      | Stone Spirit (x4) - 450 Will        |                                   |                                  |\n| Aged Ginseng (x5) - 90 Will               | Purple Lingzhi (x5) - 90 Will       | Gentian (x5) - 90 Will            | Jade Lotus (x5) - 90 Will        |\n| Snake-Head Mushroom (x5) - 120 Will       |                                     |                                   |                                  |\n\nSince you can’t craft medicine yet, you probably don’t need to be buying ingredients, but the medicines offered here are fairly rare to find in this chapter, so it won’t hurt to buy a few of each, and then sell any Pieces of Gold you’ve found.\n\n## Outside the Forest\n\nThe far side of the stream has many more materials to collect, and most importantly, a path leading from the bridge where the archer was to a small archway where another extremely important yet optional mini-boss awaits you.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Guangzhi\n\nAnother quick moving attack has a lengthy start up, as he’ll keep somersaulting backward and leaping to build up momentum, jumping high and pausing in the air before slamming forward with weapon blazing. If you have the Pillar Style unlocked, you can actually hold your Heavy Attack button to lift yourself off the ground and avoid the attack entirely! He’ll waste time twirling his blade after this strike, making it a good time to get your own hits in.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Remember to apply your Immobilize spell when it serves you best — interrupting his charged up attacks or after a combo when he’s not up in the air so you can lay into him, and use it whenever the spell recharges. With enough damage dealt, the boss will fall, leaving his weapon embedded in the ground nearby.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
