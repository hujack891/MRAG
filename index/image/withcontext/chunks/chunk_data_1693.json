An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n\nNow it’s time to finally open that door the Rat Captains were guarding. In the next scene, you’ll spot the next major boss fight: a tiny Rat King and his oversized son.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n\nThis usually ends with a quick wave of force as he pulls his weapon up that you’ll need to dodge, so don’t get too gutsy trying to retaliate early on this attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If you hear him start to yell at a distance, be prepared for a charge attack that comes with a three hit smashing sweep attack, and wait until his final attack to retaliate with your own combo attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
