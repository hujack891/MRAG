Go right from The Purifying Spring Keeper's Choice and up the stairs and through the gap in the wall. Follow this path along to the right, and cross the bridge. Then turn left and look for the white sacs that block a path going down. Smash through these and go down here to find a Buddha head, where the monkey from previous chapters will be sitting. Once the monkey has run off, take the Skandha of Choice from the Buddha's head.\n\n\n* How to Find Yellow Loong\n\n\n* How to Find All Purple Talisman Altars in Chapter 4\n\n\n* How to Unlock the Chapter 4 Secret Area\n\n\nWe've listed the secret bosses in Purple Cloud Mountain in a particular order because players have reported that this is a missable encounter. For that reason, we'd recommend tackling the Scorpionlord first when you're in Purple Cloud Mountain.\n\n## Daoist Mi and the Snake Lady - Purple Cloud Mountain\"\n            - Following Text: \"As you begin to follow the path in Purple Cloud Mountain, you'll encounter a weeping snake curled around a tree. To help her out, you need to find the Daoist Mi, who waits near the Petalfall Hamlet. He'll ask you to find Violet Hail for him, which you can obtain from the yellow-robed enemies in the area. Once you have it, Daoist Mi will become a boss with two phases.\n\n### Don't Miss This Boss!\n\nJust like The Scorpionlord, you won't be able to fight Daoist Mi if you head straight for The Duskveil. We'd recommend tackling him second, as you make you way up to Cloudnest Peak.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
