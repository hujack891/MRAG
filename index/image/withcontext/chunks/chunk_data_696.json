Accessing this one involves an NPC questline, so here's everything you need to know from how to find the drunken boar that will get you into the Kingdom of Sahali.\n\n**Jump to:**\n\n* How to Find the Yellow-Robed Squire (Drunken Boar NPC)\n* How to Get the Sobering Stone Method 1\n* How to Get the Sobering Stone Method 2\n* Take the Sobering Stone to the Yellow-Robed Squire\n* How to Find the Boar at Crouching Tiger Temple\n* How to Find the Boar After the Crouching Tiger Temple\n\n\nTo the right, there's a set of stairs leading up to the sandfall. On the left, you'll find the entrance to an arena where you can fight the Stone Vanguard. If you go straight ahead, however, you'll see a small pathway that looks like it's blocked by a wooden fence.\n\nSmash through the fence and go straight ahead to find the Yellow-Robed Squire on the rock. Unfortunately, you won't get much out of him except for retching and mentions of jars from Windrest until you find a **key itemcalled the Sobering Stone**. There are two ways to get hold of the item, so here's what you need to know.\n\n\nAs you step into the next courtyard, turn to the left. You'll see a building with a broken wall. Head towards the gap here, and you'll find a glowing pot with the Sobering Stone in it.\n\n\nFor a detailed walkthrough of the area and how to find both the Man-in-Stone and the Mother of Stones boss, see our Fright Cliff walkthrough.\n\nGiving him the Stone Essence will result in you needing to attack him. But once you've shown him who's boss, he'll turn into a merchant. The Sobering Stone costs 6,480 Will from him.\n\n\nOnce you have the Sobering Stone, bring it back to the Yellow-Robed Squire in Rockrest Flat. Once you've given the boar the stone, he'll move on to the Crouching Tiger Temple.\n\n\nFrom the Temple Entrance Keeper's Shrine, head up the stairs and take the turning on the right just before you reach the top. You'll see the Yellow-Robed Squire slouched against the wall. When you speak to him he'll ask you for a treat of a **Jade Lotus**. If you don't have any of these, look for areas where there's water. You just need one; when you have it, bring it back to him and he'll move on from the Crouching Tiger Temple.\n\n## How to Find the Boar After the Crouching Tiger Temple\n\nInstead, look to the slope on the right when you first enter the area, to see him standing waiting. Approach him, and he won't be too happy about you having the gold piece, sparking a duel between the two of you.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Beating him will reward you with the Snout Mask headgear piece, but you'll also be able to go into the door that's at the top of the slope here. Entering this will trigger a cutscene and you'll be transported to the Kingdom of Sahali.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
