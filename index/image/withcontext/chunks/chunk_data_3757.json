You'll need to complete all chapters' secret areas and an elusive side quest before you can find this tough boss.\n\n\nThere are several steps you need to take to unlock Mount Mei. You can find a detailed breakdown on our dedicated page: How to Unlock the Secret Ending (True Ending). But here's a quick rundown of everything you'll need to do by Chapter 6 to reach it.\n\n1. Complete the Chapter 1 secret area of the Ancient Guanyin Temple\n2. Complete the Chapter 2 secret area of the Kingdom of Sahali\n3. Complete the Green-Capped Martialist/Treasure Hunter quest in Chapter 3\n4. Complete the Chapter 4 secret area of the Purple Cloud Mountain\n5. Complete the Chapter 5 secret area of Bishui Cave\n6. Return to **The Great Pagoda in Chapter 3**. You can find it on the Snow-Veiled Trail in the Pagoda Realm.\n\n\nWhen you’re in The Great Pagoda, you’ll see tapestries around the room. One tapestry, at the very top of the room, will be red. Head for this, and a cutscene will begin where the small Buddha from Chapter 3 will be waiting for you. He'll open the tapestry and let you into Mount Mei.\n\nWhen you're through the tapestry, head up the stairs and follow the path. About halfway up you'll need to shimmy across a ledge on the left to reach the other side, then you'll continue up to the Mei-Jian Peak Keeper's Shrine. At the top of the peak is where you'll find Erlang, The Sacred Divinity.\n\n## Erlang, The Sacred Divinity Boss Fight and Guide\n\nWhen the second stage begins, he'll fly up in the air and a giant axe will appear. This will swing and eventually crash down but can be dodged quite easily. The attack doesn't end here, however, as Erlang quickly follows up with his own attack to try and catch you off guard. This will send out a ripple that looks like ice, that you'll need to roll over or jump to avoid.\"\n            - Following Text: \"From this phase onward, you will have to deal with lighting from Erlang, so Shock-Quelling Powder and resistance to shock attacks are a huge help here.\n\nThe second stage is a series of combo attacks, where he'll use his staff and swap between a small version of the axe or a sword. When he has the sword, you can expect projectiles to follow. These can be blocked by spinning your sword or dodging.\n\nThe problem with this stage is getting the timings right, as his attacks can often seem delayed from when they feel like they should end. If you're using Spells, do not try to use Immobilize until his shield is down again. You'll want to keep hitting him and use Cloudstep to build up your Focus, then whittle his shield down or use the Plantain Fan to do it, if you can get it back quickly. All other Spells aren't worth wasting your Mana on.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
