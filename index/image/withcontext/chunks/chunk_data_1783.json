After being rescued, he will offer a variety of services to improve your healing Gourd, as well as selling new items as you progress through the game.\n\n\nHeading down the path from the shrine, you’ll encounter a Snake Patroller harassing a monkey hanging from a ceiling, and requesting your aid. Defeat the snake, and the **Shen Monkey** will offer his thanks, and usher you into a nearby cave where he resides.\n\n## Shen Monkey Upgrades and Shop\"\n            - Following Text: \"Talking to the Shen Monkey in his cave, you’ll find that he’s a merchant of gourds, drinks, and brews! Be sure to check all of his options out:\n\n* **Upgrade Gourds** \\- By using the  Luojia Fragrant Vine you just found by the nearby Shrine, you upgrade the charges in your **Old Gourd** from 4 swigs to 5, turning into a Medicine Gourd, and giving you more uses of its healing properties.\n* **Upgrade Drinks** \\- The default drink stored in your healing Gourd is **Coconut Wine** , which restores a third of your health for each swig. Once you find Awaken Wine Worms, return to him and you’ll be able to upgrade the amount healed with each use!\n* **Brew** \\- With your equipped Drink, you can enhance it by adding a Soak to increase additional effects beyond the heal. You can try it out now by adding the **Gall Gem** , which will increase your poison resistance in addition to the heal from your Gourd.\n* Store - If the Gall Gem isn’t all that enticing, be sure to check his shop, as the Shen Monkey also sells items. He’ll only sell an **alternate Soak** to start with, but will upgrade his stock as your advance through new chapters.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
