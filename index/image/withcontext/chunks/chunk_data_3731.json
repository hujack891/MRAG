Located in a secret realm locked away in the past, you'll need to activate three bells in order to locate and defeat him.\n\n* **Rewards:** Fireproof Mantle, 2,000 Will\n\n\n* **Bamboo Grove** \\- Traveling through the very short region of the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll have to defeat a character boss, the Whiteclad Noble. Once he retreats, look for a path off to the left instead of heading straight into Black Wind Cave, and you’ll find a large plaza past the marsh where several Wolf Guai sit before a wolf that has been hung from a tree. Just beyond them is the final bell.\n\nNote - Before facing this boss, be sure to defeat the optional **Wandering Wight** that is found in the Forest of Wolves region of Black Wind Mountain if you haven’t faced him already. Not only does he share many attacks with this secret boss, but defeating this one will cause the Wandering Wight to disappear, and you will not be able to gain the Curio and Spirit that the Wight drops.\n\n## Elder Jinchi Fight and Guide\n\nOnce Elder Jinchi reaches around half of his health, he’ll suddenly teleport away, reappearing in the middle of the arena and adopting a praying pose hovering too far up to reliably reach. All of the shambling bodies in the arena will be removed, but it’s when they start to reappear that you’ll need to be ready.\n\nIn this segment, the bodies will slowly walk toward Jinchi in the middle of the arena, appearing slowly at first, but soon swarming from all sides. If any of them reach a spot close to the center, they’ll be absorbed by Jinchi giving him part of his health bar back.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The only thing you can do is beat Jinchi to the punch. Start sprinting around the arena the moment you spot a body, and use a single attack to defeat them and steal their health instead. You’ll have to race back and forth, so conserve your stamina by only using quick attacks before getting back to sprinting.\n\nOnce enough have been absorbed by either you or him, he’ll return to the ground and the fight will resume.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.

Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
