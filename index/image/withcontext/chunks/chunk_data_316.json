Instead use your Cloud Step to get around and sneak attack.\n\n\nRealizing the error of his ways, the Man-in-Stone will promptly burrow right back in the ground and plead for mercy. You’ll then be able to re-harvest the Stone Essence from him, which will turn into the **Azure Dust Transformation Spell**! Finally, the slow yet sturdy power of the Rock Guai is yours to command in battle!\n\nUnlike the Red Waves wolf transformation, you’ll be extremely slow, unable to dodge, and overall be a pretty big target. On the plus side, you’ll be immune to all status effects while transformed, and deal incredible damage that staggers most enemies. Instead of Might building on attack, you’ll build it while taking damage, allowing you to soak blows and unleash a powerful jump attack spell in return!\n\nAs an added bonus, if you keep hassling the Man-in-Stone, he’ll promise to prepare wares to sell the next time you visit. Be sure to take him up on this offer, as he’ll have a decent selection of (very high-priced) goods!\n\nMan-in-Stone's Shop\n| Man-in-Stone's Shop                | Man-in-Stone's Shop           |\n| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| Blood of the Iron Bull - 3280 Will | Gold Ridge Beast - 12800 Will |\n| Iron Pellet - 6480 Will            |                               |\n| Goldflora Hairpin - 12800 Will     |                               |\n| Sobering Stone - 6480 Will         |                               |\n\n\nJust past this final Buddha statue head, look through the archway opening in the rocky wall. Ahead you’ll spot a group of stone floating in the air, signaling your next boss fight is at hand. There's also a strange large rock to the left - make a note of it and we'll inspect it later.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Stone Vanguard\n\n### Secret - Get Help from the Shigandang\"\n            - Following Text: \"If you find yourself having trouble with the Stone Vanguard, it is possible to get some assistance from the most unlikely source: Another Yaoguai King found in the same boss arena.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
