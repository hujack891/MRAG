He's the final boss of the Chapter, so expect a challenging fight.\n\n\nThis fight will begin immediately after finishing the fight against Red Boy.\n\n## Yaksha King Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe Yaksha King will draw two blades from his elbows, which will be angled behind him for the fight. These will glow brightly, and he'll use them traditionally as blades, but also be able to throw our circular projectiles from them.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Zhu Bajie will be helping you out at the start of this fight, so you can use him as a distraction while you get some hits in. It's also wise to try and hold off on healing as much as you can and allow Zhu Bajie to do this for you instead.\n\nWhen the Yaksha King begins to throw out those circular projectiles, you'll find that these often are around 4-5 at a time. It's best to dodge them by rolling forward, toward the Yaksha King, so you can immediately attack as the last one is dashed.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
