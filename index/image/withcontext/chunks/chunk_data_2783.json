Below you'll find a guide for the first upper area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find your first encounter with the Venom Daoist, and the different ways to reach The Verdure Bridge.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Upper Hollow**\n* **Pool of Shattered Jade**\n- Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nBefore following the golden trail of a nearby Shrine, look to the left of the bed and small chest to find a path leading to another larger **Treasure Chest** you can open to claim a **Cuo Jin-Yin Belt Hook Curio** , another item that can help resist all the poison you'll be encountering.\n\n\nYou'll now find yourself on the opposite side of the Hollow from where you first started, with a group of platforms in front of you that offer a one-way ticket down to the start of the Middle Hollow and the Verdure Bridge. However, going down there now would cause to a miss a large optional area complete with a boss (but you can drop down early to grab the Shrine and warp back up if you want).\n\n\nCarefully carve a path through the Clawed Cocoons to reach the other side, and you'll find yourself in a large chamber with an even bigger cocoon hanging down from the middle. Something angry is muttering to itself inside, and its apparently waiting for you.\n\n## Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nTo commence the fight against the Venom Daoist, you'll need to bat the Odd Cocoon around like a pinata for awhile, until about half of its health bar is gone. Once your attack gets bounced away, the Venom Daoist will emerge, sporting two swords and eight arms to tear you apart.\n\nIn reality, the Venom Daoist isn't the toughest opponent you've faced, but the low lighting will make it a little hard to see his attacks in his tangle of arms. Once you learn his positioning for his various attacks, you'll find plenty of opportunities to get in some of your own.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The Venom Daoist usually starts with his most basic attack, holding both swords to his side, and then springing forward with a dual slash on your right. He'll quickly follow up by rolling over to stab at the ground, and then after a moment leap into the air to slam down on top of you.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
