Located in a secret realm locked away in the past, you'll need to activate three bells in order to locate and defeat him.\n\n* **Rewards:** Fireproof Mantle, 2,000 Will\n\n\n* **Bamboo Grove** \\- Traveling through the very short region of the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll have to defeat a character boss, the Whiteclad Noble. Once he retreats, look for a path off to the left instead of heading straight into Black Wind Cave, and you’ll find a large plaza past the marsh where several Wolf Guai sit before a wolf that has been hung from a tree. Just beyond them is the final bell.\n\nNote - Before facing this boss, be sure to defeat the optional **Wandering Wight** that is found in the Forest of Wolves region of Black Wind Mountain if you haven’t faced him already. Not only does he share many attacks with this secret boss, but defeating this one will cause the Wandering Wight to disappear, and you will not be able to gain the Curio and Spirit that the Wight drops.\n\n## Elder Jinchi Fight and Guide\n\nAfter losing a bit of his health, the Elder Jinchi will get mad, often proclaiming you’ve stolen some treasure from him, and command his followers to attack. Now, finally, the shambling bodies will finally become a threat, and begin to glow as they chase you.\n\nThe good news is they don’t move all that fast, and must stop for a moment before finally exploding. All you need to do is lead them on a merry chase, and zigzag around to cause them to begin to explode before dashing away. Once no more glowing zombies are near you, resume your fight against Jinchi.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once Elder Jinchi reaches around half of his health, he’ll suddenly teleport away, reappearing in the middle of the arena and adopting a praying pose hovering too far up to reliably reach. All of the shambling bodies in the arena will be removed, but it’s when they start to reappear that you’ll need to be ready.\n\nIn this segment, the bodies will slowly walk toward Jinchi in the middle of the arena, appearing slowly at first, but soon swarming from all sides. If any of them reach a spot close to the center, they’ll be absorbed by Jinchi giving him part of his health bar back.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.

Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
