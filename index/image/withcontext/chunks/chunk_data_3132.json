Responsible for sealing captives in the cells of the Pagoda Realm, you can find this boss in a secret chamber within the Pagoda Prison.\n\n* **Rewards:** Spirit of Captain Lotus-Vision, Frostsprout Twig, Mind Core, Cold Iron Leaves, 1847 Experience, 1198 Will\n\n## Where to Find Captain Lotus-Vision\n\nCaptain Lotus-Vision is one of the four captains you can find in Chapter 3, and is an optional Yaoguai Chief you can encounter in the Pagoda Realm.\n\nTo find him, you'll need to reach the Upper Pagoda Shrine on the third level of the prison. Just behind the shrine, there is a pit with purple light emanating below that you can drop into and find this boss.\n\n### Captain Lotus-Vision Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nBecause of the difficulty of this section (and that you may also be at half health from the chanting curse), we highly recommend using Cloud Step so at your decoy can draw fire for a large portion of this attack.\n\nAfter the four circles all emit their laser blasts, they'll float away from Captain Lotus-Vision to take up spots in each corner of the room. Each circle will emit a continuous laser that borders the room, and will slowly pan them around to cross over the floor and each other.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Dodging them will be extremely difficult, so instead swap to your Pillar Stance and extend off the floor (preferably in range of the Captain) and start charging up as you evade the floor lasers. Once they perform a second sweep, launch your attack the captain.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
