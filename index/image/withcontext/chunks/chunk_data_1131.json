Unfortunately, though, summoning the Mother of Flamlings also summons several other Flamlings who will hurl fireballs at you throughout the entire fight.\n\nMake your way around the arena, picking off the Flamlings so you can focus on the Mother. Continue dodging around the Mother while slashing away to wear down her HP bar and eventually defeat the Mother of Flamlings. If you're struggling with this battle, some Body-Cooling Powder will help with any Burn Damage you might be incurring.\n\n## Mother of Flamlings Spirit\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Flamling Queen**\n* Equipped Effect: Moderately reduces the Cooldown for all Spells.\n\nThe Mother of Flamling's Spirit allows you to summon two Flamlings of your own to fight alongside you. These Flamlings can not only deal damage to your enemies but also steal their attention so you can sneak up on them and land some surprise attacks while they're not looking. The equipped effect is excellent, reducing the cooldown of all Spells so you can cast more spells in total.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
