Though he is not found along the main path through the Black Wind Mountain, defeating him will earn you an extremely useful Transformation Spell that should not be missed.\n\n* **Rewards:** Red Tide Transformation Spell, Stone Spirit x1, 700 Experience, 528 Will\n\n\nPick up the fiery blade, and you’ll learn a Transformation Spell: **Red Tides**. Now you’ll be able to transform into the very boss you defeated, and use his own abilities in combat against your enemies.\n\nTransformation Spells are very powerful, and essentially give you a separate health and might bar to work with. Might will decay fairly quickly over time, and even more if you charge up the transformation’s focus bar to employ special spell attacks. For this particular spell, you’ll be able to use Guangzhi’s spinning light attacks, and charge a heavy attack for his quick dashes. With a full focus bar, you can use Might on spell after dodging to employ his powerful pogo jump attack!\n\n## Black Wind Mountain’s Secret - Ringing the First Bell\"\n            - Following Text: \"With Guangzhi defeated, you can look where he was meditating to find a large bell. Interact with the pole to ring the bell. The Keeper will fret over this, but in reality this is the first of three bells you should seek out in Chapter 1 to uncover a major secret!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
