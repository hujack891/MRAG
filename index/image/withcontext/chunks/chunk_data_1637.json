An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n## Yellow Wind Ridge\n\nWhen you regain control, head into the stagnant shallow pool of water, where you’ll find a few Jade Lotus to harvest. Over on the right, the source of the arrows you became riddled with will become apparent, as a nearby ridge is lined with Rat Archers who will fire long salvos of flaming arrows from above.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Sprint past them along the water until you can find a small area to climb up onto, where a Rat Soldier will engage you from the left. Be sure to strafe around to keep the archers between you and the soldier, and bait out his shield slam before hitting him with a heavy attack to shatter his shield (the shield’s health appears as a white bar above his health bar).\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
