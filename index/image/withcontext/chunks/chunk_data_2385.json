Below you'll find a guide for the Valley of Ecstasy Region, including how to reach the valley itself by defeating Non-White, and exploring the different parts of the valley to uncover several Yaoguai Chiefs on the path to the New Thunderclap Temple, and completing the Treasure Hunter's Quest and the Pagoda Realm Prisoner's Quest by defeating the final Captain.\n\n- **Jump to a Section:**\n- **Mindfulness Cliff**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White (Round Two)\n- **Forest of Felicity**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- **Brook of Bliss**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Able\n- **Towers of Karma**\n- Yauoguai Chief - Old Ginseng Guai\n- **Longevity Road**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Captain Kalpa-Wave\n\nAfter you solved the monk's riddle by praying at four Buddha Statues in the Precept Corridor, you'll split up from Zhu Bajie and make your way into the belly button of a large Buddha statue along the cliffs, taking you up a narrow pathway and into the Mindfulness Cliff.\n\n\nFrom the Shrine, you'll find yourself at the edge of a large pit with a pathway spiraling around its edge.\n\nHowever, as you begin to head up the path around the pit, you'll be interrupted by the arrival of a jester-like figure who wants to wear your face.\n\n\nContinue taking the path back outside and up the cliffs to reach a large open area with an archway at the far end leading to a huge valley, and on the right you'll find Non-White at a Meditation Spot waiting for round two.\n\n\nBeyond this arena, you can head through an archway to see the giant titular Valley of Ecstasy below you. It's a one-way slide, and the region is about to get a whole lot bigger and confusing.\n\n\nBack at the Forest Shrine, look left from the main road to find two different passageways into a canyon. The passage before reaching the Shrine leads past a green Wisp you can absorb into a small pond where a new Frog Guai miniboss is waiting.\n\n\nSince the main path down below leads on to the Longevity Road, we'll instead head to the right side of the Forest Shrine where a hilltop is teeming with a few praying Frozen Corpses and various plants to harvest. There are two paths here -- one before the shrine, and one after the archway where the Fox Guai spoke to you, and both lead down to the next sub-region.\n\n\nJust past the crowd of Frozen Corpses, you'll find the most important thing in this region: A lone man bound and kneeling in front of a large stone pagoda on the hill above.\n\n\nThere's not much else to loot around the large stone pagoda where you fought Non-Able, so now is a good time to head back to the Forest of Felicity Shrine, and make your way through the canyon where the Frog Guai boss was to enter the next optional area.\n\n\nEventually you'll come to a much larger gate manned by two Wolf Guardians who will jump down to stop you from entering. Their attacks can come fast and overwhelming on both sides, so try to isolate one with Immobilize and focus fire the other down to take them on one at a time.\n\nBeyond this large gate lies the final sub-region leading to the New Thunderclap Temple.\n\n## Longevity Road\n\nIn the opposite direction, there's another large rock below a tower up above that you can't reach, but you can search the rock for another Lesser Apramana Bat, and nearby you can find a second **Treasure Chest** under a large tree.\n\nThe most interesting thing around here is just up the small hill past the tower. You'll find a large corpse of some kind at the base of a statue built into the cliffs ahead.\"\n            - Following Text: \"This is actually one of the four Captains that the Pagoda Realm Prisoner spoke of, but it looks like someone beat you to putting this captain out of their misery. You can still interact with the body to claim the Spirit of Captain Void-Illusion. And hey, since they still count as a Yaoguai Chief in the journal, that's one less boss to worry about!\n\nCaptain Void-Illusion\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
