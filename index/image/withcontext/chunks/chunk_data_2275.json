Below you'll find a guide for the Valley of Ecstasy Region, including how to reach the valley itself by defeating Non-White, and exploring the different parts of the valley to uncover several Yaoguai Chiefs on the path to the New Thunderclap Temple, and completing the Treasure Hunter's Quest and the Pagoda Realm Prisoner's Quest by defeating the final Captain.\n\n- **Jump to a Section:**\n- **Mindfulness Cliff**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White (Round Two)\n- **Forest of Felicity**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- **Brook of Bliss**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Able\n- **Towers of Karma**\n- Yauoguai Chief - Old Ginseng Guai\n- **Longevity Road**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Captain Kalpa-Wave\n\nAfter you solved the monk's riddle by praying at four Buddha Statues in the Precept Corridor, you'll split up from Zhu Bajie and make your way into the belly button of a large Buddha statue along the cliffs, taking you up a narrow pathway and into the Mindfulness Cliff.\n\n\nFrom the Shrine, you'll find yourself at the edge of a large pit with a pathway spiraling around its edge.\n\nHowever, as you begin to head up the path around the pit, you'll be interrupted by the arrival of a jester-like figure who wants to wear your face.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-White\n\nNon-White is a peculiar foe who attacks in haphazard fashion with his large thin blade. The most important thing to note is the smaller bar above his health bar: Non-White can use his blade to repeatedly block and parry your attacks, which can at times effectively give him a second health bar. Finding the right times to strike can be useful in circumventing his defenses, but you'll want to be wary of his frost and poison attacks. Stock up on both Antimiasma and Body-Warming medicine to deal with both scenarios should they arise.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Expect Non-White to close the distance on you rapidly, as his most common move starts with him crouching before rolling toward you, and then sliding his blade up into a jump attack for a second strike, followed by a short pause before performing a very wide swing with his frost-enchanted blade.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
