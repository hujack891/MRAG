You'll find him just inside the Warding Temple, harassing the Wise Master until you intervene.\n\nAfter a second defeat, you'll face him one last time near the end of the chapter, in-between two bouts that you'll have with the end boss, Yellowbrow.\n\n* First Encounter\n* Second Encounter\n* Final Encounter\n\n### Macaque Chief Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nIf he begins to hold the blade in both hands, prepare for an extended attack with three alternating slices ending in an upward swing with a long delay.
