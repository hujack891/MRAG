Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of The Webbed Hollow: the Village of Lanxi, as well as how to navigate the town and defeat the Second Sister.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Estate of the Zhu**\n- Yaoguai Chief - The Second Sister\n\n\nHead down the sloping street and grab a green Wisp along the way, and you'll find yourself crossing a small bridge to a clearing with a shack covered in webs. Standing our front are two Grasshopper Guai that can strike extremely quickly, but aren't as durable as the Beetle Captain.\n\nClear them out with Zhu Bajie's help, and you'll find they were guarding a large **Treasure Chest** holding several consumables, which may include a Loong Aura Amplification Pellet, as well as a Knot of Voidness and Blood of the Iron Bull.\n\n\nJust up the stairs from the Shrine is a door, so once you've made all your purchases, upgraded gear, and given the Zodiac Village another visit, you can try knocking on the door.\n\nZhu Bajie will suggest a bit of subterfuge, disguising yourselves as the Wushan Lesser Guai who were hauling the chest at the start of the chapter. You'll be met by a shrewd woman, who will immediately figure out the little pig's disguise. She happens to have a disguise of her own, and will transform into her true self.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - The Second Sister\n\nWhen she starts growling while taking a step back and shaking her body madly, that's your cue to retreat to a safe distance to avoid a spew of poison projectiles in the area in front of her.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The Second Sister also has a few unorthodox attacks that can be hard to spot, but easier to punish once you get the hang of them. One of these attacks will start as he twists her body away from you first, and then rapidly spins her body around while launching herself forward, and is better avoided than trying to deflect it.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
