As an optional foe, you can seek out this boss in the Yellow Wind Formation through one of three possible entrances to where the Chapter Boss resides behind sealed stone gates.\n\n* Rewards: Gore-Eye Daoist Spirit\n\n## Where to Find the Gore-Eye Daoist\n\nHowever, in order to open the door, you will need both the Sterness of Stone from the Stone Vanguard Boss, and Keeness of Tiger from the Tiger Vanguard Boss. With both Key Items, you'll be able to interact with the Tally in front of the door and open it, and you'll find the boss after crossing a bridge down to the Windseal Gate.\n\n### Gore-Eye Daoist Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe Gore-Eye Daoist is not like most bosses you’ve faced, what with the creepy fleshy thing on his back full of eyeballs. This boss has a specialty - and it’s creating blood. Lots of it. This blood can be pretty dangerous too, as he’ll be able to create pools of it all around the arena, and even poison you with it, so make sure you’re stocked on a few antimiasma pills.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When the fight begins, he’ll begin a loud cry, punctuated by slamming his staff into the ground that will cause several pools of blood to splash down all around him. If you’re caught in the blast, expect to be instantly poisoned, so be ready to dodge away the moment his staff slams down.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
