This Yaoguai Chief is located just below the entrance to the final boss of the New Thunderclap Temple, and can prove to be a formidable foe.\n\n* **Rewards:** Non-Pure Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Refined Iron Sand, Random Materials, 1270 Experience, 893 Will\n\n## Where to Find Non-Pure\n\nIn fact, you'll find him just to the right of the large inner courtyard leading up to the Mahavira Hall Shrine where Yellowbrow awaits. After defeating the two Dark-faced Overlords guarding the courtyard, you'll find him in a small building standing over a Meditation Spot.\n\n### Non-Pure Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nNon-Pure is a very aggressive fighter, similar to Non-Able, but instead uses a large sweeping monk spade to attack in long combo swings that can be difficult to escape from. Finding opportunities to get your own attacks in can be difficult, but you'll need to resist the urge to jump in too early or you'll be hit and staggered multiple times.\n\nGiven his long sweeping swings, having backup from A Pluck of Many or Spirits that summon other allies won't work as well as they'll tend to get hit even if he's focusing all his attention on you.\"\n            - Following Text: \"To make matters worse, Non-Pure also has a large gauntlet that he can periodically imbue with deflecting power, making him even harder to damage when he's not unleashing combos. Look for the glow in his glove (and especially his arm tattoo glowing bright as he's likely to hide his glove behind his back) to know when he's most likely to knock your attacks aside, and resist the urge to expend your focus points.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
