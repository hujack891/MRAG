Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Ashen Pass III**\n- Boss Fight - Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n* **Cooling Slope**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n- Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\n* **Fallen Furnace Crater**\n- Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n- Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\n\nAfter defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the Yin-Yang Fish, and the Crimson-Silver Cart, you'll have climbed to the top of the Flaming Mountains and be closer to finding out where the Bull King is.\n\n## Ashen Pass III\n\nBefore you continue along the path, face the Ashen Pass III Keeper's Shrine and turn to the right. You'll see a Purple Lingzhi to harvest and another mushroom in the center of the clearing. When you pull this second one, you'll be confronted by the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai, which is an optional boss.\n\n### Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n\nJust beyond the clearing where you'll fight the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai, you'll also find The Crag Meditation Spot. You can get this before or after the fight. Just before it, there's another Purple Lingzhi that can be harvested -- don't worry, this won't be another enemy.\n\nReturn to the Ashen Pass III Keeper's Shrine, and continue on the path opposite it. You'll reach a portion of the path where it narrows, and there's a Searing-Fire enemy to the right. However, the bigger problem you'll have is the spiked golden ball you can see straight up ahead.\"\n            - Following Text: \"You're about to get quite familiar with this ball, as it will follow you along the path for a while. It will roll back and forth over a small portion of the path each time, but if it hits you just once, it's game over.\n\nThe aim of this section is to find little alcoves or wider sections of the path, so you can dip into them and stay out of the ball's line of fire.\n\n**Here are some tips for completing this section:**\n\n* **Look for where the enemies are along the path.** Typically, this is where the path is wider or there's a place you can stop and wait.\n* **Watch where the ball is rolling to see where it starts and ends.** This changes as you make your way along the path, so it's always worth waiting for a second and seeing the length of the path the ball covers while it's rolling before you run.\n* **Use Cloudstep.** On the longer sections, where it seems like a mad dash to try and reach the next point, use Cloudstep to cover the ground quicker.\n* **Whenever you can, back enemies into the path of the ball.** They're not immune to the attacks, so it can make light work of them saving you the hassle.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
