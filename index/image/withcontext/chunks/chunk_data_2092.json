He'll then take to the air and slam down with his sword for a third and final strike.\n\nIf he's at a middle distance, he's much more likely to perform the same spin attack, only extending his blade instead to slash at you physically with two quick spinning slashes, and then taking to the air.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Unlike the other attack, he'll throw down his sword at you, embedding it into the ground before he lands on top of it.
