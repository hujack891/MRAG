There are two phases to this intense battle inside the pit of Zhu Bajie's stomach.\n\n\nYou need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Look for the golden tree near where you saw the Feng-Tail General and Water-Wood Beast.\n\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n\n## Emerald-Armed Mantis Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe mantis will now become quite erratic with its movements, flipping all around the stomach. Immobilize will help out with this, but so will the Plantain Fan, which will push the Mantis back to a part of the stomach and pin it there for you to attack. It will also stop it from being able to fly too much in the air.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Along with these attacks, the mantis will sometimes fly up and start to slash its blades, but send out projectiles instead.
