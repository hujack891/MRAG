Abilities cover your Foundation skills and Staff Stances, while Spells cover Mysticism, Alterations, Strand, and Transformations.\n\n## How to Understand the Early Game Skills Trees\n\nAt the beginning of the game, you’ll see that there are locked branches of the skill tree and you’ll only have access to **Foundation, Staff Stances, and Mysticism**.\n\nThe Foundation section of the skills is divided into Stamina, Martial Arts, and Survival. In these skill trees, you’ll be able to awaken abilities that will reduce your stamina consumption, increase your health, and upgrade your standard attacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Staff Stances comprise Smash Stance, Pillar Stance, and Thrust Stance, **though the latter can’t be unlocked until you reach level 20**. Smash Stance is your starting stance, and Pillar Stance can be unlocked by awakening the first node in the corresponding Skill Tree.\n\nOn the left-hand side of the Staff Stances tab, you’ll also find uncategorized skills. The ones closest to the Smash Stance set will increase your health recovery, the damage you deal, and the stamina you recover.\n\nMeanwhile, the ones on the far left will **automatically unlock** as you sink more points into Staff Stances. These will give additional Focus Points, to a total of four, and are also required for you to be able to unlock skill points from the skill tree further down.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
