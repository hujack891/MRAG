Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the grove and learning how to cultivate Spirits, accessing a secret realm, as well as how to defeat the many bosses of this area that include Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, Guangmou, and the Whiteclad Noble.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Back Hills**\n* **Snake Trail**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Guangmo\n* **Marsh of the White Mist**\n- Boss FIght - Whiteclad Noble\n\n\nTo advance, keep heading up the stairway to cross the high bridge over the falls, where you’ll soon see the golden trail of a nearby shrine beckoning you left. Before making that turn, be sure to look to the right to find a small wooden gazebo with a small table, and open the small gold box on top to find a variety of medicines, including 2 **Tiger Subduing Pellets** , 1 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 1 **Amplification Pellet**.\n\n\nAnother good strategy to note is that if you’re in danger of getting close to becoming poisoned, using the Red Tides spell can help you transform out of danger. Any status effects suffered while transformed as Guangzhi will be removed when you regain your regular health bar. As an added bonus, Guangmou will even comment on your transformation.\n\nOnce you’ve learned how to evade his projectiles, the rest of the fight will just boil down to chasing him down and stunning him however you can with Immobilize, your Spirit Attack, and other heavy hits. When he falls, you’ll gain Guangmou’s Spirit to add to your collection, allowing you to summon venomous snakes of your own!\n\n## Black Wind Mountain’s Secret - Ringing the Second Bell\n\nLook for a way forward beyond a small archway to the side of the boss arena, and climb the winding stairs to follow a trail of gold leading to the next Shrine.\n\n### Marsh of the White Mist\n\nThis next area is a fairly quick one, but it’s also very important for a few different reasons. Before moving on from the Shrine, be sure to look across from it for a tall tree with yellow flowers hanging from it, and gather the ‘’’Luojia Fragrant Vine’’’.\"\n            - Following Text: \"As you head down the path from the Shrine, you’ll come upon a lone Snake Patroller harassing a fellow monkey who is hanging from the branches above. Teach the snake a lesson by dodging his lunging bite and then finishing him off. Doing so will award you a lot of loot, including the ‘’’Gall Gem’’’, which you’ll learn more about very soon.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
