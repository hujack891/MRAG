Clear out the foes, and then open it to find a **Copper Pill** Soak for your Gourd. This one in particular has an impressive effect to negate the cost of Rock Solid when used soon after using the gourd.\n\n\nOpen the large gate the Rat Imperial Guard were posted at, and head through to the other side. Be sure to look to the right as you open the gate, and you’ll find a tree with glowing flowers on it. Gather the **Luojia Fragrant Vine** , and be sure to return to the Shen Monkey later to improve your Gourd when you can!\n\nWatch out for another Lingzhiling in disguise nearby from the fragrant vine, and then travel up the path (check a small cave on the left for a green Wisp) and up to the Windrest Hamlet Shrine.\n\n## Windrest Hamlet\n\nHead down the path around the homes, and you can find a wooden chest with 3 **Yaoguai Core** in an open area near a very long bridge leading back across the ravine toward Fright Cliff. However, a lone and imposing figure will block you as you try to cross the bridge.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Tiger’s Acolyte\n\nIf your health is dropping fast, remember you can use a Transformation Spell to rely on a secondary health bar to stay alive. Either the Red Tides or Azure Dust can work well in this fight, depending on if you want to match his agility in your wolf form, or tank his hits and then smash into him when he stops attacking. It’s also not a bad idea to try the Pluck of Many, as his smaller size makes him vulnerable to getting overwhelmed and staggered on all sides.\n\nWhen the Tiger’s Acolyte falls, he’ll drop a curious Key Item, the **Old-Rattle Drum** , as well as leaving behind the Tiger’s Acolyte Spirit to absorb. The child’s toy actually serves an important purpose to unlock another boss. You’ll need it to commune with a child’s spirit in various spots around the Yellow Wind Ridge, with the first being a short backtrack away.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Return across the bridge to the Windrest Hamlet Shrine and pass back through the large gate, immediately taking a left to the large house surrounded by sitting Withering Corpses. A visual cue will appear along with the voice of a child beckoning you, and you’ll be able to use the Rattle-Drum in front of the house. Be warned, as doing so will provoke all the nearby corpses to attack you, but you’ll also get some interesting dialogue from the child.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
