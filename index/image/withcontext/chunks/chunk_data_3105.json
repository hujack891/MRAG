As a tutorial boss, the Bullguard is designed to test your abilities in dealing with a strong foe, but you'll be helped along the way learning an important spell from the Keeper of Black Mountain.\n\n* **Rewards:** Immobilize Spell, Yarn x2, 482 Experience, 390 Will\n\n## Where to Find the Bullguard\n\nSince the Bullguard is a required miniboss, he can't be missed on your journey through the opening areas of Chapter 1. You'll find him in the Forest of Wolves, not far from the Front Hills Shrine just along the main path across a bridge, keeping to the right. The Bullguard blocks a large gate area leading to the next main region of Black Wind Mountain.\n\n### Bullguard Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nAs your first real boss encounter, you should be prepared for big hits that can take a chunk out of your health, so it’s not a bad idea to make sure you’ve rested up and refilled your healing gourd before taking him on.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The Bullguard swings a mean halberd, which he can use to perform devastating overhand slams, and much quicker horizontal slashes that swing twice before a third overhead attack. Luckily, each of these combo hits usually end with him taking a long time to pull his weapon back out of the ground and reset his positioning, which is the perfect time to strike with a light combo or sneak in a heavy attack when he’s recovering.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
