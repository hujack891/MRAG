Instead use your Cloud Step to get around and sneak attack.\n\n## Squall Hideout\n\n\nThe large cave entrance has a few paths, with the outer one on the right leading past another Pitstone to a wooden coffin chest holding 3 **Silk** and some **Will**.\n\n\nStart by luring the shieldless Spearbone out of range of the Blazebones above, then climb the stairs to rush down the projectile throwers. Be sure to look at the ruined home at the first landing below the first Blazebone for a yellow chest that has 2 **Yaoguai Core** and 3 **Tiny Piece of Gold**.\n\n\nAt the end of the crevice, you’ll find an unusual looking stone. He’s actually a Man-in-Stone, and claims to have been trapped within the rock form. He’s betting on one of the rock guai in the large cave nearby to hold the secrets to reversing his fate, and asks you to seek it out.\n\n### The Fourth Buddha’s Eyeball\n\nNear this defensive outpost is another tunnel exit, and you can step out quickly to find a Spearbone with a shield, who guards the outdoor path that connects back down to the crevice. Back in the cave, you can check the left wall to find another green Wisp to absorb, and note the golden trail of a nearby Shrine at another tunnel exit up ahead. It’s not a bad idea to activate and rest at this **Rockrest Flat Shrine** first, considering the quest we still have to finish the cave first that can be tough.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Look for the continuing cave path left of the exit that heads up a grassy slope, and collect the Fire Bellflower before you reach an open area with a Poisetone seemingly praying at an altar on the left with a green Wisp.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
