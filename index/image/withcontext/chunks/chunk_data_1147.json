With a loud gong, the trapped \"Admiral\" will use the cymbal to awaken a giant turtle whose mountainous shell you're actually standing on.\n\nAs the turtle begins to swim through the Bitter Seal, the woman will become aware of your presence, starting this new region off with a bang of a boss fight.\n\n\nAs long as your patient to wait for the right moments to get in close and attack, and make sure you're using shock-quelling medicine, you'll be able to come out on top. Even as Kang-Jin Star tries to flee in her dragon form, the Destined One will see to it that she crashes into the large cymbals, freeing the prisoner inside!\n\nThis imprisoned Pig Guai is none other than Zhu Bajie, who traveled with Sun Wukong during his adventures in Journey to the West!\n\n\nAs you start exploring the path over to the right, an echoing voice will lead you to a large open platform where dragon humanoid figure appears to be frozen in place with its fishing rod. If you interact with it while holding the Loong Scales, it will crackle to life, and begin a new secret boss fight.\n\n\nWhen he falls, you'll earn some Fine Gold Thread and another Loong Pearl, and can loot a nearby chest that appears for the Mountain-Shaking Claw material and Breath of Fire Soak for your Gourd. This new material will unlock the upgrade path for your Loongwreathe Staff into the Golden Loong Staff, but you'll need to find and defeat the last of the four Loongs to craft it.\n\nOnce you've had your fill of exploring the \"Turtle Island\", you can head to the front where the small Pig Guai stands waiting, and interact with him for the turtle to finally make its landing at the next part of the Bitter Lake.\n\n\nStart by heading along the shore and defeating various Frozen Corpses, and look for a small building in the distance by the water's edge. As you near it, you can also spot a dragon man standing alone in the shallows. Zhu Bajie seems to know him, but as you approach, you'll be pulled into another boss fight.\n\n## Boss Fight - Chen Loong\n\nReturn to Chen Loong (who now stands outside the shack by the water), and deliver the pellet to him. The old dragon will be overjoyed at your gift, and in return will pass along The Ruyi Scroll to you. He'll proclaim that he now has the strength to unseal the Painted Realm, where he and his fellow deities will now reside -- and you're invited!\n\n### The Zodiac Village of the Painted Realm\n\nOnce they've been defeated, you can approach the lone man. Zhu Bajie warns you to beware of him, but he seems harmless enough, and tells you he's in search of treasure, and promises to share it when he finds it -- though he'll likely get in trouble again before this is all through.\n\nHe'll mention part of the treasure's riddle - green without, and red within: a summer treat. Sounds tasty, so be sure to keep an eye out for something matching that description.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Before heading back to the North Shore Shrine, be sure to check the large pool of water to the left of the treasure hunter. There's a **Treasure Chest** at the foot of the pool that holds various materials, and at the far end, you can find a small rock with a Gourd Drink placed upon it: **Bluebridge Romance**!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
