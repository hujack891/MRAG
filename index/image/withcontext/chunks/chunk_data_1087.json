These Meditation Spots not only provide a beautiful place to relax and enjoy the scenery but also supply you with one free Skill Point.\n\nSome of these Meditation Spots are very well hidden. Thankfully, though, we have directions to each and every Meditation Spot in the game so you can collect all those free Skill Points.\n\nClick the links below to head straight to a particular location!\n\n| Black Myth Wukong Meditation Spots                           | Black Myth Wukong Meditation Spots                           | Black Myth Wukong Meditation Spots                           |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Black Wind Mountain | Yellow Wind Ridge | The New West |\n| The Webbed Hollow | Flaming Mountains |                                                              |\n\n\nTake the path on the left in the cave after defeating the Whiteclad Noble to find the last Meditation Spot in Chapter 1. The spot is right on the edge of the wooden platform looking out over the forest.\n\n\nThe Sandgate Bound Meditation Spot is in the secret area in Chapter 2. After defeating Fuban, explore the buildings around the perimeter of the desert area to find the last Meditation Spot. The Meditation Spot is on top of a rock on the leftmost side of the area.\n\n\nThere are two Temple structures on either side of the New Thunderclap Temple. The Hall Meditation Spot is in the Temple on the right. It is guarded by the Spirit, Non-Pure, so prepare for a fight before unlocking this Meditation Spot.\n\n## The Webbed Hollow Meditation Spots (Chapter 4)\n\nThe Webbed Hollow contains six Meditation Spots, one of which is in a secret area. Keep reading to find out where each and every one of them are.\n\n\nThis is likely the first Meditation Spot you will encounter in the Hollow. You can find it by heading up the stairs next to the first Keeper's Shrine in Upper Hollow. Shortly after reaching the top of the stairs, you will notice a platform on the left with a torch beside it. Drop down to the area below and drop down once more.\n\nFollow the path to the right through a hall of hanging webs until you reach the Pool of Shattered Jade. The Meditation Spot is in the center of the pool.\n\n\nThis Meditation Spot is directly opposite the Middle Hollow Keeper's Shrine. Head straight forward to the torches on the right to find the Meditation Spot amongst the grass on the edge of a cliff.\n\n\nTurn right and head into a crack in the wall just before you enter the Hut of Immortality grounds. Follow the path until you find a cavern filled with hanging webs. On the left wall is another crack. Head through there to find the next Meditation Spot.\n\n### The Height, Forest of Ferocity Meditation Spot\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once you unlock the Forest of Ferocity Keeper's Shrine after escaping the Hollow, follow the cliffs all the way to the leftmost point to find the Forest of Ferocity Meditation Spot.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
