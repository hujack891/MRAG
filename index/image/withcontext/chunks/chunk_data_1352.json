He can also cast ice spells with it that summon a trail of razor-sharp icicles to rise from the ground. The key to Non-White is anticipating his blows as he winds up and perfect dodging out of the way before they hit you.

Once you're closer to the enemy, you'll roll up into a ball and sprout spikes from your body to stab the enemy with. This is a strong attack that is even further enhanced by the equipped effect that bolsters your poison and frost damage.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
