Located in the lowest section of The Webbed Hollow, he is one of the many frog minibosses you can encounter in the game, though he sports a hidden surprise.\n\n* Rewards: Buddha's Left Hand (Key Item), Tadpole, Refined Iron Sand, 1562 Experience, 1449 Will\n\n\nBaw-Li-Guhh-Baw is an optional encounter that you'll find exploring the massive Webbed Hollow Portion of Chapter 4. After descending down past the Buddha's Right Hand and spying on the Spider Sisters, you can head down a long path with an optional passage through a fissure on the right.\n\nThis path will lead you to a ledge with an archer, and then right along the path above the main trail where the Lower Hollow Shrine is to where the frog boss waits in a flooded cavern. You can also climb up to the ledge from the Shrine by jumping and performing aerial heavy attacks.\n\n## Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe most devious attack of all doesn't even start with his tongue. If you've studied his regular attacks, his hand slaps almost always start with his right hand (to your left) when not performing a large leap. However, if you see him quickly raise his left hand while hopping close (to your right) dodge immediately, or you'll be grabbed.\"\n            - Following Text: \"This will cause his tongue-hand to shoot out and carry you upwards, fill you with poison immediately, and then slam you down! It's more than likely this will eliminate almost all your health, leaving the poison to finish the job if you aren't quick with an antimiasma pill (or took one earlier).\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
