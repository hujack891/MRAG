Below you'll find a guide to accessing the temple with all three bell locations, and how to defeat the secret Yaoguai King boss, Elder Jinchi.\n\nThis Chapter 1 Secret can only be accessed by ringing three large bells found around Black Wind Mountain, and will transport you to a different location to fight the secret boss that possess a magical item that is instrumental in defeating the Black Wind King.\n\n\n* **Bamboo Grove** \\- Traveling through the very short region of the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll have to defeat a character boss, the Whiteclad Noble. Once he retreats, look for a path off to the left instead of heading straight into Black Wind Cave, and you’ll find a large plaza past the marsh where several Wolf Guai sit before a wolf that has been hung from a tree. Just beyond them is the final bell.\n\n\nActivate the shrine in the entrance plaza, and then be sure to look around this area before proceeding inside. Opposite the Shrine, look around the other withered tree for three nearby chests that hold lots of Will, 2 **Yarn** , 3 **Stone Spirit** , and **Guanyin’s Prayer Beads** arm gear.\n\nYou will also find that unlike the rest of Chapter 1, the Keeper's Shrine here sells a unique selection in the shop only purchasable at this Secret Area, and it's worth stocking up on the items since they're pretty rare for this point in the game:\n\n| Ancient Guanyin Temple Shrine Shop | Ancient Guanyin Temple Shrine Shop |\n| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| Evil Repelling Medicament (x2)     | Longevity Decoction (x2)           |\n| Silk (x2)                          | Yaoguai Core (x2)                  |\n\nNote - Before facing this boss, be sure to defeat the optional **Wandering Wight** that is found in the Forest of Wolves region of Black Wind Mountain if you haven’t faced him already. Not only does he share many attacks with this secret boss, but defeating this one will cause the Wandering Wight to disappear, and you will not be able to gain the Curio and Spirit that the Wight drops.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Battle - Elder Jinchi\n\nOnce Elder Jinchi is defeated, you’ll automatically be returned back to the third bell in the Marsh of the White Mist. You can now interact with the Wolf Guai hanging from the tree, causing it to turn to dust, and rewarding you with the Fireproof Mantle Vessel, and 2,000 Will.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Vessels are extremely rare and special items that not only provide a passive bonus, but can be activated when you’ve built up Ki from attacking enemies. Most Vessels are gained from completing a Secret Area’s boss fight, and will give you a huge situational advantage on the boss of that same chapter. The Fireproof Mantle allows you to negate fire damage attacks, which is what the final boss of this chapter will try to use against you!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
