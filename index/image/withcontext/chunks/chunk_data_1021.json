This character will ask you to retrieve an item from a nearby cave, and if defeated in a fight, will grant you a Transformation Spell, and then begin to sell you items later on.\n\n## Where to Find the Man-in-Stone\n\nYou can first encounter the Man-in-Stone in the Fright Cliff area of Chapter 2’s Yellow Wind Ridge. You can reach it by traveling through Sandgate Village and defeating the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, and then taking the path across a rope bridge to the right from the large sealed stone door.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Head up the path through the Fright Cliff area to the **Squall Hideout Shrine** , and then stick to the outdoor path on the right leading to a narrow crevice. You may hear someone calling out to you from down below, so head under the bridge, while watching for ambushes by a new stone enemy variant. The Poisestone is a much smaller and more agile version of the Palestone, able to dash around and expel projectiles. Defeating it will remove the stone body, but the legs will survive, and start to deploy devastating kicks if you don’t lock them down and destroy them.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
