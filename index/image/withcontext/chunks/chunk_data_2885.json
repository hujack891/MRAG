Below, you'll find a Walkthrough for the first major area of The Flaming Mountains called Woods of Ember, as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* ** **Ashen Pass I\n- Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Brown-Iron Cart\n* **Camp of Seasons**\n* **Height of Ember**\n- Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones\n- Yoaguai Chief - Gray-Bronze Cart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind\n* **Ashen Pass II**\n\n\nInstead of finding him wherever you left him kneeling, you'll now see him by the edge of the cliff. As you come back down the stairs to the area where you fought him, you'll see a small set opposite with two Buddha statues on either side. Go up these and to the left, to find him overlooking the mountain. Talk to him and exhaust any new dialogue.\n\n\nAt the top, a Lavabat will attack you as soon as you reach the area. On the right, you'll find another Bull Sergeant and two more Revenant Charbones. Clear this and then activate the **Height of Ember Keeper's Shrine** near the tree on the right.\n\n## Height of Ember\n\nLook to the right of the Keeper's Shrine to find a green Wisp to absorb. Once you've collected it, continue along the path from the Shrine, toward the open space on the left. When you reach a certain point, the Father of Stones miniboss will jump over the wall near the door on the right.\n\n\n\nWhen the next cart has been defeated, progress up the path. As you approached the cart, you will have heard someone shout for help. Who that is, will soon become clear as you climb the stairs and hear the cries for help again.\n\nEnter a large open area to find the fox guai suspended from a tree, and her two captors on the way. After she explains that she's been captured, two giant heads will descend upon the arena.\n\n### Yoaguai Chief - Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind\n\nWhen you have the Fireproof Mantle equipped, you can stand in the fire and continuously hit him without worrying about your health bar. If you hit him hard enough, he'll go flying and you'll need to catch up to him to continue landing attacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"While you're doing this, Fast as Wind will follow you blowing gusts of wind down on you. If this hits you, it will also burn you. Avoid this while you focus on putting an end to Quick as Fire.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
