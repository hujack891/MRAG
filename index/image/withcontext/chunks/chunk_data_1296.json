This Yaoguai Chief hides in the Valley of Ecstasy, serving a penance alone above a nearby brook.\n\n* **Rewards:** Non-Able Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Cold Iron Leaves, Random Materials, 1847 Experience, 1182 Will\n\n## Where to Find Non-Able\n\nJust past the crowd of Frozen Corpses, you'll find the most important thing in this region: A lone man bound and kneeling in front of a large stone pagoda on the hill above.\n\n### Non-Able Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nThat's not the only martial arts stance he can adopt, either. If you see him flex both arms vertically below his face, he'll do a variation on the three-hit palm strike. Only in these cases, he'll often follow up his third attack with a delayed final hit, spinning his body to backhand you with his glowing right hand that can decimate your health bar.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Having stamina in reserve is crucial for this phase, as Non-Able routinely flows into very long combo attacks that are hard to keep pace with. One attack will have him start with a shoulder check, and then expel energy from his raised palm. He'll quickly flow into a sweeping punch and two spinning kicks all in a row, which again is where moves like Cloud Step or Immobilize can help grant you some breathing room.\n\nExpect this fight to take you awhile to learn. For any chance of winning, you'll need to learn his first phase enough to the point you can power him down quickly before he can do much damage in return, and save the majority of your healing for phase two.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
