After defeating the imposing Stalwart, you'll be asked to complete a side quest for him.\n\n\nBefore you go over to them, harvest the **Fire Bellflower** by the Buddha statue on the right. Then, go straight up and into the midst of the fighting, to find the Pale-Axe Stalwart taking on nearby Revenants. Alongside the fighting, the area is also being pelted with firebombs so having the Fireproof Mantle Vessel here can help you focus more on the fighting and less on the fire attacks.\n\n## Pale-Axe Stalwart Boss Fight and Guide\n\nOccasionally, he will kick at you or jump up in the air, raising his axe above him. When he does the latter, he will slam it down as he lands, but even with this move, dodging is still the way to go.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The most beneficial thing to you here is the fire from above. He is also impacted by the fire attacks, so watch where the projectiles land and bait him into standing in the vicinity of them. This will build up his Fire Damage, weakening his health bar while you attack, and also completely stagger him at times, leaving him vulnerable to longer combos and heavier attacks.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
