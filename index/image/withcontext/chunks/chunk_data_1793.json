Secretly buried not far from another Yaoguai King, you'll need to seek out six Buddha Statue Eyeballs to unlock this boss.\n\n* **Rewards:** Heart of Stone, Skhanda of Feeling, Mind Core x1, Yaoguai Core x2, 1652 Experience, 1371 Will\n\n\n* Finally, when resting at the Rockrest Flat Shrine, you need only advance forward toward the entrance to the Stone Vanguard / Shigandang Boss Fights to find the final statue and Buddha's Eyeball.\n\n## Shigandang Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThough they appear in the same arena, the Shigandang is a much harder challenge compared to the Stone Vanguard. Because of this, it’s recommended that you save challenging this foe until you’re almost complete with Chapter 2 and have a good set of gear and medicines at your disposal to increase damage negation. He’s worth defeating before you fight the final boss of this chapter, as you’ll be able to craft a new weapon upon his defeat.\n\n### Secret - Defeat the Stone Vanguard with the Shigandang\nIf you find yourself having trouble with the Stone Vanguard, it is possible to get some assistance from the Shigandang in an unexpected way!\"\n            - Following Text: \"If you haven't yet defeated the Stone Vanguard on your own but have found all six Buddha Eyeballs, you can actually summon the Shigandang before engaging the Stone Vanguard. When summoned early, he will arise and immediately fight with the Stone Vanguard. The good news is he's a lot tougher than the Stone Vanguard, and will perform a flashy finisher to tear the other rock Guai to pieces, giving you all the rewards!\nOf course, after defeating the Stone Vanguard, the Shigandang will immediately turn on you, and might be too tough to fight early if you were having problems defeating the Vanguard on your own!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
