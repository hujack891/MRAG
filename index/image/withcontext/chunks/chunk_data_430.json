Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration.\n\n\nOpen the giant door at the top of the stairs. Go straight ahead and activate the Rakshasa Palace Keeper's Shrine.\n\n\nInside here, you'll find the old man who gave you the gourd at the start of the game and an Awaken Wine Worm to the left.\n\nSpeak to the old man, and he'll tell you to find yourself a decent gourd (if you haven't already upgraded yours fully) and you can share a drink with him.\n\n\n## The Emerald Hall\n\nFrom The Emerald Hall Keeper's Shrine, go left and up the stairs. A cutscene will start to play, where you'll transform into a Cicada and fly toward the center of the hall. This is where you'll find Pingping speaking to her mother, Rakshasi, accompanied by the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains.\n\nAfter they discuss The Destined One obtaining the relics, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains offers to care for Rakshashi, which Pingping protests. After he binds Pingping, Rakshashi is revealed to be Zhu Bajie transformed and it's time to take on the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains for yourself.\n\n### Yaoguai King - Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and Yin-Yang Fish\n\nThe white revenants are large enemies with clubs, while the black revenants are archers. These are the ones you want to target, as their ranged attacks can be annoying and do the most damage. Clear these revenants out as quickly as possible, to get it back to a fight against just the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains.\n\nWhen you've got his health down to around 30%, Zhu Bajie will leave you to take him on one-on-one. The aim is still to just attack normally to get his health bar down quickly.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When he's almost dead, he will then summon Ma Tianba for you to fight against.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
