If you have trouble facing them, always try to bring them to a brighter spot.\n\nNote that if you went ahead and defeated the Secret Boss by ringing the three bells, you should also have access to craft an additional Bronze Set that improves your abilities using the Immobilize Spell!\n\nCraft and upgrade whatever you can afford at the moment, because a boss is waiting inside the temple to test your might, and he’s no pushover.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Black Wind King\n\nOnce you see the wisp fly up, retreat away from the center of the arena where the Black Wind King will reappear in a large explosion.
