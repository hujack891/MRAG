An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n## Yellow Wind Ridge\n\nA large stone arch behind the archers has a new violet Licorice plant you can harvest, and the stone stairs beyond lead to an altar with a special **Lambbrew Drink** for your Gourd. Unlike the instant heal of the Coconut Wine, it will heal a small amount at first, but a larger portion of your health bar over time. However, you’ll also find that it can only be upgraded once, compared to the multiple tiers of health increase that you can invest in the other drink.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Head back down to the pond, and you’ll find the waterway leads on a bit past several Croaky frog enemies, as well as a new kind of Rat standing by the shore. This Rat Governor wields an electric staff, which he can charge up and zap you from a distance with after a flourish, or perform a backwards jump to zap you in mid-air. If you take enough shock damage, you’ll reach a state where all incoming damage is doubled, so avoid these blasts at all costs and shut him down with Immobilize.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
