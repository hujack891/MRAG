Go down the stairs and to the end of the path to find a Meditation Spot.\n\nReturn to the Keeper's Shrine and continue past it, following the path to the right. Head down to the slope, collecting the green Wisp on the left and into the center of the room. As you reach the middle, you'll be met by the first of the bosses in this secret area.\n\n\nGet back to the path and go past the next two bull guards to find the Cave Depths Keeper's Shrine.\n\n\nDrop down toward the lava and go left into the ice-covered portion of the room. Open the chest on the right to collect Celestial Ribbon and a Mind Core.\n\nHead down to the left, and slide all the way down the slope. Here you'll reach the final Keeper's Shrine of the hidden area, called the Corridor of Fire and Ice.\n\n\nHead right from the Keeper's Shrine and go down the stairs. A cutscene will play as you drop down, and the Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast will appear.\n\n## Yaoguai King - Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast\n\nThe Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast likes to use punching attacks similar to the Stone Vanguard and the coffin carts. It will perform combos of smashing its fists down and creating pools of lava that will explode. The best way to deal with these is to dodge them or try to hang back from the beast as far as you can.\"\n            - Following Text: \"It will sometimes roll over when it tries to punch you and misses, allowing you to perform a quick follow-up attack. Where it differs from the other bosses, is that it will also leap up in the air and land like a frog, creating an explosion around it each time it lands. This move can be quite erratic, but you can avoid it entirely by keeping your distance.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
