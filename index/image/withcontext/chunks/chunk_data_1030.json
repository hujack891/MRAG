This character will ask you to retrieve an item from a nearby cave, and if defeated in a fight, will grant you a Transformation Spell, and then begin to sell you items later on.\n\n## Where to Find the Man-in-Stone\n\nAt the end of the cave path, you’ll find the object of the Man-in-Stone’s quest - an even larger statue embedded with shining blue crystals. Don’t get too enraptured that you miss a Poisestone along the walls trying to ambush you, though.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Miniboss - Mother of Stone\n\nThere’s one last wave of two after this, for a total of six Palestones for the whole fight. Again, don’t hold back, and use your Transformation Spell to power down at least one of the enemies as quickly as possible so you aren’t overwhelmed. Don’t be afraid to back well off and heal to stay out of range of their projectiles.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once all six Palestones are down, there’s nothing left that the Mother of Stone can do, so keep smacking it until the boss breaks apart. You’ll be awarded the Stone Essence Key Item, as well as some Stone Spirits and Yaoguai Cores.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
