Not to be confused with his brother, the Tiger Vanguard of the Crouching Tiger Temple, you can only reach this boss by following the trail of a ghostly boy using the Old Rattle-Drum Key Item.\n\n* Rewards: Mad Tiger Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Yaoguai Core x1, Stone Spirit x1, 1102 Experience, 1023 Will, Plaguebane Gourd (in chest)\n\n\nUsing the Rattle-Drum here one final time will cause the spirit of the boy to appear before you, and invite you to hop down the well to meet a “friend”. Unfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there.\n\n## Mad Tiger Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nOther times, he’ll perform a feinting strike by leaping to one side of you with an uppercut, and then changing direction to slam down after a delay in your direction.\"\n            - Following Text: \"There’s another leaping jump he can perform to twist his body high in the air like his brother before crashing down, only this attack also sends his head slamming into the ground. This can work in your favor with a well-timed dodge, as he slowly recovers while grabbing his head from the impact.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
