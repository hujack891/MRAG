This character will ask you to retrieve an item from a nearby cave, and if defeated in a fight, will grant you a Transformation Spell, and then begin to sell you items later on.\n\n## Where to Find the Man-in-Stone\n\nAt the end of the cave path, you’ll find the object of the Man-in-Stone’s quest - an even larger statue embedded with shining blue crystals. Don’t get too enraptured that you miss a Poisestone along the walls trying to ambush you, though.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Miniboss - Mother of Stone\n\nOnce all six Palestones are down, there’s nothing left that the Mother of Stone can do, so keep smacking it until the boss breaks apart. You’ll be awarded the Stone Essence Key Item, as well as some Stone Spirits and Yaoguai Cores.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Return back to the crevice. Once you hand the Stone Essence over, the Man-in-Stone will burst out of the ground and declare you gullible for just giving it to him. That’s not very nice, and it sounds like he deserves a beatdown to get your reward.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
