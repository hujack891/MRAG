Located in the center of the Crouching Tiger Temple, this fearsome Tiger Guai is one of the hardest bosses to overcome in all of Chapter 2.\n\n* **Rewards:** Rock Solid Spell, Keeness of Tiger, Mind Core x1, Silk x3, 1652 Experience, 1362 Will\n\n\nYou can find him inside the Crouching Tiger Temple, which is located at the end of the Sandgate Village, taking a left after defeating the King of Flowing Sands and through a crack in the wall in the Valley of Despair.\n\n## Tiger Vanguard Boss Fight and Guide\n\nDespite carrying a sword on his back, it’s the Tiger Vanguard’s fists you’ll need to worry about — at least for the start. He’ll use adapting martial arts moves with a mix of heavy punches, kicks, and slams that can come from any direction due to his agile movements.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Be ready for him to begin by quickly strafing to your side before launching into a flying punch. Moves like this will take him a moment to get up from the slam, giving you a good amount of time to start a light combo on him.\n\nHe can also quickly employ two different two-punch strikes — one that you’ll want to punish, and other avoid. If he starts with an uppercut and downward fist slam, he’ll pause for a moment to shake off his fist from the force of the impact, which is your time to shine and lay into him.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
