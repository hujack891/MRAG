You’ll also meet the owner of the voice on the wind - the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain.\n\nThis friendly guy will be your guide and mentor for this part of the world, and will bid you to set out in search of Guanyin Temple, which burned down long ago but has since been rebuilt - but not by human hands. As the Keeper departs, he’ll bestow you with the Incense Trail Talisman, which can let you warp back to the last Shrine you rested at.\n\n\nOpposite the balcony, you can spot some torches marking a tunnel passage into the rocks. Delve inside to find a familiar golden trail leading to the next Shrine. Now that you’ve grown, so to has the Shrine’s options, as you’ll be able to set Spells to your quickbar, reset your Skill Tree if you wish to experiment, and start buying and selling things at the store:\n\nBlack Wind Mountain Shrine Store\n| Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store          | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store    | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store  | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store |\n| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| Evil Repelling Medicament (x3) - 270 Will | Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Antimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will |                                  |\n| Yarn (x4) - 300 Will                      | Stone Spirit (x4) - 450 Will        |                                   |                                  |\n| Aged Ginseng (x5) - 90 Will               | Purple Lingzhi (x5) - 90 Will       | Gentian (x5) - 90 Will            | Jade Lotus (x5) - 90 Will        |\n| Snake-Head Mushroom (x5) - 120 Will       |                                     |                                   |                                  |\n\nSince you can’t craft medicine yet, you probably don’t need to be buying ingredients, but the medicines offered here are fairly rare to find in this chapter, so it won’t hurt to buy a few of each, and then sell any Pieces of Gold you’ve found.\n\n## Outside the Forest\n\nThe far side of the stream has many more materials to collect, and most importantly, a path leading from the bridge where the archer was to a small archway where another extremely important yet optional mini-boss awaits you.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Guangzhi\n\nIf he starts to whirl his fiery blade in circles around him, be ready but don’t panic as his attack is yet to come — wait for him to raise the blade and twirl it high before swinging it from side to side in two slower hits.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Another scary move that may take a bit of practice to understand is his pogo jump: Watch for him to raise his weapon high and vertical over his head before slamming it down, and then somersaulting forward in quick succession to bounce off the ground off his weapon. After a short pause, he’ll leap up to slam down for a third attack, and then even higher up for one last pogo slam explosion. With the last two attacks being spaced out, stand your ground to wait for the drop to dodge around, and cast Immobilize once he’s grounded to pin him down while you unleash your attacks.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
