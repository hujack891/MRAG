Located along the main path through the Bamboo Grove, this boss is a ranged fighter who moves quickly to evade you while filling you with poison strikes.\n\n* **Rewards:** Guangmou Spirit, Materials, 700 Experience, 520 Will\n\n## Where to Find Guangmou\n\nFollow the main path across the bridge from the Shrine and down to a stream, and follow it into a large bamboo forest patrolled by snakes. On the opposite side of the circular forest, you can spot two small statues forming an entrance into the grove where Guagnmou lurks.\n\n### Guangmou Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nAn interesting note is that he needs to control the orb’s direction, meaning you can cast Immobilize when he summons the orb to lock both him and his projectile in place, nullifying the attack!\n\nSometimes, he won’t even bother with the orb, and will simply wave his fan rapidly to create a tornado at your last known position, so staying mobile and pressing your attack can help you avoid these attacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Easily the most annoying move in his repertoire is when he calls out to his “Boys”. He’ll then summon a number of poisonous snakes out of the ground all over the arena, who will all spit venom at you around 5-6 times before vanishing. While they technically do have health bar, it’s not worth engaging with any of them — giving you two viable options: Run and dodge like crazy, or find a corner of the arena where you can see them all, and use your staff spin to nullify the projectiles. This last trick won’t last forever due to the stamina drain, and also due to Guangmou’s meddling during the summons, but it can provide a temporary respite.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
