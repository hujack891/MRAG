Below you'll find a guide to accessing the mountain by defeating the Venom Daoist, and how to complete Hong Yi the Snake Guai's quest to defeat the Daoist Mi and Duskveil, as well as the formidable Scorpionlord.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* How to Access Purple Cloud Mountain\n* **Valley of Blooms**\n* **Bounds of Deity's Abode**\n- Yaoguai King - The Scorpionlord\n* **Petalfall Hamlet**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Daoist Mi\n* **Cloudnest Peak**\n- Yaoguai King - The Duskveil\n\nThis Chapter 4 Secret can only be accessed by finding and defeating the Venom Daoist in two different locations, and will transport you to a different location to fight a secret Yaoguai King and repair a Vessel that is instrumental in defeating the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master.\n\n\nWhen the Venom Daoist is finally defeated, he'll point to a mural that will appear on a nearby wall, sending you to Purple Cloud Mountain.\n\n\nThe start of this region is a linear mountain path lined with a few materials to harvest, and up ahead you'll hear the sounds of someone crying. The \"someone\" is actually a snake guai (named Hong Yi). The widower was forced out of her mountaintop village by insect guais led by the Scorpionlord, rendering her unable to retrieve her late husband's keepsakes.\n\nShe'll warn you of the dangerous venom of the enemies ahead, and you can even find a **Treasure Chest** near her that holds 3 Antimiasma Powder that will be incredibly useful when taking on the Scorpionlord.\n\nHead across the bridge to the right and grab a green Wisp, and go through the archway into the next larger area.\n\n\nAs you might expect, this one will take a lot longer to kill with its strengthened spirit, so expend your big hits and spirit attacks, making sure to stop and take out whatever minions he summons. When he finally falls, you'll get the Verdant Glow Spirit, which allows you to heal rather than invoke an attack.\n\nBe sure to also look at the normal tree near where the Lushleaf was meditating. It has a **Luojia Fragrant Vine** wrapped around it that you can claim.\n\n\nWhen you head up the stairway path, you'll spot a large open area with a small building along the cliffside, and a large yaoguai lounging on the roof and grumbling to himself. As you approach, he'll tell you to get lost and leave him to his drink, so if you're spoiling for a fight, smack one of the pots on the ground, and he'll come leaping down for some action.\n\n\nNow you can return to the archway guarded by two Spear Daoists on the far left side of this area, and behind them you'll find the Shrine for the next area.\n\n## Petalfall Hamlet\n\nReturn back across the bridge first, and make your way through the overgrown path to cross a bridge.\"\n            - Following Text: \"A bigger building sits here with a Spear Daoist guarding the entrance to an inner courtyard. Inside, beware of Spider Puppets, making sure both are dealt with before going for the **Treasure Chest** at the far side.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
