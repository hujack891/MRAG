An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n\nNow it’s time to finally open that door the Rat Captains were guarding. In the next scene, you’ll spot the next major boss fight: a tiny Rat King and his oversized son.\n\n\nAnother terrifying new move is for him to do a slow spin ending with a weapon toss right at you. He’ll quickly follow up with a leaping dive attack to reach his mace, and then pull it out of the ground and swing it forth, which should quell any thoughts of trying to attack at this point.\n\nIdeally, the lower you have his health before killing his father, the less time you’ll have to worry about this phase if you can rush him down. If you don’t kill his dad, he’ll scurry off as soon as the Second Prince falls. If not, you’ll be able to help yourself to the Second Prince’s Spirit, as well as a Pungent Flesh Chunk.\n\n## Valley of Despair\n\nBefore you do that, instead take a left to where the sun shines down on a large rat statue and a curved wall, as well as a large pit. The pit holds one last major boss to deal with, which can arrive in a few ways.\n\n\nIf you try dodging around and attacking from the side, be aware that he can either use a quick tail swipe to stagger you, or swing his arm back quickly to draw you away from flanking him, so don’t get too comfortable.\n\nEven as big as he is with a larger health pool, he’s not as ferocious as the enraged Second Prince. Do note however there is a **secret trick in this fight** : If you lure him into doing one of his larger slam attacks while your back is to the curved wall, his strikes may cause the wall to crack - revealing a secret!\n\nOnce he’s been defeated, he’ll drop the **Arhat Gold Piece** Key Item. We'll need it for a sidequest elsewhere in this chapter.\n\n### The Loong’s Secret Tomb\n\nFinally, exit the room where the first Swift Bat was to find a canyon path down to the Crouching Tiger Temple.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Due to the layout of this area and the progression of a few sidequests, we’ll be coming back here later, and continue by traveling back to where the Second Prince was defeated and crossing the bridge right to the **Fright Cliff**.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
