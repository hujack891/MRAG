Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the grove and learning how to cultivate Spirits, accessing a secret realm, as well as how to defeat the many bosses of this area that include Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, Guangmou, and the Whiteclad Noble.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Back Hills**\n* **Snake Trail**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Guangmo\n* **Marsh of the White Mist**\n- Boss FIght - Whiteclad Noble\n\n\nTo advance, keep heading up the stairway to cross the high bridge over the falls, where you’ll soon see the golden trail of a nearby shrine beckoning you left. Before making that turn, be sure to look to the right to find a small wooden gazebo with a small table, and open the small gold box on top to find a variety of medicines, including 2 **Tiger Subduing Pellets** , 1 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 1 **Amplification Pellet**.\n\n## Snake Trail\n\nThis path leads to a marshy swamp area full of tall white reed flowers. Several Croaky enemies hide within them, so use your lock-on to identify them so you aren’t ambushed. However, as you make your way through the marsh toward a large stone mural in the cliffs, an optional mini-boss will leap out to fight you.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n\nWhen Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang finally falls, he’ll leave behind his purple Spirit and a Tadpole Material. Using your new Blessed Gourd upgrade, you can now absorb the Spirit and add Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang’s power to your own, and temporarily transform to unleash a tongue attack against several enemies. If you decide to commit to cultivating his spirit and upgrading its damage potential, you can use the Tadpole he dropped to further upgrade it later on.\"\n            - Following Text: \"From the mini-boss lair, you can head past where the toad emerged from to the right to find a path with a green wisp Spirit you can absorb for a decent amount of Will.
