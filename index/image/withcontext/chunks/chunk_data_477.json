You can find it at the Rhino Watch Slope, which the Feng-Tail General will conveniently take you to.\n\n## How to Find Gold Armored Rhino\n\nOnce you've completed the stamina and health test from the Feng-Tail General, drop down from it and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire.\n\n### Gold Armored Rhino Boss Fight and Guide\n\nBeyond this, expect attacks where it will charge at you. There are rocks you can use in the arena to hide behind for a little while. However, once these are destroyed, you'll need to dodge out of the way. When it's close to you, it will also try to swipe at you by pulling its head back, then swinging it to the side to catch you with its horn. These are great moves to dodge and build up focus if you've unlocked the ability to do so in the skills tab.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Lastly, you can expect a few projectile attacks from the Rhino as well. When it puts its horn down to the ground and drags along it, it will flick rocks up at you. Usually, these are five rocks at a time and you can move out of the way of them easily if you're not too close to the Rhino.\n\nThe fight is very much a rinse-and-repeat situation, where you'll just want to try and hit the horn as much as you can to try and break it.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
