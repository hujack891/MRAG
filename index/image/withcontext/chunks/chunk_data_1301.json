For that portion of the fight, you will mainly contend with stomp and kick-based attacks. During the second half of the fight, however, Non-Able tears his ropes, freeing his hands and widening his move pool.\n\nThe timing of Non-Able's punches follows the same pattern as his kicks. Watch closely and wait for him to wind up before quickly dodging out of the way before his hit lands.\n\n## Non-Able Spirit\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Seasoned Punch**\n* Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Attack, Critical Hit Chance, and Critical Damage, but massively reduces Maximum Mana.\n\nNon-Able's Spirit Power is a very situational one. It allows you to take the form of Non-Able and deliver a flurry of blows on your foe. The attack itself is fine, but the equipped effect is quite harsh and will render Non-Able more or less unusable, depending on your playstyle. Non-Able's equipped effect raises your Attack, Critical Hit Chance, and Critical Damage but massively reduces your Maximum Mana. And when they say massively, they mean it. If you use magic a lot, Non-Able might not be a good Spirit for you.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
