Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby.\n\n## Rhino Watch Slope\n\nIn the midst of the trees, there's a small patch of ground with no grass. The Poison Chief can be found here.\n\n\nThankfully, each of the Poison Chief fights is pretty much the same. You can expect the same moveset and should prepare for them in the same way.\n\nWhen the second Poison Chief is down, return to the Rhino Watch Slope and then head into the area with the flames on the ground. A cutscene will play out as you get there, and the Gold Armored Rhino will appear.\n\n\nWhen you get to the edge, look down to see a muddy clearing. Down here, you can find the next optional boss, which is the final frog Lang-Baw-Baw.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Baw-Baw\n\nWhen it comes to the one-to-one with Lang-Baw-Baw, you can expect to see the same type of moves that the previous frog bosses have used (if you've taken them all down so far). Expect to see it use its tongue as a whip to try and hit you, which you can dodge and dash away from. It will also leap up and try to belly flop you, as well as use its back kicks to quickly lash out when you're behind it.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The big difference with Lang-Baw-Baw is that you need to watch the color of its body to know when it's best to attack and in what way. When its body is red, it's vulnerable to attack. In this state, you'll do the most damage, so you'll want it to stay like this for as long as possible.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
