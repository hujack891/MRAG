You can also check out a small stream to the right with more plants to harvest in and around the water, and a green Wisp to absorb (it's guarded by another Puppet Spider).\n\nIn fact, this town is teeming with green Wisps of all sizes, which means you'll have a lot of these little spirits to absorb to gain both will and some of your Gourd charges back in a pinch.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Take the main path first to find a few enemies up ahead, and an open shack on the right where the dim glow of another green Wisp can be seen. Be wary, as there's another Puppet Spider hiding in the shadows waiting for you to try and absorb the spirit!\n\nApproach the enemy holding the lanterns cautiously, as the other side of the shack you investigated hides an archer who will try to ambush you once you engage the other foe.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
