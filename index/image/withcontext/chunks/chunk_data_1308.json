This Yaoguai Chief is located just below the entrance to the final boss of the New Thunderclap Temple, and can prove to be a formidable foe.\n\n* **Rewards:** Non-Pure Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Refined Iron Sand, Random Materials, 1270 Experience, 893 Will\n\n## Where to Find Non-Pure\n\nIn fact, you'll find him just to the right of the large inner courtyard leading up to the Mahavira Hall Shrine where Yellowbrow awaits. After defeating the two Dark-faced Overlords guarding the courtyard, you'll find him in a small building standing over a Meditation Spot.\n\n### Non-Pure Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nAnother quick two-hit combo he can employ is a quick side slice followed by an overhead slam. Since many of his combo attacks cover both vertical and horizontal hits, you can't just backpedal in one direction to evade them.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When he decides to get nasty with his combos, you'll either want to learn the moves and deflect one to knock him off balance, or Immobilize to shut him down. One of his most lengthy combos will come when he sweeps his weapon upward and then back down for two rotations, and then quickly swings it back and forth three more times, before leaping up to perform one last spin attack as he lands. Without a lot of stamina in reserve, it will be tough one to evade completely.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
