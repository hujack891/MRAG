Below you'll find a guide for the first upper area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find your first encounter with the Venom Daoist, and the different ways to reach The Verdure Bridge.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Upper Hollow**\n* **Pool of Shattered Jade**\n- Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nBefore following the golden trail of a nearby Shrine, look to the left of the bed and small chest to find a path leading to another larger **Treasure Chest** you can open to claim a **Cuo Jin-Yin Belt Hook Curio** , another item that can help resist all the poison you'll be encountering.\n\n\nYou'll now find yourself on the opposite side of the Hollow from where you first started, with a group of platforms in front of you that offer a one-way ticket down to the start of the Middle Hollow and the Verdure Bridge. However, going down there now would cause to a miss a large optional area complete with a boss (but you can drop down early to grab the Shrine and warp back up if you want).\n\n\nCarefully carve a path through the Clawed Cocoons to reach the other side, and you'll find yourself in a large chamber with an even bigger cocoon hanging down from the middle. Something angry is muttering to itself inside, and its apparently waiting for you.\n\n## Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nHead back to the Pool of Shattered Jade Shrine, and look back to the path where the Scorpion Prince was to spot a large wooden scaffold bridge. Be sure to check around the left side first for a green Wisp, then cross the two-tiered bridge to drop down a level.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Look out for an archer on the lower floor here, and get rid of him before crossing the bridge to find a ledge with another green Wisp.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
