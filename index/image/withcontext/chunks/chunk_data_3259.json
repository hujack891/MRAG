Below you'll find a guide to accessing the kingdom of the past by undertaking the Drunk Boar's Questline to find a Sobering Stone, and how to defeat the Tiger Vanguard and secret Yaoguai King Boss, Fuban.\n\n* Jump to a Section:\n* **How to Access the Kingdom of Sahali**\n- Yaoguai Chief - \"Tiger Vanguard\"\n* **Sandgate Bound**\n- Yaoguai King - Fuban\n\nThis Chapter 2 Secret can only be accessed by meeting the Yellow-Robed Square in Fright Cliff (aka the Drunken Boar), and helping him in his search for the \"Realm of Gold\" which requires a few steps (and for you to best him in combat).\n\n\nOnce you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into the Kingdom of Sahali\n\n\nAs you round the corner, you’ll be told to halt by the defender of a large gate: A slightly familiar looking Tiger Guai who calls himself the Vanguard of the Yellow Wind King. If he looks familiar to another Vanguard you’ve faced, that’s because he’s actually the other Vanguard’s father! He’ll ask that you turn around and head home, which seems like such a waste with all you’ve gone through just to get here.\n\n\nUpon defeat, you’ll gain the **Tiger Tally** curio, and he’ll realize your prowess and invite you to meet his king.\n\n\nThe yellow-furred rat is at an impasse, as the scarab’s magic is preventing him from engaging the monster directly. This is where you come on. The Yellow Rat Sage will agree to pound the drums to force the scarab to the surface, allowing you to engage the behemoth directly and find whatever vessel is giving it its power.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Fuban\n\nOnce Fuban starts another charge, he’ll repeat doing several leap attacks in a row that you’ll need to keep avoiding. Luckily, the Yellow Wind Sage will put an end to this by banging the drums more to stun Fuban entirely.\"\n            - Following Text: \"At this point, the battle will be paused and Fuban stunned, allowing you to climb up via its head to reach the large statue on its back. Jump onto the statue head, and look for a glowing eye to examine. You’ll then retrieve the Vessel that gives Fuban much of its power to fend off the yellow rat, who can now join you for the rest of the battle!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
