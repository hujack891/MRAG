In a small tunnel past the Shrine, you'll encounter a large cocoon that holds the Venom Daoist.\n\nAfter defeating him a first time, proceed through to the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Once you reach a fork in the road where the left path leads to the Court of Illumination Shrine, look for a path leading right up a mountain trail. Once you reach the top of the stairs, you'll find an alcove to the left leading down a large slope to an arena where the rematch will occur.\n\n## Venom Daoist Boss Fight and Guide - First Encounter\n\nWhen up close, he'll usually either perform an overhand slash followed by a leaping attack, or he'll pull back his swords to your left for two quick slashes followed by a dash attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Be ready for him to leap back with two more slashes after the dash, and wait until he returns to counter -- or simply Rock Solid his dash attack to stagger him back.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
