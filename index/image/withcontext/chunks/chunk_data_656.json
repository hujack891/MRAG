If you want to be able to deflect melee attacks and stagger enemies, you'll need to unlock a spell in Chapter 2 allowing you to do so. With that in mind, here's everything you need to know from how to get hold of Rock Solid to how and when to use it.\n\n* How to Unlock the Rock Solid Spell\n* How to Parry Enemy Attacks in Black Myth: Wukong\n* Spells to Unlock to Upgrade Rock Solid\n\n## How to Unlock the Rock Solid Spell\n\nCan you parry in Black Myth: Wukong? The short answer is no, not in the traditional sense. But you can deflect enemy attacks, and to do so requires the **Rock Solid spell**. This is a defensive spell that will allow you to stagger enemies and open up the possibility of performing counterattacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"You'll need to wait until you reach Chapter 2 and have defeated the Tiger Vanguard at the Crouching Tiger Temple before you can unlock it. Slaying the Tiger Vanguard will automatically grant you the Rock Solid spell and let you turn your monkey into stone.\n\nOnce you have the spell, visit a Keeper's Shrine and select Self-Advance to see the option to Set Spells. Replace Cloud Step with Rock Solid, and you're ready to start parrying.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
