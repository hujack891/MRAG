They'll use this to jump up in the air, pull back, and spin to launch themselves toward you. They will keep rolling around the room, and it's just a case of dodging this. However, when they're about to finish, they become significantly more aggressive and will leap up in the air again, slamming the ball down and causing explosions on impact. You'll need to dodge or jump to avoid this.
