From the Shrine, head to the right through the open forest, and you will find the Wight.\n\nYou need to defeat this boss before you defeat the optional boss in the Chapter 1 Secret Area by ringing three large bells. Once you challenge the boss of the Ancient Guanyin Temple, the Wandering Wight will disappear, and you will no longer be able to challenge him and gain his rewards!\n\nThis technically counts as one of the Blood of the Iron Bull's you get from the blue glowing enemies, as you get the Wandering Wight Spirit here.
