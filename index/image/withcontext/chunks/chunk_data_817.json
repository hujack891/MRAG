Located upon the large lake of Mirrormere in Snowhill Path, she will be summoned to defend her master Goldenbrow, who holds the Sage's Relic you seek.\n\n* **Rewards:** Starlit Cloud-Bidden Antler\n\n## Where to Find Kang-Jin Loong\n\nAs a required boss fight, you'll encounter Kang-Jin Loong when attempting to infiltrate the small temple on the frozen lake in Mirrormere at the end of the Snowhill Path.\n\n### Kang-Jin Loong Boss Fight and Guide\n\nBe wary when Kang-Jin Loong begins to roar and emit lightning all around, as they can perform an attack to summon a series of lightning strikes along the ground. They'll track your position, so keep strafing and dodging to outpace them, and don't worry about fighting while in this evasive mode.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Other times, with a particularly loud roar, the boss will summon a giant circle of lightning strikes all around them. They only hit a few times in different spots, and usually at a fair distance from the boss, so pursuing it and keeping close is often the way to go.\n\nMuch of this fight is about patience and waiting for the right time to strike back, as you don't want to waste time swinging wildly when there's no hope of reaching the boss. Let them come to you, and look for the right moments with stationary claw swipes or tail slams to deflect with Rock Solid for a better chance to stagger them.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
