Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Ashen Pass III**\n- Boss Fight - Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n* **Cooling Slope**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n- Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\n* **Fallen Furnace Crater**\n- Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n- Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\n\nAfter defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the Yin-Yang Fish, and the Crimson-Silver Cart, you'll have climbed to the top of the Flaming Mountains and be closer to finding out where the Bull King is.\n\n\nThe gauntlet is almost over! As you continue on, there's a small gap on the left you can dart into and then it's onward toward the flames. When you approach, a cutscene will begin where you'll see the golden spiked ball go flying off the end of the cliff.\n\nAfter the cutscene, ignore Pingping running off, and turn back to where you came from. Remember the wall of flames? Head back there. Now that the ball is gone, it's safe to explore the area slowly and you'll find the flames have also disappeared. A path has been revealed, which is the Cooling Slope, and the next place we'll explore.\n\n\nCollect the green Wisps from the far edge on the left, then follow the path where the fox went toward the Bull King. This will take you down a path that leads up to the Bull King, and where you can find the next Keeper's Shrine called Fallen Furnace Crater.\n\n## Fallen Furnace Crater\n\nHead up the slope to see Pingping speak to her father. The Bull King isn't best pleased with The Destined One, but also has an issue with Pingping and her deception. It turns out that Pingping is actually the Red Boy, and he will transform before your eyes, ready for a battle.\n\n\nWhen he's back down on the floor after sending out the duplicates, his attacks will be way more aggressive and he'll be more agile. You'll find that he repeats the same variations of attack, they'll just have a wider reach. For example, he'll spin his spear for longer, resulting in fire emerging around him, and then will leave areas of the ground covered in flames.\n\nYou can approach the second part of the fight in much the same way you did the first, and if you haven't used too many spells, now is the time to unleash them and get the rest of his health down as soon as possible.\n\nAfter being the Red Boy, the Bull King will reveal the stone that was kept in his belly. At the end of the conversation, the Red Boy's body will begin to disappear. But before The Destined One can collect the stone, the Red Boy emerges, showing that he used a False Death Talisman and is actually alive. He consumes the stone and immediately transforms into the Yaksha King.\n\n### Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\n\nThere's one particular attack in this second half of the fight where he'll charge at you. You'll need to dodge this, otherwise, he'll grab you and a short cutscene will begin. The Yaksha King will pummel The Destined One, and when you restart the fight, you'll see a significant chunk of your health gone.\"\n            - Following Text: \"You can approach this fight in a similar way to the Red Boy, in that it's best to save your spells until the second portion. Immobilize works on him, so when he's darting around more in the second half, you can trap him and make it easier to attack. Ebon Flow is also a good spell to use in this fight, as you can block his attacks with the defense option and build up focus to unleash heavy attacks to stagger him.\n\nWith the Yaksha King defeated, Zhu Bajie will get him to spit out the relic. Chapter 5 comes to an end with Rakshasi appearing and promising to never leave the mountain again, and handing over the Plantain Fan to the Destined One.\n\nWith the chapter's end, you'll earn the Grieved Body, and the talents you can pick from it are:\n\n* **Nimble Body -** Massively reduces the Stamina cost of all charged Heavy Attacks.\n* **Everlasting Vitality -** Considerably increases Maximum Health.\n* **Divine Safeguard -** Considerably increases Four Banes Resistance.\n\nIt's time to venture to Mount Huago to start the final chapter of Black Myth: Wukong.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
