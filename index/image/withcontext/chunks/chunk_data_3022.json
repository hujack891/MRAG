Clear out the foes, and then open it to find a **Copper Pill** Soak for your Gourd. This one in particular has an impressive effect to negate the cost of Rock Solid when used soon after using the gourd.\n\n\nOpen the large gate the Rat Imperial Guard were posted at, and head through to the other side. Be sure to look to the right as you open the gate, and you’ll find a tree with glowing flowers on it. Gather the **Luojia Fragrant Vine** , and be sure to return to the Shen Monkey later to improve your Gourd when you can!\n\nWatch out for another Lingzhiling in disguise nearby from the fragrant vine, and then travel up the path (check a small cave on the left for a green Wisp) and up to the Windrest Hamlet Shrine.\n\n## Windrest Hamlet\n\nHead down the path around the homes, and you can find a wooden chest with 3 **Yaoguai Core** in an open area near a very long bridge leading back across the ravine toward Fright Cliff. However, a lone and imposing figure will block you as you try to cross the bridge.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Tiger’s Acolyte\n\nHead back to the bridge where you fought the Tiger’s Acolyte, and cross to the far side. You’ll enter a large cave here, and a few Swift Bats will appear to harass you.\"\n            - Following Text: \"After taking them out, look for an opening in the cave wall where a large column is, and at its base will be a small chest near a Blazebone firing projectiles at you. Loot the chest after defeating it to gain a new Curio - the **Glazed Reliquary**.\n\nJust past the box, you can find stairs down to a path leading out the cave, putting you on a ledge right above where you fought the Stone Vanguard in the Fright Cliff!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
