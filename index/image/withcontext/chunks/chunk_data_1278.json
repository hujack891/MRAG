This Yaoguai Chief hides in the Valley of Ecstasy, serving a penance alone above a nearby brook.\n\n* **Rewards:** Non-Able Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Cold Iron Leaves, Random Materials, 1847 Experience, 1182 Will\n\n## Where to Find Non-Able\n\nNon-Able is an optional boss, and sits alone in a large snowy field in the Valley of Ecstasy. You'll find him by heading down the hill from the main road in the Forest of Felicity and into the Brook of Bliss, and then cross the bridge and head up the hill past the Shrine.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Just past the crowd of Frozen Corpses, you'll find the most important thing in this region: A lone man bound and kneeling in front of a large stone pagoda on the hill above.\n\n### Non-Able Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nDon't mistake his subdued appearance for weakness, Non-Able is probably one of the toughest Yaoguai Chief bosses you'll face in Chapter 3. Unlike other enemies, he won't use any magic or ranged tricks on you, and trades it all in for overwhelming power and a mastery of martial arts that makes him an extremely challenging foe -- and that's before the restraints come off.\n\nIf you haven't made use of them in other fights, now is definitely the time to take advantage of all the medicinal pills and consumable buffs you can craft and use. Items like the Tiger Subduing Pellets to raise your attack and others that can raise your stamina or focus can all help out greatly, and you'll want every advantage on your side.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
