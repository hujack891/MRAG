Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration.\n\n## Valley Entrance\n\nUltimately, you're going to go left to continue on the main path (and you may start to hear characters talk as you approach this pillar), but for now, you'll want to detour and explore the area to the right.\n\nThe first thing you'll see as you go to the right is the Flamlings that sit in the lava. These will spit fire at you, so it's best to deal with them to remove the ranged attacks while you explore.\n\n\nDrop down here, and head right first to collect the Fire Date from the tree. Then go in the opposite direction toward the lava streaming from the ceiling. This is where you can find one of the optional bosses in Chapter 5, the Flint Chief.\n\n\nNow turn back the other way and continue up the valley. At the top of the path, you'll come to another archway and the start of Rakshasa Palace.\n\nAs soon as you pass through the archway, the next boss battle will begin and you'll discover who was responsible for the voices you heard earlier.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Cloudy Mist, Misty Cloud\n\nAs Cloudy Mist is the first to appear, this should be where you first attack. Things will change when you manage to hit Cloudy Mist enough times that it will send out a bright light as a flashbang that can stun both you and Misty Cloud. For a brief moment, Misty Cloud won't be able to see you and Cloudy Mist will become its eyes.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When this happens, you'll want to focus on dodging the fire attacks from Misty Cloud. These often happen with him dragging the flaming bundle along the floor, to try and create a ripple of flames to get you. Or slamming it down like a hammer. There will be times when he puts the bundle on his back, and he's slow with this move, so you've got plenty of time to attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.

Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
