And just like his master, he’s incredibly ferocious, and it can be hard to anticipate his attacks, let alone whether he’ll attack with his very long sword or very long claws.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The battle will often begin with him lowering his sword, only to leap forward at blinding speed to attack with both sword and claw at once, rolling past you as he does, and then performing a follow up slash as he finishes his roll. This means you’ll want to dodge past him as he approaches, so you can safely distance yourself from the following slash and then attack him back.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
