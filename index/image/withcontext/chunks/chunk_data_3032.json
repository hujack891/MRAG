Clear out the foes, and then open it to find a **Copper Pill** Soak for your Gourd. This one in particular has an impressive effect to negate the cost of Rock Solid when used soon after using the gourd.\n\n\nOpen the large gate the Rat Imperial Guard were posted at, and head through to the other side. Be sure to look to the right as you open the gate, and you’ll find a tree with glowing flowers on it. Gather the **Luojia Fragrant Vine** , and be sure to return to the Shen Monkey later to improve your Gourd when you can!\n\nWatch out for another Lingzhiling in disguise nearby from the fragrant vine, and then travel up the path (check a small cave on the left for a green Wisp) and up to the Windrest Hamlet Shrine.\n\n\nShould you manage to best him in combat, he’ll offer to help you unlock this “Realm of Gold”, and open the doorway up the stairs that will lead you to another memory - a Secret Area known as the **Kingdom of Sahali**.\n\nWe highly recommend checking this place out before taking on the Chapter 2 Boss, as much like Chapter 1, its reward can greatly help you in that battle, and you’ll also find a Meditation Spot in this secret area!\n\n## Windseal Gate\n\nReturn to where you fought the King of Flowing Sand and his Second Prince son, and unlock the large stone door here. You’ll find stairs leading down here, with a spot to the left leading back to another door that’s actually a shortcut to the Valley of Despair’s cave where you fought the First Prince.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Further down the stairs, there’s a large broken building to the right, and a Spearbone guarding a rope bridge up ahead. New enemies are lurking underneath the ruined building — Weasel Captains.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
