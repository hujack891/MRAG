Similarly, you may want to rely on quick-hitting Spirits. Since you don’t get a different health bar like the Transformation Spells, there’s a good chance you may be stuck attacking right into a sword slash unless you time your Spirit attack well. In fact, a well-timed Earth Wolf Spirit can knock him right out of an attack and stagger him against a wall!\"\n            - Following Text: \"While you can use the new Azure Dust transformation, there’s a good chance he’ll keep staggering you before you can get many moves off, so it might be better to match his nimbleness with the Red Tides spell, and find a good time to dodge and unleash your ultimate attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
