Below you'll find a guide for the first upper area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find your first encounter with the Venom Daoist, and the different ways to reach The Verdure Bridge.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Upper Hollow**\n* **Pool of Shattered Jade**\n- Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nBefore following the golden trail of a nearby Shrine, look to the left of the bed and small chest to find a path leading to another larger **Treasure Chest** you can open to claim a **Cuo Jin-Yin Belt Hook Curio** , another item that can help resist all the poison you'll be encountering.\n\n## Upper Hollow\n\nGrab the green Wisp near where the archer was posted, and continue on through another large cave full of more cocoons, with some Puppet Ticks tending to them, and a few Wasp Guai stuck in the cocoons. They can be a little tricky to pin down with their constant darting around, so either bait them into diving into a Rock Solid, or use your Thrust or Pillar Stance to knock them out of the air.\"\n            - Following Text: \"As you near the end of the passage, keep your eyes on the right to spot a small alcove where the glow of a green Wisp will entice you over to investigate. There's a few Puppet Spiders waiting to ambush you when you draw close, however.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
