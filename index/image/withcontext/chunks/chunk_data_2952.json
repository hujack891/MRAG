Located at the end of the New Thunderclap Temple, you'll have to defeat him twice in a drawn out battle to claim the Sage's Relic he guards.\n\n* Rewards: Cosmo Radiance, Cold Iron Leaves x3, Fine Gold Thread x2, Gold Tree Core, Refined Iron Sand x2, Mind Core, 4330 Experience, 2267 Will\n\n\nAfter resting at the Mahavira Hall Shrine at the top of the stairs, be sure to take assessment of your gear. Cultivate your best Spirits, make sure you have a lot of pills on hand an craft a bunch of extra Shock-Quelling Powder (you're going to need it).\n\nYou should also have any anti-shock gear/curios/soaks on hand as well, along with whatever else can keep you alive for awhile. This final encounter is spread out into three distinct fights, and while you'll be able to respawn and pick up where you left off for the first two sections from the Shrine, the final section won't take you back to the Shrine.\n\n* First Encounter\n* Second Encounter\n\n\nYou'll need to defeat the Macaque Chief inside his magic sack to escape, whereupon you'll be transported to his floating shelf, and you'll be able to fight him one last time.\n\n## Yellowbrow Boss Fight (Second Encounter)\n\nThe scar will persist and continue to deal lightning damage if you walk too close to it, and as you learn this attack, you may want to try baiting him into slamming down in a corner to cover the least amount of ground.\n\nAmong his more familiar attacks, he can also detonate his mace after slamming into the ground after a short delay, so be ready if you notice the mace continue to glow (if it doesn't, you'll be a bit safer to engage near his weapon).\n\nOther times, these detonations can trigger a series of lightning bolts to explode outward around him, both spreading in a line from his strikes and also seeking you out.\"\n            - Following Text: \"This second fight is spaced into three phases, during which Yellowbrow will stop the fight momentarily to string you about like a rag doll. This means you can only take a third of his health bar off before he'll stop taking damage and stun you, which is worth noting so that you don't try and unleash a huge stored up attack when he's about to start a new phase.\n\nEven worse, when you take off the first third of his health, he'll stun you with electricity and then smack you around with his mace. This unavoidable cutscene actually takes off around 40% of your health, and is what we like to call a dick move.\n\nHe'll usually begin the next phase of the fight be performing another of his electrical cleaving attacks to tear another part of the ground, and with your low health, you'll need to quickly heal up or evade or risk an instant death!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
