Located at the end of the Forest of Wolves, this towering Wolf Guai will be your first true test for taking on very strong and very large boss enemies.\n\n* **Rewards:** Grey Wolf Mask, 3x Yarn, 1049 Experience, 702 Will\n\n\nThis tunnel will lead to a wooden path of scaffolding looping around to the temple entrance where this boss waits.\n\n## Lingxuzi Boss Fight and Guide\n\nSometimes, Lingxuzi can dive at you face first, moving his open jaws up before biting down. You need only dodge his face, meaning you can dodge right into his arms and keep attacking.\"\n            - Following Text: \"His most threatening attack comes when he disengages from the fight and jump to a nearby rooftop. He’ll jump around a bit, and then leap high into the air to bellyflop onto you, causing a large shockwave that you’ll need to time well and dodge or take a ton of damage.\n\nHe also has an uppercut grab he can sometimes employ after a dashing strike that’s hard to see coming, which can launch you into the air for a multi-hit attack that can deal a scary amount of damage. This move comes when he’s hunched over and growls, but he won’t raise his claw until it’s too late to dodge!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
