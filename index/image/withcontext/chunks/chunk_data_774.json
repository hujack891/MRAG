The leader of the Temple of Yellow Flowers and master of the Spider Guai, he is the final boss of the larger Webbed Hollow region.\n\n* Rewards: Golden Glowing Eye, Sky-Piercing Horn, Celestial Ribbon, Fine Gold Thread, Gold Tree Core, Kun Steel, Mind Core, 5329 Experience, 3693 Will\n\n\nThe Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master is a main Yaoguai King, and the final boss you'll encounter in Chapter 4. You'll find him by following the blood trail of the Crimson Spider through the Temple of Yellow Flowers.\n\nOnce you reach the Court of Illumination, you'll find a pathway to the right that leads to a large field where the final boss is located.\n\n## Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master Boss Fight and Guide\n\nHe'll then start coming for you while burrowed, which you can see by the disturbed earth heading in your direction. As lightning strikes, he'll leap out in an unblockable grab that deals major damage, and the timing can prove fairly difficult to dodge when you can't see or target him. We recommend running away while panning the camera behind you, and the exact moment you see a larger lightning strike behind you, dodge forward to avoid him as he bursts upward.\"\n            - Following Text: \"His other burrowing attack is equally damaging, though it comes less often. He'll start by tossing his sword at you, which will continue to spin wildly in a small circle near your position. As soon as you dodge it, immediately sprint away, as his tail will burst forth around the sword, spraying poison in nearly every direction.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
