Instead use your Cloud Step to get around and sneak attack.\n\n## Squall Hideout\n\n\nThe large cave entrance has a few paths, with the outer one on the right leading past another Pitstone to a wooden coffin chest holding 3 **Silk** and some **Will**.\n\n\nStart by luring the shieldless Spearbone out of range of the Blazebones above, then climb the stairs to rush down the projectile throwers. Be sure to look at the ruined home at the first landing below the first Blazebone for a yellow chest that has 2 **Yaoguai Core** and 3 **Tiny Piece of Gold**.\n\n\nAt the end of the crevice, you’ll find an unusual looking stone. He’s actually a Man-in-Stone, and claims to have been trapped within the rock form. He’s betting on one of the rock guai in the large cave nearby to hold the secrets to reversing his fate, and asks you to seek it out.\n\n\nAt the end of the cave path, you’ll find the object of the Man-in-Stone’s quest - an even larger statue embedded with shining blue crystals. Don’t get too enraptured that you miss a Poisestone along the walls trying to ambush you, though.\n\nUpon reaching the end of the large cave system where you’ll find the Mother of Stones, look for a large opening to the right to exit back outside and onto a cliff edge. There’s a raised platform here, and you’ll find another statue head to harvest its Buddha Eyeball.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Mother of Stones\n\nAfter taking enough damage, the Mother of Stones will let out a roar, signaling a Palestone will quickly appear to defend her. That’s your cue to immediately break off your attack, regain your stamina, and be ready to dodge the incoming stone monster. Survival will hinge on how well you can deal with each wave while taking minimal damage, and understanding their melee and ranged attacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once you’ve defeated two waves of single Palestones each, the third wave will consist of two Palestones at the same time. This can be a huge problem fast if they gang up on you with alternating attacks. Deflecting their ranged quartz missiles isn’t too bad… until you’re also dealing with one trying to body slam you.\n\nThis is the time to use everything in your arsenal to stay alive. Make sure you’re using your Spirit attacks to focus fire a target, unleash any stored Focus Points, and use Immobilize or Cloud Step to stay out of danger.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.

Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
