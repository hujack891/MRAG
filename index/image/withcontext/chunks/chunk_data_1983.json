Swift Bats are extremely fast and can be difficult to reach when they're up in the sky. You can expect to be swooped by the Swift Bat, hit with a volley of projectiles, or swiped at with the beast's clawed hands.\n\n## Swift Bat Spirit\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Wing Flapper**\n* Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Stamina recovery.\n\nThe Swift Bat's Spirit Power allows you to take the bat's form long enough to spread your massive wings and flap them, hitting your foe with a wave of stones kicked up from the ground. The damage caused by the Swift Bat's attack is decent, but it's not the most powerful Spirit by any means. The equipped effect, however, is extremely helpful and increases the rate at which your Stamina charges.\n\nStamina is required to complete combos, sprint, and jump in Black Myth: Wukong. It is quite an essential skill, so having something that boosts your Stamina recovery is very helpful.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
