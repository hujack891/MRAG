The Wight is much tougher than any other bosses you can fight this early in the game, and while it is still possible to defeat them early, it is highly recommended that you level up further before taking them on.\n\n* Rewards: Wandering Wight Spirit, Cat’s Eye Beads, Stone Spirit, 691 Will, 1,049 Experience\n\n\nYou can find him in the Forest of Wolves area by proceeding straight from the Outside the Forest Shrine, and past an axe-wielding Wolf Guai across a small bridge to a large clearing where the hulking giant patrols back and forth. Due to his staggering size, he’s hard to miss!\n\n## Wandering Wight Boss Fight and Guide\n\nEven worse, some of his combos can add with him performing an extremely fast leaping stomp attack, which covers a good amount of distance and is hard to react to when the speed is much faster than his other stomps.\"\n            - Following Text: \"However, the nastiest attack in the Wandering Wight’s disposal is easily his earthquake causing slam attack. If you see him wave his hands before holding one up in the air, be ready to dodge or start running away fast, as he’ll slam his fist into the ground and cause an explosion around him.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
