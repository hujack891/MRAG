Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine.

This is the third Poison Chief in the region.\n\nWhen you've beaten the third Poison Chief, head over to the start of the red trees. As you enter the clearing with the lightning, you'll find the next Keeper's Shrine on the left.\n\n## Deer Sight Forest\n\nActivate the Deer Sight Forest Keeper's Shrine and go toward the lightning and red tree in the middle of the clearing. Underneath the tree sits the Cloudtreading Deer.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Cloudtreading Deer\n\nThe Cloudtreading Deer will try to put as much distance as possible between you, so you'll want to use spells like Immobilize to keep it in place or Cloudstep to catch up to it. There are two phases to this fight, and aggression is key in the first one, so you can get to the second phase in as little time as possible with spells left over.\"\n            - Following Text: \"It will start by attacking with its horns, sweeping at you to try and hit you.
