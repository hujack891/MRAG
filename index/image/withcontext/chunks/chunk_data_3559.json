Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the grove and learning how to cultivate Spirits, accessing a secret realm, as well as how to defeat the many bosses of this area that include Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, Guangmou, and the Whiteclad Noble.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Back Hills**\n* **Snake Trail**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Guangmo\n* **Marsh of the White Mist**\n- Boss FIght - Whiteclad Noble\n\n\nTo advance, keep heading up the stairway to cross the high bridge over the falls, where you’ll soon see the golden trail of a nearby shrine beckoning you left. Before making that turn, be sure to look to the right to find a small wooden gazebo with a small table, and open the small gold box on top to find a variety of medicines, including 2 **Tiger Subduing Pellets** , 1 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 1 **Amplification Pellet**.\n\n\nAnother good strategy to note is that if you’re in danger of getting close to becoming poisoned, using the Red Tides spell can help you transform out of danger. Any status effects suffered while transformed as Guangzhi will be removed when you regain your regular health bar. As an added bonus, Guangmou will even comment on your transformation.\n\nOnce you’ve learned how to evade his projectiles, the rest of the fight will just boil down to chasing him down and stunning him however you can with Immobilize, your Spirit Attack, and other heavy hits. When he falls, you’ll gain Guangmou’s Spirit to add to your collection, allowing you to summon venomous snakes of your own!\n\n\nWhen you’re ready to move on, make sure you’re fully healed up from dealing with that snake, as the end of this downward path leads to the titular marsh where a very strong boss waits to block your path.\n\n## Boss Fight - Whiteclad Noble\n\nAt range, he may do a backwards twirl, but this is only to prepare a very fast spear throw in your direction. Dodge to the side and prepare for him to follow his spear, grabbing onto the embedded weapon and spin around it to launch himself at you once more feet first, and then one final lunge with his spear for a third and final strike.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Even more deadly is his ability to begin twirling his spear as you can your staff — only his version will kick up thin waves of water to send your way. He’ll send about 6 damaging projectile waves this way, and then charge up for a lunging thrust to follow up with. You can simply strafe and outpace the waves of force, and ready yourself to dodge his thrust before countering.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
