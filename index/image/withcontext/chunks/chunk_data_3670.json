Unlike the other Spirits that cost Will and eventually a Knot of Voidness to upgrade, Baw-Li-Guhh-Yang requires Tadpoles. There are six frog bosses in Black Myth: Wukong, and each one yields a Tadpole when defeated.\n\n**There is one frog boss in each chapter. You must defeat all of them to collect enough Tadpoles to fully upgrade Baw-Li-Guh-Yang and unlock Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang.**\n\nSpirits can be upgraded at any Keeper's Shrine by selecting _Cultivate Spirits_!\n\n## Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang Spirit\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Tongue Whip**\n* Equipped Effect: Moderately reduces the Stamina cost for Jumps and Jump Attacks.\n\nBaw-Baw-Lang-Lang's Spirit allows you to embody one of five frogs, each with their own elemental attack. There is a poison frog, a thunder frog, a fire frog, an ice frog, and a stone frog. You won't know what frog you are going to get each time you use the move, but each frog has an excellent attack that deals a fair amount of damage. Channeling Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang also reduces the Stamina cost for Jumping, including Jump Attacks. The Jump Heavy Attack is a quick and effective way to land a strong hit, and this Spirit makes that move even less demanding.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
