Hiding across several rope bridges outside the middle of the Webbed Hollow, this boss can't be activated until you obtain a Key Item in the previous chapter. Yellow Loong is the final of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n\n* Rewards: Golden Lining Transformation Spell, Sea-Supporting Tendon, Golden Carp Curio, Kun Steel, Loong Pearl, Mind Core, 6998 Experience, 5049 Will\n\n\nYou can enter the crack in the wall, and on the other side you’ll find a chest containing the Loong Scales. With this item, you’ll be able to unlock the boss.\n\n## Yellow Loong Boss Fight and Guide\n\nOnce you take off a good chunk of his health, the second \"phase\" will start, and things get extremely dangerous. It will begin when he stops fighting to charge up and release a blast of electricity around him.\n\nAfter he does this, he'll immediately fly at you low to the ground with a slash while imbued by electricity that is incredibly quick and hard to dodge -- and it only gets worse from here.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He'll spend the next several attacks floating up above you and dive-bombing in his electrified state, and though each dive-bomb looks the same, the timing is slightly different depending on his motions before attacking:\n\nTwirling his glaive over his head will buy you a second until he finishes the animation before flying at you, but if he holds his glaive pointed behind him, you'll have the smallest of moments to dodge before he charges you. He may also hold his weapon under his other arm, or angle it downward, and each has its own timing.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
