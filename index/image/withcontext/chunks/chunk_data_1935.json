Hidden beyond a waterfall of sand in the Fright Cliff, you won't be able to encounter this boss until you obtain a Key Item elswhere in this chapter, Black Loong is one of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n\n* **Rewards:** Tridacna Pendant, Thunderbone, Loong Pearl x1, Refined Iron Sand x2, Mind Core x1\n\n\nWith the Loong Scales, you'll be able to interact with the sandfall and remove it as a barrier, revealing a door behind it to take you into the Black Loong's lair.\n\n## Black Loong Boss Fight and Guide\n\nIf you spot the Black Loong raising his weapons high in a slow manner while they crackle to life, it’s a sign he’s going to bang them together slowly three times, causing explosions in the air that gradually increase in range. This is a good time to sprint to safety and use your medicines while you wait for the attack to end.\"\n            - Following Text: \"However, the most dire of his attacks will come when he seems to emit even more electricity coming from his mouth and arcing around his body. Listen carefully to the drumbeat of the music, as he’ll start to pound the very earth in time with the drum beats, causing several rings of electric energy to expel outward.\n\nGetting hit by even a few of these will quickly deplete your healthbar, and you’ll have to stop everything to focus on evasion. While it is possible to get on top of your staff in the Pillar Stance, each electric ring will take a chunk out of your stamina, and this segment lasts far too long to wait out in this style.\n\nYou need to also be ready for his final slam, which he’ll do with both weapons, but won’t send out a ring. He’s being sneaky here to lure you into advancing on him, but will detonate his weapons after a pause to send out one final quick electric ring!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
