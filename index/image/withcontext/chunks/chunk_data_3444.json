This is the second duo of chiefs you'll fight in Chapter 5 and they'll try a number of tricks to disappear right before your eyes.\n\n\nAs soon as you pass through the archway, the next boss battle will begin and you'll discover who was responsible for the voices you heard earlier.\n\n## Cloudy Mist, Misty Cloud Boss Fight and Guide\n\nAs Cloudy Mist is the first to appear, this should be where you first attack. Things will change when you manage to hit Cloudy Mist enough times that it will send out a bright light as a flashbang that can stun both you and Misty Cloud. For a brief moment, Misty Cloud won't be able to see you and Cloudy Mist will become its eyes.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When this happens, you'll want to focus on dodging the fire attacks from Misty Cloud. These often happen with him dragging the flaming bundle along the floor, to try and create a ripple of flames to get you. Or slamming it down like a hammer. There will be times when he puts the bundle on his back, and he's slow with this move, so you've got plenty of time to attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
