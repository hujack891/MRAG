The leader of the Spider Guai and master of The Webbed Hollow, the Violet Spider and her six daughters control this region, and their mother has particular plans for the pig known as Zhu Bajie.\n\n* Rewards: Spider Leg, Refined Iron Sand, 3410 Experience, 2608 Will\n\n\nThe Violet Spider is a required and non-missable boss in Chapter 4. She is the final boss of the Webbed Hollow Section, and must be defeated to progress to the next area. After you have reached the Lower Hollow and defeated Zhu Bajie to free him of his bewitching curse, he'll be abducted again.\n\nTo reach him (and the Violet Spider), you'll need to ascend the Purfiying Spring outside the Hut of Immortality, and follow the trail upwards to The Gathering Cave where the spider queen awaits you.\n\n## Violet Spider Boss Fight and Guide\n\nAt this point, her eyes will start to glow, signifying her second phase. Things will get very scary if her eyes start to glow even brighter and mesmerize you.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If this happens, you'll suddenly be transported to an illusory realm where you're on a bed of webs instead of solid ground. This can get extremely bad as the more you move around, the more you'll be slowed until eventually you'll be exposed as you try and break free of the webbing.\n\nExpect the Violet Spider to absolutely take advantage of your vulnerability in these moments, attacking with both her talons and a large jump slam attack that even staggers her for a bit. You'll need to stand your ground and use Rock Solid to knock away her blasts if you're unable to dodge them in time.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
