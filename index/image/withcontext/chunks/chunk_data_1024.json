With a loud gong, the trapped \"Admiral\" will use the cymbal to awaken a giant turtle whose mountainous shell you're actually standing on.\n\nAs the turtle begins to swim through the Bitter Seal, the woman will become aware of your presence, starting this new region off with a bang of a boss fight.\n\n\nAs long as your patient to wait for the right moments to get in close and attack, and make sure you're using shock-quelling medicine, you'll be able to come out on top. Even as Kang-Jin Star tries to flee in her dragon form, the Destined One will see to it that she crashes into the large cymbals, freeing the prisoner inside!\n\nThis imprisoned Pig Guai is none other than Zhu Bajie, who traveled with Sun Wukong during his adventures in Journey to the West!\n\n\nAs you start exploring the path over to the right, an echoing voice will lead you to a large open platform where dragon humanoid figure appears to be frozen in place with its fishing rod. If you interact with it while holding the Loong Scales, it will crackle to life, and begin a new secret boss fight.\n\n\nWhen he falls, you'll earn some Fine Gold Thread and another Loong Pearl, and can loot a nearby chest that appears for the Mountain-Shaking Claw material and Breath of Fire Soak for your Gourd. This new material will unlock the upgrade path for your Loongwreathe Staff into the Golden Loong Staff, but you'll need to find and defeat the last of the four Loongs to craft it.\n\nOnce you've had your fill of exploring the \"Turtle Island\", you can head to the front where the small Pig Guai stands waiting, and interact with him for the turtle to finally make its landing at the next part of the Bitter Lake.\n\n\nStart by heading along the shore and defeating various Frozen Corpses, and look for a small building in the distance by the water's edge. As you near it, you can also spot a dragon man standing alone in the shallows. Zhu Bajie seems to know him, but as you approach, you'll be pulled into another boss fight.\n\n## Boss Fight - Chen Loong\n\nHis strongest attack by far is when he jumps into the air with his green weapon, charging it with energy before crashing down with it. It will cause a huge electrical explosion when he lands, but then spread outward with several lighting strikes that cover a wide area.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The second hit can be extremely tough to dodge, but using the Pillar Stance to get off the ground can soak the blow if you have stamina to spare (though it will probably still stun you).\n\nRemember that you also have Zhu Bajie as an ally in this fight, and while he won't be able to hold his attention for too long, but he can be useful at giving you some breathing room or interrupting attacks.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
