Located near the end of the Fright Cliff area, imposing Rock Guai sports a formidable defense and exploding attacks.\n\n* **Rewards:** Sterness of Stone, Mind Core x1, Yaoguai Core x2, 1652 Experience, 1366 Will\n\n\nLook for an archway on the left wall in this area to find this boss arena.\n\n## Stone Vanguard Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe Stone Vanguard is one of two bosses you must defeat to advance to the end of Chapter 2, and defeating it is no easy task. As a hulking monster of rock, the Stone Vanguard employs lots of tremor attacks and huge shockwaves whenever it slams its giant front arms down — which is most of the time. Cloud Step can be very useful for getting out of the way of incoming leaps, and then blindsiding it from the side to stagger it off of its current attack.\n\n### Secret - Get Help from the Shigandang\n\nIf you watch him raise both arms to the side in a half-swing motion, he’ll begin to stab the ground repeatedly, alternating his arms four times, before raising both arms high for a ground-bursting blast with both of his arms.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Finally, the Stone Vanguard has a rather unique attack signaled by him tapping the ground repeatedly with one arm. This will summon a horde of Rock Guai to burrow up out of the ground and launch themselves at you in a steady succession, exploding on impact. You’ll need to either backpedal and take evasive action, or use Cloud Step to get the slip on them. Be warned that as the last two make their leap attack, the Stone Vanguard will join in requiring you to time your evasion right.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
