As you near it, you can also spot a dragon man standing alone in the shallows. Zhu Bajie seems to know him, but as you approach, you'll be pulled into another boss fight.\n\n## Boss Fight - Chen Loong\n\nReturn to Chen Loong (who now stands outside the shack by the water), and deliver the pellet to him. The old dragon will be overjoyed at your gift, and in return will pass along The Ruyi Scroll to you. He'll proclaim that he now has the strength to unseal the Painted Realm, where he and his fellow deities will now reside -- and you're invited!\n\n### The Zodiac Village of the Painted Realm\n\nUp ahead, you'll spot another of the lesser Apramana Bats skulking about a curved skeletal piece, and nestled within is a **Treasure Chest** that holds some materials.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Another bat is hiding up ahead on the left in front of a Celestial Pear Tree, but with its back turned you can sneak up and unleash a charged strike first -- so long as you watch out for the Frozen Corpses around it.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
