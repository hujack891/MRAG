This character will ask you to complete a side quest for him that will unlock Chapter 2’s Secret Area: The Kingdom of Sahali.\n\n\nIn this large open field, you’ll find a friendly boar-like Guai resting on a rock. He’s apparently extremely inebriated, and needs you to help him find something to sober him up. He’ll mention “**Windrest** ” if you talk to him again, providing a clue to where you can find such an ingredient.\n\n\nOn the left side when looking at the large building, defeat a Blazebone monster, and then look to the right for a **small alcove** , where you can spot a **glowing pot**. Break the pot, and you’ll find the **Sobering Stone**.\n\n\nThis “senior brother” is the First Prince of Flowing Sands — aka the giant rat Yaoguai Chief that you can fight in the **Valley of Despair** on the road from Sandgate Village to the **Crouching Tiger Temple**. If you didn’t kill the rat king, **he’ll summon the prince to fight you**. Otherwise, you can use the **Pungent Flesh Chunk** to summon and defeat him yourself.\n\nHe’ll drop the **Arhat Gold Piece** when defeated, which is the gold the Boar needs.\n\n\nThough he doesn’t say where he’s going, the Boar will actually return to **near where you first met him** at the **Rockrest Flat** area of the Fright Cliff. However, instead of sitting on a rock, he’ll now be standing over by the stairs leading to a large door you can’t access yet.\n\nUnfortunately, he’s not too pleased that you’re in possession of the gold, and the Yellow-Robed Squire will challenge you to a duel!\n\n## Boss Fight - Yellow-Robed Squire\n\nIf you notice him throw out sand and then raise his hand high while it begins to glow, be ready for him to summon his secret weapon — a large bladed ring with barbs that he can employ for the rest of his combo.\n\nCertain times, he’ll start with a large downward slash, and then follow up after a delay with a second jumping slash attack, and then one final pivoting slash attack before it disappears into sand. As his health gets slower, he’ll add summoning the ring blade to his other combo attacks, but they can still be parried with Rock Solid.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If you try to pull back too far away from him, he also has a few more sandy surprises. Instead of crafting a ring blade, he can also summon a spear of sand behind his back that glows as it appears, and then he’ll launch it at you extremely fast.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
