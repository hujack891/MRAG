Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby.\n\n\nAs you get close to the edge of the cliff, you'll find another clearing with a rock in the middle. This is the third Poison Chief in the region.\n\nWhen you've beaten the third Poison Chief, head over to the start of the red trees. As you enter the clearing with the lightning, you'll find the next Keeper's Shrine on the left.\n\n## Deer Sight Forest\n\nActivate the Deer Sight Forest Keeper's Shrine and go toward the lightning and red tree in the middle of the clearing. Underneath the tree sits the Cloudtreading Deer.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Cloudtreading Deer\n\nIn this first phase, you'll want to have plenty of Body-Warming Powder, as the Cloudtreading Deer uses frost as its elemental attacks. But the most dangerous aspect of this first stage is the fact that the deer sends out lots of little tornadoes. While the small whirlwinds of ice are easy to dodge, these tornadoes are much harder to avoid and also signal when the deer will ramp up its attacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"To make the first part of this fight easier, we'd recommend equipping the Wind Tamer as your vessel. It will wipe these tornadoes out as soon as you use it, and mean there's one less thing to focus on. The deer will still leap in the air and tread the clouds to attack you, but you won't need to worry about being hit by the annoying tornadoes. While this is useful once, you'll obviously need to wait for it to become available again, and in the meantime, the deer will continue to use this attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
