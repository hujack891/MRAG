You'll need to break him out of the cocoon, and then defeat this boss (attacking his back to destroy his extra hands will deal major damage and can end the fight early).\n\nOnce defeated, he'll vow revenge and flee, and you won't see him again until escaping the Webbed Hollow.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
