Heavy Attacks work a bit differently here than in most other games: The more you land hits, the more your Focus bar in the bottom right corner grows. When it fills, you’ll gain a Focus Point, which allows you to add a Heavy Attack into your Light Attack Combos for massive damage. While you can still perform a Heavy Attack on its own, it will lack added punch without that Focus Point, and can’t be included in a combo attack without it.\n\nAlternatively, you can simply hold the Heavy Attack button to begin charging up your Focus, and letting go of the button will unleash the attack, which can be devastating on slow or unsuspecting enemies. It’s important to note that Focus won’t decay from performing light attacks, but you can’t keep the Focus from charging up, so knowing when to use which type of heavy attack can prove useful.\n\nHead up the stone stairway into a narrow path full of boulders, where the path splits in two:\"\n            - Following Text: \"The route on the left leads down to a Wolf Scout guarding a small gold chest, which contains 5 **Tiny Piece of Gold** \\- an item that can be sold at shops to earn more Will.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
