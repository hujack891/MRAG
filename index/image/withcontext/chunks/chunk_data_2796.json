Located at the end of the Bamboo Grove, he is not listed as a Yaoguai Boss, but is akin to a end-of-area Yaoguai King, and even has two boss phases you'll need to survive.\n\n* **Rewards:** Jade Fang, 3x Yarn, 1049 Experience, 688 Will\n\n\nAs a required boss, you can't miss running into this character when exploring Black Wind Mountain. You'll find him guarding the end of the Marsh of White Mist in the Bamboo Grove, past where you save and befriend the Shen Monkey that can upgrade your Gourd.\n\nYou'll find him at the bottom of the ramp across a large flooded marsh area lined with reeds.\n\n## Whiteclad Noble Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThis snake-like noble will attempt to test your resolve, and he’s got the skills to back it up, so don’t take this boss lightly. Oddly enough, despite his appearance, he doesn’t employ any poison attacks, so having the Celestial Lotus Seeds as your gourd’s Soak is the better option for this fight.\n\nThe Whiteclad Noble opts instead to attack with his strong spear, and can harness the power of water itself to amplify its reach. He’ll use it often to create waves of watery force you’ll need to dodge or suffer a lot of damage from. He’s also not above simply tossing his spear at you, and then calling it back to his hand.\"\n            - Following Text: \"This boss usually begins the battle with a jumping lunge attack, but is also highly mobile and will retreat without warning to reposition himself. Get your hits in when able, but be wary as you pursue his retreats. His jumping lunge can be used when he dodges and strafes around you, so be on your guard whenever he starts to move around the arena quickly.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
