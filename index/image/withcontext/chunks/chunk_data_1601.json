This agile fighter will use flames and duplicates to try and overwhelm you during this heated altercation at the end of the chapter.\n\n\nRed Boy can be found toward the end of Chapter 5, by following the main path. Head up the slope to see Pingping speak to her father. The Bull King isn't best pleased with The Destined One, but also has an issue with Pingping and her deception. It turns out that Pingping is actually the Red Boy, and he will transform before your eyes, ready for a battle.\n\n## Red Boy Boss Fight and Guide\n\nWhen he winds his staff to create a ring of fire, the attack looks a lot worse than it actually is. He'll throw out the ring toward you and it will start to bounce around the clearing. Keep track of it by looking up and following it to stay away from where it lands. If you keep moving, it's fairly easy to avoid. After bouncing around a few times, the Red Boy will slam down into the ground to recover the spear. There's a brief pause here while he composes himself, so you'll be able to rush in to attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If he performs the combination of moves where he twirls the spear around him, he'll perform a leap and thrust his spear into the ground, then flip toward you. When he does this, he'll follow it up immediately with a flamethrower from his hand. It's best to dodge all of this moveset, then attack.\n\nThough it's tempting to create distance, it's better to stay close to the Red Boy during this fight. Not only will this allow you to take advantage of those pauses we mentioned previously, but it also means he's less likely to use projectiles. If you're too far away, he'll shoot fire along the ground to try and reach you.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
