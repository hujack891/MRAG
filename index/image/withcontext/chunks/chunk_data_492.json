As an optional foe, you can seek out this boss in the Yellow Wind Formation through one of three possible entrances to where the Chapter Boss resides behind sealed stone gates.\n\n* Rewards: Gore-Eye Daoist Spirit\n\n## Where to Find the Gore-Eye Daoist\n\nHowever, in order to open the door, you will need both the Sterness of Stone from the Stone Vanguard Boss, and Keeness of Tiger from the Tiger Vanguard Boss. With both Key Items, you'll be able to interact with the Tally in front of the door and open it, and you'll find the boss after crossing a bridge down to the Windseal Gate.\n\n### Gore-Eye Daoist Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe most annoying part will be when he hunches over and starts to mumble. Lines of red will start appearing from the eyes on his back toward each of the blood pools he’s created, and will essentially suck the pools back in and regenerate a portion of health. Stop him the moment you see this with a well timed Immobilize, or try a Spirit with a mighty attack to stagger him out of it, otherwise the fight will just go on longer.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Try to keep him boxed in if possible — getting his back stuck to a wall can severely limit how much blood he can expel from his eyeballs, and stop the projectiles from seeking you out. Use stunning, staggering, and heavy hits to keep him off-balance and unable to cast his spells, and he’ll fall before long.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
