Below, you'll find a Walkthrough for the first major area of The Flaming Mountains called Woods of Ember, as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* ** **Ashen Pass I\n- Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Brown-Iron Cart\n* **Camp of Seasons**\n* **Height of Ember**\n- Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones\n- Yoaguai Chief - Gray-Bronze Cart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind\n* **Ashen Pass II**\n\n\nInstead of finding him wherever you left him kneeling, you'll now see him by the edge of the cliff. As you come back down the stairs to the area where you fought him, you'll see a small set opposite with two Buddha statues on either side. Go up these and to the left, to find him overlooking the mountain. Talk to him and exhaust any new dialogue.\n\n\nAt the top, a Lavabat will attack you as soon as you reach the area. On the right, you'll find another Bull Sergeant and two more Revenant Charbones. Clear this and then activate the **Height of Ember Keeper's Shrine** near the tree on the right.\n\n## Height of Ember\n\nLook to the right of the Keeper's Shrine to find a green Wisp to absorb. Once you've collected it, continue along the path from the Shrine, toward the open space on the left. When you reach a certain point, the Father of Stones miniboss will jump over the wall near the door on the right.\n\n### Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones\n\nFollow the path to the left and toward the cave at the end of it. Just before you get there, you'll see another green Wisp to be collected to the left. Once you've grabbed it, head inside the cave.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The cave is very dark, but you'll be able to see the faint glow of a green Wisp to the left and lava to the right. Head for the lava, to find a Revenant Charbone, but also a pathway that leads outside.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
