You’ll also meet the owner of the voice on the wind - the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain.\n\nThis friendly guy will be your guide and mentor for this part of the world, and will bid you to set out in search of Guanyin Temple, which burned down long ago but has since been rebuilt - but not by human hands. As the Keeper departs, he’ll bestow you with the Incense Trail Talisman, which can let you warp back to the last Shrine you rested at.\n\n\nOpposite the balcony, you can spot some torches marking a tunnel passage into the rocks. Delve inside to find a familiar golden trail leading to the next Shrine. Now that you’ve grown, so to has the Shrine’s options, as you’ll be able to set Spells to your quickbar, reset your Skill Tree if you wish to experiment, and start buying and selling things at the store:\n\nBlack Wind Mountain Shrine Store\n| Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store          | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store    | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store  | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store |\n| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| Evil Repelling Medicament (x3) - 270 Will | Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Antimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will |                                  |\n| Yarn (x4) - 300 Will                      | Stone Spirit (x4) - 450 Will        |                                   |                                  |\n| Aged Ginseng (x5) - 90 Will               | Purple Lingzhi (x5) - 90 Will       | Gentian (x5) - 90 Will            | Jade Lotus (x5) - 90 Will        |\n| Snake-Head Mushroom (x5) - 120 Will       |                                     |                                   |                                  |\n\nSince you can’t craft medicine yet, you probably don’t need to be buying ingredients, but the medicines offered here are fairly rare to find in this chapter, so it won’t hurt to buy a few of each, and then sell any Pieces of Gold you’ve found.\n\n\nPick up the fiery blade, and you’ll learn a Transformation Spell: **Red Tides**. Now you’ll be able to transform into the very boss you defeated, and use his own abilities in combat against your enemies.\n\nTransformation Spells are very powerful, and essentially give you a separate health and might bar to work with. Might will decay fairly quickly over time, and even more if you charge up the transformation’s focus bar to employ special spell attacks. For this particular spell, you’ll be able to use Guangzhi’s spinning light attacks, and charge a heavy attack for his quick dashes. With a full focus bar, you can use Might on spell after dodging to employ his powerful pogo jump attack!\n\n## Black Wind Mountain’s Secret - Ringing the First Bell\nWith Guangzhi defeated, you can look where he was meditating to find a large bell. Interact with the pole to ring the bell. The Keeper will fret over this, but in reality this is the first of three bells you should seek out in Chapter 1 to uncover a major secret!\n\nBe sure to check around the boss arena for pots to break, some **Aged Ginseng** , and another green wisp that flies away while only granting you a small amount of Will.\"\n            - Following Text: \"With the Red Tides spell, you can try your luck against the Wandering Wight mini-boss next, or slip past him to find a tunnel beyond and return to him later once we can actually make use of the reward for defeating him.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
