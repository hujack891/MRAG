The Soak's ability is strong, useful for almost any build.\n\nWith the Turtle Tear Soak equipped, when at full health, using the gourd recovers a moderate amount of mana.\n\nSoaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor.\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Turtle Tear Location\n\nInteract with this skeleton to spawn the Soak back on the shoreline by Turtle Island.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Soaks are far more plentiful than the drinks for your gourds.
