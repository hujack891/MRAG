Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby.\n\n## Rhino Watch Slope\n\nIn the midst of the trees, there's a small patch of ground with no grass. The Poison Chief can be found here.\n\n\nThankfully, each of the Poison Chief fights is pretty much the same. You can expect the same moveset and should prepare for them in the same way.\n\nWhen the second Poison Chief is down, return to the Rhino Watch Slope and then head into the area with the flames on the ground. A cutscene will play out as you get there, and the Gold Armored Rhino will appear.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Gold Armored Rhino\n\nThough you can do damage by hitting the Rhino in other areas, there’s little point in doing so unless you want the fight to last a long time. If you miss hitting the horn, you can still attack it. Avoid hitting its face and instead focus on hitting it from behind. This will annoy it, and it will buck to try and kick you with its back legs.\n\nBut if you’re holding charge to build it up, wait until the Rhino is coming toward you or pauses for a moment, and then unleash the attack. One of the best times to hit is when it's moving slowly, with sparks appearing around its horn.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Unfortunately, it won't be very long until lots of lightning starts to appear around the Rhino. When this happens, it will rear up and more lightning will start to strike the ground all around the field. This means that the horn is about to regrow, and you'll need to prepare to break it again.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
