Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Ashen Pass III**\n- Boss Fight - Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n* **Cooling Slope**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n- Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\n* **Fallen Furnace Crater**\n- Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n- Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\n\nAfter defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the Yin-Yang Fish, and the Crimson-Silver Cart, you'll have climbed to the top of the Flaming Mountains and be closer to finding out where the Bull King is.\n\n\nThe gauntlet is almost over! As you continue on, there's a small gap on the left you can dart into and then it's onward toward the flames. When you approach, a cutscene will begin where you'll see the golden spiked ball go flying off the end of the cliff.\n\nAfter the cutscene, ignore Pingping running off, and turn back to where you came from. Remember the wall of flames? Head back there. Now that the ball is gone, it's safe to explore the area slowly and you'll find the flames have also disappeared. A path has been revealed, which is the Cooling Slope, and the next place we'll explore.\n\n## Cooling Slope\n\nAs you enter the Cooling Slope for the first time, there are two points of interest to take note of. Up ahead, there's a smattering of rocks. And to the left, there's a Luoija Fragrant Vine.\n\nIf you hug the rocks to the left, you can collect the Luoija Fragrant Vine safely, but be careful as a Searing-Fire will leap out at you as you get close to it.\n\nThen, you'll want to go over to that collection of rocks. When you approach, it will transform into your first miniboss of the region, which is the Flint Vanguard.\n\n\nTop Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top Spirit\n\n\nThis is actually where you can summon a miniboss called the Mother of Flamlings, and to do so, all you need to give over is 4x Flame Ores. Thankfully, Flame Ores are dropped by Flamlings, so you'll hopefully have enough by this point to summon her immediately. Approach the glowing patch and deliver the Flame Ores.\n\n\nGo past the lone Searing-Fire rock and you'll reach the Cooling Slope Keeper's Shrine. Keep going forward past the Keeper's Shrine and look to the right. You'll see an icy archway, and a clear just before it. Head over here, past the Scorching-Fire rocks, and you'll come face to face with the final of the Five Element Carts.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\n\nWhen you've beaten the final cart, you'll receive the Flame Orb Curio. Head over to the area on the right before the doorway and speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart one final time.\n\nAfter the conversation and the cutscene, you can then approach the frozen-over entrance and break through to head inside.\n\nThis doorway will take you to the chapter's secret area called the Bishui Cave. We'd recommend completing this before you finish up the chapter. But there's one last miniboss to fight before you teleport to the secret area.\"\n            - Following Text: \"As you head inside the cave, go down the slope. You'll see a large structure in the center of the room that's being hit by the light. This is what will teleport you to Bishui Cave, but first, you'll want to look to the left. Here you can find the fifth of the frog bosses in the game, called Baw-Lang-Lang.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
