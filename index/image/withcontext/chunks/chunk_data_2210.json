You can easily fall off the bridge during the fight, causing you to die immediately. That makes it much more tricky than a battle on solid ground.\n\nThe Tiger's Acolyte is very fast and very strong. Immobilize will be a big help here, as will perfect dodging. The longer you tussle on the bridge, the more chance you have of falling off. Pull out all your spells in this fight to defeat him as quickly as possible.\n\n## Tiger's Acolyte Spirit\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Sharp Edge**\n* Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Critical Damage.\n\nThe Tiger's Acolyte is an incredibly strong enemy that lends you an equally strong attack when his Spirit is equipped. It only deals a single instance of damage, but the amount of damage is decent. It also allows you to close the distance between you and your foe much faster than sprinting over there yourself. The Tiger's Acolyte significantly increases your Critical Damage when equipped. To make the most of this effect, head to the skill tree and increase your chances of landing a Critical Hit.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
