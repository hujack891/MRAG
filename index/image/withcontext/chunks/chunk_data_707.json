If you want to be able to access this, there are actions you'll need to take early on in the level, which involve defeating the Venom Doaist mini-boss. Want to know the right path to follow in the Webbed Hollow to get started? Here's how to do it.\n\n* How to Find the Venom Daoist\n* How to Find the Venom Daoist for the Second Time\n\n\nAt the end of this fight, you can potentially receive the Venomous Armguard, but you'll need to approach the fight in a specific way to achieve this. The Venom Daoist has 6 arms on his back, and you'll need to break the bottom 4 for him to drop the armguards. If you kill him before doing this, he won't drop anything. Use the lowest damage weapon that you have, and focus your attacks on his back. If you're having trouble with it, use Immobolize to keep him still.\n\n## How to Find the Venom Daoist for the Second Time\n\nIn order to unlock the secret area for Chapter 4, you'll need to find the Venom Daoist again. Once you've beaten him for the first time, continue to play on through the chapter until you get to the Temple of Yellow Flowers.
