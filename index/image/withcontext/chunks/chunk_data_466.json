With it activated, you can transform into Yellow Loong, gaining immunity to Shock and the ability to see through the enemy. Each attack also inflicts Thunder Bane. Any Focus built up before transformation can be converted for use afterwards.\n\nThis is one of the longest quest chains to obtain a Transformation, reliant on your defeating the four Loongs throughout the game with the Loong Scales. Golden Lining's moveset is as follows:\n\n* **Light Attack: Lightning Dance - Dance with a blade of lightning and slash repeatedly.** This is a powerful light attack that can be chained together to deal consistent damage and build Focus.\n* **Heavy Attack: Fatal Shadow - Charges and executes a fatal attack.** This is a strong, regular charged attack.\n* **Charged Heavy Attack: Death Trilogy - Cause massive damage by launching up to 3 successive attacks at proper times.** This attack is a strong chain attack that requires precise timing to make the most of it. Each slam consumes one Focus Point.\n* **Combo Attack: Unscathed - See through the enemy's move and counterattack, building up 1 Focus Point.** When attacking, and any time your enemy also attacks during this combo, you can see through their move and perform a powerful counterattack.\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Golden Lining Location\n\nYou can then use these scales on the sand waterfall in Fright Cliff in Yellow Wind Ridge to fight Black Loong.\n\nSecondly, head to the Forest of Wolves in Black Wind Mountain and head through the waterfall to defeat Red Loong.\n\nFinally, once you reach Turtle Island in the Bitter Lake in The New West, head to the right side of the island to activate the Cyan Loong fight.\n\nWith these three fights completed, you now need to wait until you enter Chapter 4 - The Webbed Hollow. While exploring, you will stumble upon the Relief of the Fallen Loong and Yellow Loong past the rope bridges in the middle of the hollow.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once defeated, the boss will drop the Golden Lining Transformation spell.
