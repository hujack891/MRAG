The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems.\n\n\nAs you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple. A long slope here will send you down to a large arena, and its here you'll have your second and final encounter with an old foe - the Venom Daoist.\n\n\nBefore you do, you should also head through the nearby gateway to find a large field with a giant tree in the middle. Off on the right, you can find a wooden ledge overlooking the mountains with a **Treasure Chest** full of random materials and a Soul Remigration Pill.\n\n## Court of Illumination\n\nNow at the Court of Illumination Shrine, you'll find a pathway straight ahead, and another to the right leading to a large field. The doorway to the right leads to the final boss, so first take a quick detour up the stairs.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Up ahead, you'll find the final purple talisman altar, but before you approach it, look off to the left for a higher pathway guarded by two Sword Daoists. Defeat them and travel through the narrow rocky passageway up to a landing with a **Treasure Chest** that should contain a Knot of Voidness, Loong Aura Amplification Pellet and Life-Saving Pill, or other materials.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
