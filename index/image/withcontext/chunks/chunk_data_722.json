The Five Element Carts guard passages throughout the Flaming Mountains, but you'll need to beat four of them if you want to enter Bishui Cave. Here's everything you need to know to complete this questline, including a detailed walkthrough below.\n\n1. Defeat the Pale-Axe Stalwart\n2. Defeat the Brown-Iron Cart\n3. Defeat Gray-Bronze Cart\n4. Speak to Pale-Axe Stalwart Again\n5. Defeat Crimson-Silver Cart\n6. Find the Cooling Slope\n7. Defeat Rusty-Gold Cart\n8. Speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart One More Time\n\n\nExhaust all the dialogue you can with him. He'll mention some coffin carts that blocked the passes called the \"Five Elements Carts\" and ask you to destroy them. He'll also tell you that there's more to them than just guarding the passes, so you'd better check them out!\n\n\nAs you go up the stairway past the Pale-Axe Stalwart, you'll be quickly met with the first of the carts, which is the Brown-Iron Cart. It doesn't have great variation in attacks, so try to stick to near its arms instead of its head to avoid the continuous fire attacks. Then, just watch out for when it slams its fists down, and dodge these attacks. The Fireproof Mantle Vessel will help hugely here if you have it and for the rest of the bosses in this questline.\n\n\nYou can expect the same moveset from each of the carts, so again, the Fireproof Mantle Vessel works wonders here. For this one, though, you won't be able to get close to the feet and stay there without being hit with the fire attacks. So, stick close during the fist slam (without the fire) and dodge this. But when it rears up, jump back into the alcove to protect yourself from any fire attacks.\n\n\nThe Pale-Axe Stalwart will move after you defeat the Brown-Iron Cart and Gray-Bronze Cart (as long as you've exhausted his dialogue). He'll appear as a marker next to the Keeper's Shrine called Camp of Seasons, which is the shrine that was unlocked after defeating Brown-Iron Cart.\n\nHowever, you can find him near where you first met him. He'll just be standing near the edge of the cliff. You'll get some more information from him about the carts, and he'll encourage you to continue on.\n\n\n### Defeat Crimson-Silver Cart\"\n            - Following Text: \"After the boss fight in The Emerald Hall, follow the path until you reach the Crimson-Silver Cart. You'll find the Pale-Axe Stalwart here fighting the cart if you've exhausted his dialogue at the previous location.\n\nThe Crimson-Silver Cart has a wider area that it attacks in, so not only will it shoot flames out at the bottom all around it, but it will also roll around and try to mow you down.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
