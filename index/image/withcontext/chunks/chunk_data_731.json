Getting to the boss, however, requires finding a key item that you can't get until Chapter 2. This isn't the only Loong boss you can find in the game, so if you want to access the secret area, and know the whereabouts of the Loong Dragon Bosses, here's everything you need to know.\n\n* How to Get the Loong Scales\n* How to Find the Chapter 1 Secret Dragon Boss\n* How to Find the Chapter 2 Secret Boss\n* How to Find Chapter 3 Dragon Boss\n* How to Find the Chapter 4 Secret Boss\n\n## How to Get the Loong Scales\n\nBreaking the wall is a little bit trickier than it seems because it requires **an especially powerful attack** , and what happens in the pit also depends on how the fight with the King of Flowing Sands went. You'll either see a cutscene if you let him live or need to use a Pungent Flesh Chunk to get the First Prince of Flowing Sands to appear if you killed him.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If you're lucky, you can actually use the First Prince of Flowing Sands to crack the wall for you if you are able to bait him into lunging into the wall. Alternatively, you can use a spirit such as the Wandering Wight Spirit and transform into it to use the head bash and split the wall.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
