With a loud gong, the trapped \"Admiral\" will use the cymbal to awaken a giant turtle whose mountainous shell you're actually standing on.\n\nAs the turtle begins to swim through the Bitter Seal, the woman will become aware of your presence, starting this new region off with a bang of a boss fight.\n\n\nAs long as your patient to wait for the right moments to get in close and attack, and make sure you're using shock-quelling medicine, you'll be able to come out on top. Even as Kang-Jin Star tries to flee in her dragon form, the Destined One will see to it that she crashes into the large cymbals, freeing the prisoner inside!\n\nThis imprisoned Pig Guai is none other than Zhu Bajie, who traveled with Sun Wukong during his adventures in Journey to the West!\n\n\nAs you start exploring the path over to the right, an echoing voice will lead you to a large open platform where dragon humanoid figure appears to be frozen in place with its fishing rod. If you interact with it while holding the Loong Scales, it will crackle to life, and begin a new secret boss fight.\n\n\nWhen he falls, you'll earn some Fine Gold Thread and another Loong Pearl, and can loot a nearby chest that appears for the Mountain-Shaking Claw material and Breath of Fire Soak for your Gourd. This new material will unlock the upgrade path for your Loongwreathe Staff into the Golden Loong Staff, but you'll need to find and defeat the last of the four Loongs to craft it.\n\nOnce you've had your fill of exploring the \"Turtle Island\", you can head to the front where the small Pig Guai stands waiting, and interact with him for the turtle to finally make its landing at the next part of the Bitter Lake.\n\n\nStart by heading along the shore and defeating various Frozen Corpses, and look for a small building in the distance by the water's edge. As you near it, you can also spot a dragon man standing alone in the shallows. Zhu Bajie seems to know him, but as you approach, you'll be pulled into another boss fight.\n\n\nAs you head close to inspect the skull of the great snake, a Yaoguai Chief will fly down to intercept you: a much bigger version of the bats you've faced recently!\n\n\nHead back inside the tunnel and take the right path, and you'll find a bridge to cross with a green Wisp to absorb, and the next Shrine to rest at.\n\n## Precept Corridor\n\nAlong this road are several important things to take note of: There's a lone Wolf Guardian patrolling this road, but you can also find a **Meditation Spot** just off to the left in front of a statue where two Frozen Corpses can come alive to attack.\n\nJust beyond the Meditation Point, look at the base of the fallen stone slab blocking your path, and you'll find that someone has placed an altar in front of it, which a small **Treasure Chest** holding the formula for the Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets, along with a few free samples!\"\n            - Following Text: \"Take a new path off to the right from the fallen stone slab, and you'll find a large wall with two paths in either direction. Head to the right first to find a Monk Supporter standing over a green Wisp you can absorb, and then take the other path.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3.
