Once you no longer see electricity crackling along his blade, that's your cue to go back to pressing the attack by getting in staggering blows.\"\n            - Following Text: \"In particular, we recommend the Red Tides transformation spell to evade around his attacks while burning him, as he swings are slow enough that you can have an easier time performing the wolf guai's ultimate spell attack for big damage.\n\nThis fight will largely come down to learning his moves enough that you can anticipate and avoid his powerful attacks, and find your opening to keep him staggered and on the defensive.
