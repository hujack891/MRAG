They've got a back that seems to hold many surprises inside, and will share one with you - a mighty Yaoguai Queen!\n\n## Yaoguai Queen Boss Fight - Kang-Jin Loong\n\nAnother wild tail slam attack will come when the boss rapidly spins in a front circle while facing you, building up momentum from several rotations to finally slam their tail down from above.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Be wary when Kang-Jin Loong begins to roar and emit lightning all around, as they can perform an attack to summon a series of lightning strikes along the ground. They'll track your position, so keep strafing and dodging to outpace them, and don't worry about fighting while in this evasive mode.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
