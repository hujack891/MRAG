Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of The Webbed Hollow: the Village of Lanxi, as well as how to navigate the town and defeat the Second Sister.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Estate of the Zhu**\n- Yaoguai Chief - The Second Sister\n\n\nHead down the sloping street and grab a green Wisp along the way, and you'll find yourself crossing a small bridge to a clearing with a shack covered in webs. Standing our front are two Grasshopper Guai that can strike extremely quickly, but aren't as durable as the Beetle Captain.\n\nClear them out with Zhu Bajie's help, and you'll find they were guarding a large **Treasure Chest** holding several consumables, which may include a Loong Aura Amplification Pellet, as well as a Knot of Voidness and Blood of the Iron Bull.\n\n\nJust up the stairs from the Shrine is a door, so once you've made all your purchases, upgraded gear, and given the Zodiac Village another visit, you can try knocking on the door.\n\nZhu Bajie will suggest a bit of subterfuge, disguising yourselves as the Wushan Lesser Guai who were hauling the chest at the start of the chapter. You'll be met by a shrewd woman, who will immediately figure out the little pig's disguise. She happens to have a disguise of her own, and will transform into her true self.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - The Second Sister\n\nGo back and check the large building near the door you first came through, and you should be able to spot a glowing pot in the back of the room. Break it, and you'll reveal a new **Awaken Wine Worm** to add to your collection!\n\nThe Estate of the Zhu Awaken Wine Worm\n\nYou can find some Fragrant Jade Flower to harvest in the corner of the arena, as well as another large area to the right with two **Treasure Chests** stashed away in opposite corners, and then follow your ally into the next area.\"\n            - Following Text: \"There's a large pit in the middle of this courtyard, but before you follow Zhu Bajie down, check the large altar on the other side of the pit, and you'll be able to claim a **Celestial Jade Lotus Pill** to increase your maximum health!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
