Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby.\n\n\nAs you get close to the edge of the cliff, you'll find another clearing with a rock in the middle. This is the third Poison Chief in the region.\n\nWhen you've beaten the third Poison Chief, head over to the start of the red trees. As you enter the clearing with the lightning, you'll find the next Keeper's Shrine on the left.\n\n\nWhen it's defeated, head back along the river and look for the golden tree.\n\n## Mantis-Catching Swamp\n\nNow that you've cleaned up the majority of the optional bosses, it's time to find the last of the main bosses. You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis.\n\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Emerald-Armed Mantis\n\nIt will then start to use one blade at a time, and start to slash away. Occasionally, this will see the mantis spin around in a circle with the blades doing the same.\"\n            - Following Text: \"It's only when the mantis' health bar drops to around 70% that the fight changes drastically. A cutscene will play and the mantis will sharpen its blades, then dip them in the liquid, pulling them out so that they're now red.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
