Clear out the foes, and then open it to find a **Copper Pill** Soak for your Gourd. This one in particular has an impressive effect to negate the cost of Rock Solid when used soon after using the gourd.\n\n\nOpen the large gate the Rat Imperial Guard were posted at, and head through to the other side. Be sure to look to the right as you open the gate, and you’ll find a tree with glowing flowers on it. Gather the **Luojia Fragrant Vine** , and be sure to return to the Shen Monkey later to improve your Gourd when you can!\n\nWatch out for another Lingzhiling in disguise nearby from the fragrant vine, and then travel up the path (check a small cave on the left for a green Wisp) and up to the Windrest Hamlet Shrine.\n\n## Windrest Hamlet\n\nHead down the path around the homes, and you can find a wooden chest with 3 **Yaoguai Core** in an open area near a very long bridge leading back across the ravine toward Fright Cliff. However, a lone and imposing figure will block you as you try to cross the bridge.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Tiger’s Acolyte\n\nSpeaking of opportune times, you should also head back through the Rockrest Flats to the Drunk Boar, and give him the Sobering Stone you found in the village. He’ll thank you for it, but complain of hunger next, and talk about setting off in search of a meal. Keep speaking until he mentions the Temple of Crouching Tiger, so you’ll know where to find him.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Be sure to travel back to the Crouching Tiger Temple entrance next, and look for him near the top of the stairs to the right — opposite where the Meditation Spot is. He’ll be resting against the far wall, and complaining about the meat. What he really wants now is some Jade Lotus. You should already have plenty of that stored away, but if not, you can easily find some in most pools of water, especially the large pool where you first entered the chapter.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
