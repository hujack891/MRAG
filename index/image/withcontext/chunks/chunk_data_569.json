With a loud gong, the trapped \"Admiral\" will use the cymbal to awaken a giant turtle whose mountainous shell you're actually standing on.\n\nAs the turtle begins to swim through the Bitter Seal, the woman will become aware of your presence, starting this new region off with a bang of a boss fight.\n\n## Yoaguai King Boss Fight - Kang-Jin Star\n\nAnother terrifying attack she can commence when you're at close range comes when she proclaims \"Yield... to your true self!\". Floating in the air, she'll create a large electric dome around her that continues to expand, meaning you'll want to break off the attack and retreat to a safe distance.\n\nNote that the field will also generate an electric ring along the ground to reach even farther that you'll need to jump or pillar stance over - but it also only moves along a flat horizontal axis, and standing on rocks or slope can often cause it to go under you.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When appearing to float up above you, watch carefully if she summons an electrical imbued spike in her hand. She'll fly down close to throw it at the ground, and even if you dodge you'll need to watch for when it creates a tremor to explode the ground around it.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
