However, you'll only be able to access it in Chapter 5 after completing all the secret areas in the game. We'd recommend waiting until you've finished Chapter 6 of the game and beat it before you visit Mount Mei, due to it being a vital place to see for the secret ending of the game.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **How to Unlock Mount Mei**\n* **How to Enter Mount Mei from The Great Pagoda**\n* **Mount Mei**\n- Erlang, The Sacred Divinity\n- The Four Heavenly Kings\n- Erlang Shen\n\n\nThere are several steps you need to take to unlock Mount Mei. You can find a detailed breakdown on our dedicated page: How to Unlock the Secret Ending (True Ending). But here's a quick rundown of everything you'll need to do by Chapter 6 to reach it.\n\n1. Complete the Chapter 1 secret area of the Ancient Guanyin Temple\n2. Complete the Chapter 2 secret area of the Kingdom of Sahali\n3. Complete the Green-Capped Martialist/Treasure Hunter quest in Chapter 3\n4. Complete the Chapter 4 secret area of the Purple Cloud Mountain\n5. Complete the Chapter 5 secret area of Bishui Cave\n6. Return to **The Great Pagoda in Chapter 3**. You can find it on the Snow-Veiled Trail in the Pagoda Realm.\n\n\nWhen you’re in The Great Pagoda, you’ll see tapestries around the room. One tapestry, at the very top of the room, will be red. Head for this, and a cutscene will begin where the small Buddha from Chapter 3 will be waiting for you. He'll open the tapestry and let you into Mount Mei.\n\n\nWhen you're through the tapestry, head up the stairs and follow the path. About halfway up you'll need to shimmy across a ledge on the left to reach the other side, then you'll continue up to the Mei-Jian Peak Keeper's Shrine.\n\n## Mei-Jian Peak\n\nHere is where you'll need to get your gear together before you go up to the tip of the mountain, where you'll be entering a boss battle against a familiar face.\n\n### Erlang, The Sacred Divinity\"\n            - Following Text: \"As you reach the peak of the mountain, you'll see a black dog. It will run toward the building at the top of the peak and soon join Erlang, The Sacred Divinity, who you fought at the very beginning of the game. This time, however, it's a bigger challenge.\n\nErlang is undoubtedly one of the toughest bosses in the game. To make it harder, he has a health bar and a shield bar, and you'll need to deplete his shield to do maximum damage. There is a quick way to knock this down, however, and that's to use the Plantain Fan. Each time you're able to throw this out, it will get his shield gone in a few seconds. You can then make the most of his vulnerable state, by following up with heavy attacks.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
