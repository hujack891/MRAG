As you near it, you can also spot a dragon man standing alone in the shallows. Zhu Bajie seems to know him, but as you approach, you'll be pulled into another boss fight.\n\n## Boss Fight - Chen Loong\n\nOther times, he may only summon one smaller tail, but this one can expel its electrical energy in a projectile blast when the tail swings.\"\n            - Following Text: \"His strongest attack by far is when he jumps into the air with his green weapon, charging it with energy before crashing down with it.
