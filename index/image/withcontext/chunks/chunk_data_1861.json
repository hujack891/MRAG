They've got a back that seems to hold many surprises inside, and will share one with you - a mighty Yaoguai Queen!\n\n## Yaoguai Queen Boss Fight - Kang-Jin Loong\n\nKang-Jin Loong will often begin the fight by racing right at you headfirst, so be ready to dodge to the side. If you can time things right, Immobilize can pin her in place long enough to get some hits in.\n\nGet your hits in on her face when she returns to float in front of you, and be ready for the boss to whip around and prepare new attacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If she starts to rapidly fly in circles, dodge back and you'll avoid a whirlwind attack that has a fairly large range outside of her actual body.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
