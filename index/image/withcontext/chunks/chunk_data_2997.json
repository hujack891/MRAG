Clear out the foes, and then open it to find a **Copper Pill** Soak for your Gourd. This one in particular has an impressive effect to negate the cost of Rock Solid when used soon after using the gourd.\n\n## Windrest Bridge\n\nAnother Rat Imperial Guard will jump down from the rooftops to ambush you, and a Blazebone in the corner of the courtyard may try to give you trouble while you're otherwise engaged. Lure the Rat out of range so you can deal with him in peace, then go for the bone thrower.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The Boar’s Sobering StoneAfter killing the Blazebone in this courtyard, look around for an open shack across from a Fire Bellflower, and you’ll find a small glowing jar. Break it open and you’ll receive a **Sobering Stone** \\- the exact kind of item the drunk boar in the yellow robe needs to sober up back at the Fright Cliff.\n\nExit the large building to the side to find a larger open center of the village, where a Spearbone patrols near a few more Blazebones. If you stick to the left wall, you can find a walkway up to a group of ruined shacks. Here you’ll find a Rat Governor looking over a chest, but beware, he’s got several Rat Archers backing him up in the corners.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
