Though it is a short area, it will prove to be a challenging one as you go up against the greedy King of the Mountain. Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the cave to the mountaintop, as well as how to defeat the boss of this area in his two forms, the Black Wind King and the Black Bear Guai.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Cave Interior**\n- Black Wind King\n* **Outside the Cave**\n* **Bodhi Peak**\n- Black Bear Guai\n\n\nReturn to the path and take the stairs up to fight against another Wolf Assassin as the cave grows dark, and draw them into the light if needed.\n\nAs you reach an open part of the cave, you’ll have to face one more assassin along the darkened path, and you may notice they’ll go out of their way to destroy the torches along the path to further envelop them in darkness. If you have trouble facing them, always try to bring them to a brighter spot.\n\nNote that if you went ahead and defeated the Secret Boss by ringing the three bells, you should also have access to craft an additional Bronze Set that improves your abilities using the Immobilize Spell!\n\nCraft and upgrade whatever you can afford at the moment, because a boss is waiting inside the temple to test your might, and he’s no pushover.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Black Wind King\n\nAfter his next Black Wind assault, be ready to transform using the Red Tides Spell, and charge up a dash attack the moment he lands in the center of the arena, and use it and the transformation spell’s pogo attack to perform a massive hit once you catch him after a teleport.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Counter each of his teleports when his attacks complete, and you’ll soon defeat the Yaoguai King, forcing him to retreat as he yells for you to face his true form at the top of the mountain. However, in his retreat, he’ll leave behind some of his Black Wind, which the Keeper of the Mountain will harness and pass onto you, giving you a brand new spell: **Cloud Step**.\n\nThis spell will allow you to vanish while dashing forward, creating a copy of yourself that enemies will target. While in this mist-like form, you’ll be invisible for a short duration, and attacking will execute an Unveiling Strike for increased damage while catching foes off guard!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
