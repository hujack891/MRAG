Though it is a short area, it will prove to be a challenging one as you go up against the greedy King of the Mountain. Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the cave to the mountaintop, as well as how to defeat the boss of this area in his two forms, the Black Wind King and the Black Bear Guai.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Cave Interior**\n- Black Wind King\n* **Outside the Cave**\n* **Bodhi Peak**\n- Black Bear Guai\n\n\nReturn to the path and take the stairs up to fight against another Wolf Assassin as the cave grows dark, and draw them into the light if needed.\n\nAs you reach an open part of the cave, you’ll have to face one more assassin along the darkened path, and you may notice they’ll go out of their way to destroy the torches along the path to further envelop them in darkness. If you have trouble facing them, always try to bring them to a brighter spot.\n\nNote that if you went ahead and defeated the Secret Boss by ringing the three bells, you should also have access to craft an additional Bronze Set that improves your abilities using the Immobilize Spell!\n\nCraft and upgrade whatever you can afford at the moment, because a boss is waiting inside the temple to test your might, and he’s no pushover.\n\n\nCheck the sides of the cave to find some Jade Lotus and Aged Ginseng, then head to the far end to sidle through an exit. This disguised loading screen will turn the day into dusk as you find yourself closer to the top of the mountain.\n\n## Outside the Cave\n\nHead back to the rooftop area where a Bullguard like the first mini-boss you fought stands alongside a few more Wolf Archers behind him and on a ledge to the side. Use your Cloud Step to take out the one all the way back, then look for some green slanted rocks to try jump up and then left to reach the ledge with the last archer.\"\n            - Following Text: \"With the ranged support out of the way, you can safely engage the Bullguard. Since this one isn’t a mini-boss, he’ll go down a lot faster when you Immobilize and punish him during his lengthy swing attacks.\n\nHead along the far wooden platforms past where the Bullguard was stationed to find one last Wolf Sentinel and Archer, and Cloud Step past the melee attacker to slam into the archer first before finishing off his friend.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
