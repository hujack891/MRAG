Responsible for the \"beguiling chant\" that curses you in the Pagoda Realm, you can find this boss inside the Mani Wheel at the top of the prison.\n\n* **Rewards:** Spirit of Captain Wise-Voice, Mind Core\n\n## Where to Find Captain Wise-Voice\n\nCaptain Wise-Voice is one of the four captains you can find in Chapter 3, and is a required boss to escape the prison of the Pagoda Realm. You can reach him by escaping up through the four levels of the Pagoda Prison and past the Outside the Wheel Shrine.\n\n### Captain Wise-Voice Boss Fight and Guide\n\nTo defeat him, stay patient by building up focus points with sustained damage on his leg, using your Spirit Attacks too to rack up damage so that it can stagger the boss, then unleash more combos before your biggest charged up strike to maximize damage to his weak point before he rises. Use Cloud Step to get away from some of his more pesky lighting strikes and beams, and use Immobilize to stop Lotus-Vision's wild melee stomps and attacks (it generally doesn't work to help extend his stunned state).\"\n            - Following Text: \"When Captain Wise-Voice finally falls to your assault, the Pagoda Realm will at last be free of his beguiling chant. This means you can head down to re-explore if you missed any areas without worrying about the debuff (but it also means any Sentry Lanterns not killed are gone forever).\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
