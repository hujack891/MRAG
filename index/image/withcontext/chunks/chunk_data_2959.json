Located at the end of the New Thunderclap Temple, you'll have to defeat him twice in a drawn out battle to claim the Sage's Relic he guards.\n\n* Rewards: Cosmo Radiance, Cold Iron Leaves x3, Fine Gold Thread x2, Gold Tree Core, Refined Iron Sand x2, Mind Core, 4330 Experience, 2267 Will\n\n\nAfter resting at the Mahavira Hall Shrine at the top of the stairs, be sure to take assessment of your gear. Cultivate your best Spirits, make sure you have a lot of pills on hand an craft a bunch of extra Shock-Quelling Powder (you're going to need it).\n\nYou should also have any anti-shock gear/curios/soaks on hand as well, along with whatever else can keep you alive for awhile. This final encounter is spread out into three distinct fights, and while you'll be able to respawn and pick up where you left off for the first two sections from the Shrine, the final section won't take you back to the Shrine.\n\n* First Encounter\n* Second Encounter\n\n\nYou'll need to defeat the Macaque Chief inside his magic sack to escape, whereupon you'll be transported to his floating shelf, and you'll be able to fight him one last time.\n\n## Yellowbrow Boss Fight (Second Encounter)\n\nWhen you finally reach the last third of Yellowbrow's health, he'll again toss you into the air, and this time the Apramana Bat will catch you and fling you around. You'll actually gain the Apramana Bat Spirit during this sequence, and fly right at him only to be knocked to the ground - again taking off a chunk of your health in an unavoidable scene.\n\nIn this final phase, Yellowbrow is more likely than ever to summon his giant lighting blast again as he creates motes of lightning all around him, meaning you'll need to race to the far corner or use something like the Wind Tamer to snap him out of it.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He can also more frequently employ lots of very deadly moves, like repeatedly swinging his electrified mace around him in multiple arcs with large electric waves of force that have an additional delayed detonation.\n\nYou'll need to play things very smart and cautious now, and don't be afraid to pause and use additional consumables, including rare ones given by the Xu Dog in the Zodiac Village. This match is a true endurance test, and you'll want to use everything in your arsenal to keep Yellowbrow on the defensive.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
