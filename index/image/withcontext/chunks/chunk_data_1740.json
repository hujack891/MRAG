    "summary_promot": "You are given an image and related metadata and context.\n\n            Metadata:\n            - Document Title: Chapter 3 Secrets\n            - Section Title: Skandha of Thought\n\n            Context:\n            - Preceding Text: \"# Chapter 3 Secrets\n\nThe secrets in Chapter 3 will have you continuing to fight hidden bosses, collecting the spirits of important captains, and taking you to an NPC hub.\n\n\nWhen you stumble upon The Great Pagoda in Chapter 3, you can enter it. However, it will appear as little more than an empty room, potentially with tapestries hanging already (depending on the secret areas you've found and cleared so far). The Great Pagoda is actually linked to a secret area that you can access after Chapter 5, so jump down to the information on Mount Mei, which you can find at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n* How to Open the Purple Seal Prison Doors in the Pagoda Realm\n\n\nThe prisoner in the cell in the Pagoda Realm can be accompanied by the body of a two-headed rat depending on your actions from Chapter 2. You'll need to have spoken to the Rat Guai trapped in a little building in Sandgate Village. If you do this, you'll find the body of the two-headed rat in the cell and be able to take the Ashen Slumber Transformation Spell from them when you finally unlock the seals.\n\n\nCaptain Lotus-Vision forms part of a larger questline in Black Myth: Wukong, that also involves the NPC in the sealed cell. There are actually four captains you can fight in this chapter; two of them are unmissable, but Captain Lotus-Vision and Captain Void-Illusion need to be found. When you have the souls of all four of them, you can return to the NPC in the cell and receive a unique weapon.\n\n\n* How to Find Cyan Loong\n\n\n* How to Unlock the Zodiac Village and Upgrade Armor\n\n\nNot only does unlocking Zodiac Village introduce the Yin Tiger and the ability to upgrade armor, you can also challenge him to a duel. Doing so will reward you with a new armor set to craft, a new curio slot, and the Ebon Flow Transformation Spell.\n\n\nContinue straight on from the North Short of the Bitter Lake Keeper's Shrine and keep going to the end until you see a skeleton. The Apramana Bat will appear, and defeating it will allow you to interact with the snake skeleton. A cutscene will play, where the large turtle will shed a tear, and you can go and collect it from the shoreline near the turtle's head to collect the Turtle Tear Soak.\n\n## Skandha of Thought\"\n            - Following Text: \"You can collect the Skandha of Thought in Chapter 3 when you reach the Mindfulness Cliff Keeper's Shrine in the Valley of Ecstasy. To the right of the shrine, there's a large canyon, and there's actually a path below that you can drop down onto. If you follow this path, you'll find the monkey again and be able to collect the Skandha of Thought from the head.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
