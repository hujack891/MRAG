Located in the lowest section of The Webbed Hollow, he is one of the many frog minibosses you can encounter in the game, though he sports a hidden surprise.\n\n* Rewards: Buddha's Left Hand (Key Item), Tadpole, Refined Iron Sand, 1562 Experience, 1449 Will\n\n\nBaw-Li-Guhh-Baw is an optional encounter that you'll find exploring the massive Webbed Hollow Portion of Chapter 4. After descending down past the Buddha's Right Hand and spying on the Spider Sisters, you can head down a long path with an optional passage through a fissure on the right.\n\nThis path will lead you to a ledge with an archer, and then right along the path above the main trail where the Lower Hollow Shrine is to where the frog boss waits in a flooded cavern. You can also climb up to the ledge from the Shrine by jumping and performing aerial heavy attacks.\n\n## Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw Boss Fight and Guide\n\nHe can also wave the tongue-hand around in a haphazard fashion, making it weave in a large arc from side to side as it swipes at you three times, before rising high up to slam down at you (but you can use Rock Solid to send him tumbling back in surprise).\"\n            - Following Text: \"The most devious attack of all doesn't even start with his tongue.
