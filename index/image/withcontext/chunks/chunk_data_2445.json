Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of The Webbed Hollow: the Village of Lanxi, as well as how to navigate the town and defeat the Second Sister.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Estate of the Zhu**\n- Yaoguai Chief - The Second Sister\n\n## The Webbed Hollow\n\nDown will drop a Puppet Spider, a Yaoguai that likes to ambush and stab at you with its many legs. Luckily, you'll have Zhu Bajie on your side once more, and overwhelming lone opponents will be an easy task. They can spew poison from a distance, so watch yourself that you don't have to waste any Antimiasma potions this early.\"\n            - Following Text: \"As you approach the entrance to the village, you can spot two paths - a main one directly ahead, and a side path leading to the left down some stairs. You can also check out a small stream to the right with more plants to harvest in and around the water, and a green Wisp to absorb (it's guarded by another Puppet Spider).\n\nIn fact, this town is teeming with green Wisps of all sizes, which means you'll have a lot of these little spirits to absorb to gain both will and some of your Gourd charges back in a pinch.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
