Below, you'll find a Walkthrough for the first major area of The Flaming Mountains called Woods of Ember, as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* ** **Ashen Pass I\n- Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Brown-Iron Cart\n* **Camp of Seasons**\n* **Height of Ember**\n- Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones\n- Yoaguai Chief - Gray-Bronze Cart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind\n* **Ashen Pass II**\n\n\nInstead of finding him wherever you left him kneeling, you'll now see him by the edge of the cliff. As you come back down the stairs to the area where you fought him, you'll see a small set opposite with two Buddha statues on either side. Go up these and to the left, to find him overlooking the mountain. Talk to him and exhaust any new dialogue.\n\n\nAt the top, a Lavabat will attack you as soon as you reach the area. On the right, you'll find another Bull Sergeant and two more Revenant Charbones. Clear this and then activate the **Height of Ember Keeper's Shrine** near the tree on the right.\n\n\nBe ready to follow him and hit him as soon as this happens. Even when he pulls his tusks out from the ground, he'll be temporarily stunned, giving you enough time to attack. He will continue to chase you, blowing wind on you, but will also start to spit gusts of wind out. These will turn into small tornados but they're extremely short-lived, so as long as you can dodge the initial gust, you should be able to quickly get out of the way of the tornado.\n\n## Ashen Pass II\n\nAfter defeating them, the fox gaui will transform into Pingping the Bull King's daughter, and thank you for saving her. Once the cutscene is over, you'll receive your rewards for defeating Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind and the next Keeper's Shrine will be available to you, if you follow the path to the left and up the stairs.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once you've activated the shrine, look opposite it to find a small area where a chest sits. Open this to collect a **Celestial Jade Lotus Pill**.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.
