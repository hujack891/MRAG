Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nThe easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step. Cast it near the start of the rope bridge, and then sprint all the way to the other end, and don't try to staff spin if any arrows come your way, or you're likely to walk off the side by accident.\n\n\nRather helpfully, there's a brazier by a ledge nearby, and looking down you can find a spot to drop back down to the two bridges we noted at the start of the Lower Hollow, putting you quickly back on track to the main pathway.\n\n\nBe sure to climb back up the ledges (use a jumping heavy attack to gain height), and continue to follow this path to a flooded cave where this chapter's Frog Boss awaits.\n\n\nPast this foe, you'll enter another long dark tunnel, and you can find a Puppet Spider hanging up on the right above a green Wisp to absorb, and a patrolling Lantern Holder further down the tunnel.\n\n\nOnce you're ready, head through the gate to join the party, and it seems your just in time to meet the not-so-lucky groom.\n\n\nThere actually isn't anything more you can do in the Hut of Immortality, as all the doors are sealed. However, when you return to the Shrine outside, you'll find a new cave path has been carved out that leads outside to a large muddy hole.\n\nYour battle with Zhu Bajie isn't over. In fact -- it's about to get a whole lot harder.\n\n\nOnce you manage to burn down the rest of his health, you'll finally be able to free Zhu Bajie from the bewitching effect of the needle that was stabbed into his head, thanks to the mirror you found on the Right Hand of Buddha.\n\nUnfortunately, the spiders aren't done with him, and he'll be whisked away, leaving you with his **Blood-Stained Needle** and the **Jade Moon Rabbit Curio**.\n\n## The Purifying Spring\n\nWith the boss battle over, you can find a cave entrance on the far side of the muddy arena, leading to The Purifying Spring Shrine, with a **Treasure Chest** full of materials off to the right. You'll also gain access to a new Non-Pure Armor Set to craft by having defeated Zhu Bajie, which boasts some great defense and poison resistance.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Exit the cave and grab a green Wisp as you do, and you'll find yourself at the bottom of a large gorge with a spring in the middle, and a winding path up the cliff walls to the top. There's another green Wisp overlooking the pool of water, and scattered Skeletal Snakes all about.\n\nHead to the far side of the spring where you can find a Lantern Holder patrolling by some cocoons, and a path beyond him leads up to a high ledge guarded by a Dragonfly Guai.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
