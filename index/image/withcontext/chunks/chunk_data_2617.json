Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nThe easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step. Cast it near the start of the rope bridge, and then sprint all the way to the other end, and don't try to staff spin if any arrows come your way, or you're likely to walk off the side by accident.\n\n\nRather helpfully, there's a brazier by a ledge nearby, and looking down you can find a spot to drop back down to the two bridges we noted at the start of the Lower Hollow, putting you quickly back on track to the main pathway.\n\n\nBe sure to climb back up the ledges (use a jumping heavy attack to gain height), and continue to follow this path to a flooded cave where this chapter's Frog Boss awaits.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n\nIt may take a bit to learn and anticipate all of his surprises, and you can try using the Thrust Stance to get some distance away from his close-range moves. Make the most of your deflections or Immobilize to press your attack and augment it with Spirits and Transformations to keep the boss staggered so that you can finish him off.\n\nWhen Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw is defeated, you'll gain another Tadpole to upgrade your frog Spirit, as well as the Left Hand of Buddha! This means you can now use both hands to craft and purchase a special Immortal Blessing Gourd when you visit the Shen Monkey in the Zodiac Village!\"\n            - Following Text: \"You can look for an exit to the boss arena on the far side, which leads to a ledge with a green Wisp, and a drop back down to the main path from the Shrine.\n\nBehind, you'll find the area littered with more Stone Spiders leading back to the Shrine, while ahead a lone Beetle Captain guards a small archway.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
