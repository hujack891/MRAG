It is dropped by a Yaoguai Chief Miniboss called the Tiger’s Acolyte. This boss battle can be found at the far end of the Yellow Wind Formation region, at the very end of the **Windrest Hamlet** along a large stone bridge leading back to the Fright Cliff region.\n\nAfter defeating the Tiger’s Acolyte, you’ll gain the Old-Rattle Drum, which appears to have belonged to the Acolyte’s son, but no other details are provided. You will need to find three areas where you can use the drum to summon a spirit, in **locations all across the Yellow Wind Ridge**. The only clue you’ll have is that entering the correct area will **cause your vision to warp** , and the ghostly voice of a boy calling out to you.\n\n\nThe first location you can use the Old-Rattle Drum is close to where you fought the Tiger’s Acolyte, further back in the **Windrest Hamlet**. Return across the bridge to the **Windrest Hamlet Shrine** and pass back through the large gate, immediately taking a left to the **large house surrounded by sitting Withering Corpses**.\n\nA visual cue will appear along with the **voice of a child** beckoning you, and you’ll be able to use the Rattle-Drum in front of the house. Be warned, as doing so will provoke all the nearby corpses to attack you, but you’ll also get some interesting dialogue from the child.\n\n## Second Location - Windseal Gate\n\nThe second location where you can use the Old-Rattle Drum is on the path down from the sealed stone door where you fought the King of Flowing Sands and his Second Rat Prince son, using the **Keenness of Tiger** and **Sterness of Stone** items from the Vanguard bosses (The Stone Vanguard and Tiger Vanguard) to open the door.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Head down from the door towards a bridge, but take a right to pass through a ruined building overhang where several **Weasel Captains** are lurking.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
