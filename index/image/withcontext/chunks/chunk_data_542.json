Located along the main path through the Bamboo Grove, this boss is a ranged fighter who moves quickly to evade you while filling you with poison strikes.\n\n* **Rewards:** Guangmou Spirit, Materials, 700 Experience, 520 Will\n\n## Where to Find Guangmou\n\nFollow the main path across the bridge from the Shrine and down to a stream, and follow it into a large bamboo forest patrolled by snakes. On the opposite side of the circular forest, you can spot two small statues forming an entrance into the grove where Guagnmou lurks.\n\n### Guangmou Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe good news is other than his poison spray, Guangmou doesn’t really have any melee attacks to defend himself at close range — other than a very slow repulsing explosion he needs to charge up by spinning while he gathers energy. Use this to your advantage by pressing your light attack combos whenever you close the gap, and if you have defeated the Wandering Wight, use its Spirit Attack to knock him down with a mighty headbutt to keep him from teleporting away.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Another good strategy to note is that if you’re in danger of getting close to becoming poisoned, using the Red Tides spell can help you transform out of danger. Any status effects suffered while transformed as Guangzhi will be removed when you regain your regular health bar. As an added bonus, Guangmou will even comment on your transformation.\n\nOnce you’ve learned how to evade his projectiles, the rest of the fight will just boil down to chasing him down and stunning him however you can with Immobilize, your Spirit Attack, and other heavy hits. When he falls, you’ll gain Guangmou’s Spirit to add to your collection, allowing you to summon venomous snakes of your own!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
