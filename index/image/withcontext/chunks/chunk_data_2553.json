After conquering a variety of bosses and obtaining Wukong's special armor, The Destined One is ready to complete his journey. Below, you'll find a Walkthrough of the final areas of Mount Huaguo as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Water Curtain Cave**\n* **Return Path**\n* **Peak of Innocence**\n* **Birthstone - Heart of Birthstone**\n- Stone Monkey\n- The Great Sage's Broken Shell\n\n\nAfter another story from Zhu Bajie, the giant staff will shrink and you'll be able to get it from the body of water in front of you. Now that you've acquired the Jingubang and look exactly like Wukong, head to the back of the cave directly ahead.\n\nFollow the path to the peak, where you'll come to the Return Path Keeper's Shrine.\n\n\nWhen you emerge on the other side, you'll see the final stretch of the path that dips down and then slopes upward. Head for the top and activate the Peak of Innocence Keeper's Shrine, just before the end of the path.\n\n\nOn the other side, you'll find the Old Monkey. He'll tell you to step onto a boat, and then transport you across the water, while he recites the memories of Wukong.\n\n## Birthstone - Heart of Birthstone\n\nAs the cutscene sees you move toward the Stone Monkey, you'll be automatically thrown into a fight against it.\n\nNote! You won't be able to activate the Heart of Birthstone Keeper's Shrine here unless you die, but if you do, you won't need to go back to a previous shrine – you'll automatically be transported back here.\n\n\nThis fight has two phases, so be prepared for a tough battle and think about how you manage your Gourd and Spell usage throughout. You'll want to take in medicines that include Body-Warming and Body-Cooling Powder, as well as those that strengthen your attacks such as Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets and Loong Aura Amplification Pellets. You might prefer other medicines depending on the build you're playing with, such as the Mirage or Life-Saving Pill.\n\nThe first thing to note is that the Stone Monkey, like other Stone enemies, is resistant to elemental attacks, so the best thing you can do here is have a build that focuses on high attack strength and increasing the chances of critical attacks. His resistance to these attacks should also influence the Transformation you take into the fight with you – we'd recommend Ebon Flow or Azure Dust, which can both deliver heavy blows.\n\n\nHe'll freeze at this moment, and it can seem like a time to strike, but he's actually preparing to grab you. If he's able to, a small cutscene plays where you're thrown and slammed on the ground either side of him. The second attack is when he goes berserk and starts slamming his fists down on the ground around him more violently and quicker than his usual attack.\n\nYour aim during this portion of the fight should be to dodge attacks while building focus, and max out the four Focus Points as soon as possible. With Wukong's armor and staff, these won't deplete, so you can land impressive heavy attacks with the staff.\n\n\nAs it staggers back and breaks down into stone, electricity will form around it and the Great Sage's Broken Shell will appear. Despite going straight into this fight from the Stone Monkey, all your Spells, Gourd uses, and health will be replenished.\n\n\nWe'd recommend having Ring of Fire equipped, so you can match him, and upgrade it as much as possible. Strangely enough, if you step into his Ring of Fire, you can also use it to build your Focus.\n\nHowever, you may prefer to use Spell Binder (if you've unlocked it) and increase your Attack and Critical Hit Chance. We'd also suggest using Plantain Fan again in this phase. You should also use Medicines like the Loong Aura Amplification Pellets, Ginseng Pellets, and Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets to buff your Focus gain and attack.\n\n\nAs mentioned, the Great Sage will use multiple stances, and you'll occasionally see him climb his staff to perform Pillar Stance. This is not to evade your attacks but is just a way to slam down on you from above. As you see the staff start to bend toward you, get ready to dash away.\n\nFinally, be mindful of where you stand in this fight. If you're too far from him, he'll throw out his staff as a spinning projectile, or swap to Thrust Stance to attack you. It's best to stick close to him but jump back when he performs perfect dodges or throws out Pluck of Many.\n\nJust like the Stone Monkey, once you've got his health bar down all the way, phase two will begin.\n\n### The Great Sage's Broken Shell Phase Two\n\nLastly, you'll see him use the Somersault Cloud spell to zoom around the area, hit you, and dash off. He will try to grab you when using this, so it's important to learn the timings and roll away as often as possible.\n\nJust like the first phase, the key to this fight is attacking when you have your Focus Points built up and not trying to finish light combos. He'll typically interrupt them or use his perfect dodge to hurt you in the process, so it's best to wait until you can land those heavy attacks. It's also important to note him during his Rock Solid phase! Otherwise, you'll see the Destined One kicked around by the Great Sage's duplicates.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Using Gingseng Pellets and Ring of Fire will get your Focus up in no time, and Smash Stance is generally favorable here, to land those heavy slamming attacks. Don't forget to throw out the Plantain Fan as soon as it's ready each time, as well, as this is one of the best ways to attack him undisturbed.\n\nOnce the fight is over, The Great Sage's Broken Shell will be vanquished, and a cutscene will begin. The Great Sage will stumble in the water and the relics will leave his body as golden orbs.\n\nEach one will land inside the Destined One as the Great Sage crumbles, and his crown lands in the water. As the Old Monkey appears again, he'll place the crown upon the Destined One's head and finish the tale of Sun Wukong.\n\nCongratulations on completing Black Myth: Wukong! Now that you've finished the game, we'd recommend experiencing the secret ending by accessing Mount Mei in The Great Pagoda (Chapter 3). To see both endings, make sure you choose \"Continue Journey\" rather than \"Enter a New Cycle\" and then return to The Great Pagoda to access a secret area.\n\nFor more guidance on unlocking the secret ending and what it means for The Destined One, see our pages How to Unlock the Secret Ending (True Ending) and Endings Explained.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
