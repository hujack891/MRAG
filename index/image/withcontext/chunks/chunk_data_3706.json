Focused on dodging and deflecting attacks to then follow those actions up with powerful attacks, Ebon Flow can easily be missed within The New West as it is a part of a long quest chain.\n\nThe spell allows you to transform into the Yin Tiger to ward off incoming blows by holding the sword horizontally, or dashing forward like a gale to close in on foes. Focus is then built up before transformation can be converted for use afterward. Ebon Flow's moveset is as follows:\n\n* **Light attack: Onslaught Blade - Raise the Great Iron Blade to strike the target, building up focus with each hit.** As Focus increases, enemies are more easily staggered with this series of attacks that raises your Great Iron Blade.\n* **Heavy attack: Rift Cleaver - Hold Heavy Attack to unleash a powerful cleave, deling massive damage.** The more Focus built up, the more devastating the damage becomes with this attack, which is a slow, powerful slam.\n* **Deflection: Blacksmith - Raise the blade to deflect assaults, build up Focus with each deflection, or dodge to switch to other moves.** This is one of the only defensive moves a Transformation Spell has, building Focus with each hit and allowing you to mitigate damage.\n\n## **Black Myth: Wukong Ebon Flow Location**\n\nOnce you have killed Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, talk to Xu Dog once again, and he will move to the Cellar location in Crouching Tiger Temple. This can only be accessed by interacting with the Tally in the Tiger Vanguard arena fight, and heading into the temple through the staircase that opens.\n\nYou will need to defeat the Tiger Vanguard and Stone Vanguard to obtain the Keeness of Tiger and Sterness of Stone in order to use the Tally. Both of these bosses are mandatory bosses within Yellow Wind Ridge.\"\n            - Following Text: \"With this area accessed, now you need to play through the majority of Chapter 3 - The New West, until you step off Turtle Island within Bitter Lake.
