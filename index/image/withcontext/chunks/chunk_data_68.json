As an optional foe, you can seek out this boss just past the Sandgate Village in a large valley cave, and will need to defeat him to unlock more than one secret boss.\n\n* Rewards: Arhat Hold Piece, Silk x2, Yarn x2, 1102 Experience, 1020 Will\n\n## Where to Find First Prince of Flowing Sands\n\nIf you did kill the King (and made his Second Son very angry), you'll have gained a Pungent Flesh Chunk Key Item from defeating the duo. This item can be used at the very edge of the valley's cliff to summon the First Prince himself.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - First Prince of Flowing Sands\n\nIf you didn’t kill the King of Flowing Sands when fighting him and his second son, he’ll have snuck over here to summon his even bigger first son to beat you into a pulp (the First Prince however, will promptly deal with the King himself). If you killed both King and Prince, you can instead toss down the Pungent Flesh Chunk to rouse the Prince out of his lair.\"\n            - Following Text: \"As a much bigger foe than the Second Prince, expect a lot of large slamming attacks in your direction. He’s a wild and unpredictable opponent, so be sure to use Cloud Step to get out of the way if you’re not sure what’s coming, then crash back into him from the sides.\n\nThe First Prince will usually start with a lunging two-hand slam attack after he stands on his hind legs that shakes up a lot of dust, but you can dodge to the side and keep attacking as he recovers.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
