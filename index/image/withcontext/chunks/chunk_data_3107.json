As a tutorial boss, the Bullguard is designed to test your abilities in dealing with a strong foe, but you'll be helped along the way learning an important spell from the Keeper of Black Mountain.\n\n* **Rewards:** Immobilize Spell, Yarn x2, 482 Experience, 390 Will\n\n## Where to Find the Bullguard\n\nSince the Bullguard is a required miniboss, he can't be missed on your journey through the opening areas of Chapter 1. You'll find him in the Forest of Wolves, not far from the Front Hills Shrine just along the main path across a bridge, keeping to the right. The Bullguard blocks a large gate area leading to the next main region of Black Wind Mountain.\n\n### Bullguard Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nHe can also perform multiple overhead swings at once ending with a massive jump attack, so it’s safe to assume that unless he’s charging at you, his swings will almost always come out in multiple hits, and you’ll want to be ready to dodge them all first before you move in and attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once you carve out about half of the Bullguard’s health bar, he’ll parry your next strike and move in for the killing blow — until the Keeper intervenes. Using an immobilization spell to lock him in place, the Keeper will pass on the magic spell to the Destined One, giving you your first spell - **Immobilize**!\n\nImmobilize allows you to bind an enemy in place for a small duration, at which point you’re able to make use of the pause to unload with attacks until the effect breaks. Stronger enemies like this Yaoguai Chief will break out a lot sooner than regular foes, and certain bosses can even resist it entirely, so be wary!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.

Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
