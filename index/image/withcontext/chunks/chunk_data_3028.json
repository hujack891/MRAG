Clear out the foes, and then open it to find a **Copper Pill** Soak for your Gourd. This one in particular has an impressive effect to negate the cost of Rock Solid when used soon after using the gourd.\n\n\nOpen the large gate the Rat Imperial Guard were posted at, and head through to the other side. Be sure to look to the right as you open the gate, and you’ll find a tree with glowing flowers on it. Gather the **Luojia Fragrant Vine** , and be sure to return to the Shen Monkey later to improve your Gourd when you can!\n\nWatch out for another Lingzhiling in disguise nearby from the fragrant vine, and then travel up the path (check a small cave on the left for a green Wisp) and up to the Windrest Hamlet Shrine.\n\n## Windrest Hamlet\n\nHead down the path around the homes, and you can find a wooden chest with 3 **Yaoguai Core** in an open area near a very long bridge leading back across the ravine toward Fright Cliff. However, a lone and imposing figure will block you as you try to cross the bridge.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Tiger’s Acolyte\n\nGive it to him, and he’ll give you a cryptic message about the Realm of Gold located where the sun sets, but it’s not a lot to go on. He also mentions the Yellow Wind Guai said “our senior brother gave me a piece of gold. I’ll need it here when the time’s right.” The Boar thinks the time is right to try it now.\n\nIt’s a bit of a riddle, but the “senior brother” was the First Prince of Flowing Sand that you fought in the Valley of Despair, who just happened to drop the Arhat Gold Piece. All that’s left is to bring it to the right place, which happens to be back where you first encountered the Boar Guai.\"\n            - Following Text: \"However, when you approach the field, you’ll find him off to the right on the stairs leading to the large door. He’ll become angry that you have the gold, and try to fight you for it.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
