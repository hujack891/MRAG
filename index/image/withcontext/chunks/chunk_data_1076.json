There are six Meditation Spots to find in Chapter 2.\n\n\nHead through the lake at the starting area and around to the left.

Head out of the archway on the left after defeating the boss and activate the Rock Clash Platform Keeper Shrine. Follow the path directly in front of the Shrine to reach the Meditation Spot.\n\n\nThe Crouching Tiger Temple Meditation Spot is on the left side of the temple. Run up the stairs and turn left just before entering the temple proper to find the statue that the Meditation Spot sits in front of.\n\n\nRockrest Flat is a somewhat hidden area behind a breakable gate near the Rockrest Flat Keeper's Shrine. Head around to the right from the Shrine and fight your way to a small wooden gate. Break the gate to gain access to the flat.\n\nThere, you will find the Meditation Spot, along with the character you need to interact with to access the secret area in Chapter 2.\n\n### The Grotto, Yellow Wind Meditation Spot\"\n            - Following Text: \"Follow the sand tornado to reach the Yellow Wind boss arena near the Windseal Gate Keeper's Shrine.
