However, you'll only be able to access it in Chapter 5 after completing all the secret areas in the game. We'd recommend waiting until you've finished Chapter 6 of the game and beat it before you visit Mount Mei, due to it being a vital place to see for the secret ending of the game.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **How to Unlock Mount Mei**\n* **How to Enter Mount Mei from The Great Pagoda**\n* **Mount Mei**\n- Erlang, The Sacred Divinity\n- The Four Heavenly Kings\n- Erlang Shen\n\n\nThere are several steps you need to take to unlock Mount Mei. You can find a detailed breakdown on our dedicated page: How to Unlock the Secret Ending (True Ending). But here's a quick rundown of everything you'll need to do by Chapter 6 to reach it.\n\n1. Complete the Chapter 1 secret area of the Ancient Guanyin Temple\n2. Complete the Chapter 2 secret area of the Kingdom of Sahali\n3. Complete the Green-Capped Martialist/Treasure Hunter quest in Chapter 3\n4. Complete the Chapter 4 secret area of the Purple Cloud Mountain\n5. Complete the Chapter 5 secret area of Bishui Cave\n6. Return to **The Great Pagoda in Chapter 3**. You can find it on the Snow-Veiled Trail in the Pagoda Realm.\n\n\nWhen you’re in The Great Pagoda, you’ll see tapestries around the room. One tapestry, at the very top of the room, will be red. Head for this, and a cutscene will begin where the small Buddha from Chapter 3 will be waiting for you. He'll open the tapestry and let you into Mount Mei.\n\n\nWhen you're through the tapestry, head up the stairs and follow the path. About halfway up you'll need to shimmy across a ledge on the left to reach the other side, then you'll continue up to the Mei-Jian Peak Keeper's Shrine.\n\n## Mei-Jian Peak\n\nHere is where you'll need to get your gear together before you go up to the tip of the mountain, where you'll be entering a boss battle against a familiar face.\n\n### Erlang, The Sacred Divinity\n\nYou can opt for a build where you try to use spells against Erlang, but he's pretty good at countering them all. For example, if you use a Transformation, he will transform as well, and sometimes will just remove your Transformation entirely. If you are going for spells, Immobilize is good but only when you've knocked his shield down. Be mindful that he can use it against you as well. Cloudstep also is useful to evade the more dangerous attacks and sneak up on him. If you do go with Spells, you'll want to get your Plantain Fan back as quickly as possible to keep knocking down his shield.\n\nHowever, we'd actually recommend using Spellbinder (fully upgraded), which you'll have picked up from the Treasure Hunter/Green-Capped Martialist side quest in Chapter 3. Equip medicines like the Loong Aura Amplication Pellets and Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets to make the most out of your Attacks and Critical Hit chances. It's also worth using Ginseng Pellets to help you with Focus recovery, and if you're finding it very hard, you might want to take the Soul Remigration Pill, which will resurrect you if you die.\"\n            - Following Text: \"There are four stages to this fight. You can knock his health down by 25% quickly, by using the Plantain Fan as soon as you enter the fight. Either use Immobilize immediately here if you're going for Spells or throw out Spellbinder.\n\nYou'll want to run about halfway across the field before you throw out the Plantain Fan, but if he goes to perform his attack, it's best to dodge this and then use the fan. Once you've knocked the first shield down, use Spellbinder and go in for the attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
