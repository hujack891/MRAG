The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems.\n\n\nAs you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple. A long slope here will send you down to a large arena, and its here you'll have your second and final encounter with an old foe - the Venom Daoist.\n\n\nBefore you do, you should also head through the nearby gateway to find a large field with a giant tree in the middle. Off on the right, you can find a wooden ledge overlooking the mountains with a **Treasure Chest** full of random materials and a Soul Remigration Pill.\n\n\nHead back to the altar, and pluck what should be the fourth and final talisman. Before you can celebrate this act, a large winged monster with a hand for a face will appear to aggressively punish you for this deed!\n\n\nNow that you've done all there is to do here, you can return to rest at the Shrine, and head toward the large field to finally catch up to the Violet Spider and her master, the Hundred-Eyed Daoist.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master\n\nThe attack won't stop there, as once he re-burrows, you'll need to keep your eyes and ears peeled. After a brief moment, his electrified sword will come hurtling in from a corner of the arena with a small lightning strike noise, and you'll need to dodge it as it embeds itself in the ground. Stay clear of the impact site, as the boss will then burrow out to grab it and perform a quick double slash with the electrified blade before spinning about (at which you should then hop in and attack).\"\n            - Following Text: \"As the fight rages on, expect him to employ a wider variety of both sword and electric attacks with his talismans, employing new combos to slice or slam, and then shoot out electric blasts or imbue his sword for bigger hits. One move to be wary of seems easy enough at first, as he'll charge up his sword by holding it close to his left side, and then unleash an upward lighting slash to his right. However, he'll immediately grab at you with his free hand, and squeeze the life out of you if you are too close to him following that first slash.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
