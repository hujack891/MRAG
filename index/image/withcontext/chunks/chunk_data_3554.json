After a shout, he’ll unleash a single slashing attack that hits hard enough to launch its own projectile slash. Caught unaware, and it’ll easily take off more than half your health bar! It’s also the easiest one to punish, as he’ll usually take the time to put the blade back before starting his next attack, giving you a lot of time to strike back.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The other attack can come extremely quickly and unfortunately has a few variants. The most common one starts as the Tiger Vanguard approaches with a spin ending in a downward kick. As soon as he finishes his kick, he’ll seamlessly unsheathe his sword as he performs a downward swing to catch you off guard. This will be followed by a quick upward slash in the same direction, and then a large arcing spinning slash finale.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
