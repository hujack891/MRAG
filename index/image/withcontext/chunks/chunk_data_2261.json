Run straight through the Hall from the nearby Keeper's Shrine and around the corner to the left. You will find the giant iron ball lodged in a cliff. You can collect the Spirit from there.\n\n\nThe Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top fight can be challenging, especially since there are two foes to deal with instead of just one. Thankfully, one usually hangs back, giving you an opportunity to focus on one half of the iron ball at a time rather than having to tackle both for the entirety of the battle.\n\nThese foes can use both halves of the iron ball to roll around the arena at high speeds, sending you flying if you get hit. Nailing the Perfect Dodge timing is a great help in this fight. The trick is to dodge just before the ball hits you, which oftentimes can be later than you think it will be. Practice makes perfect with Perfect Dodging, though, and the more you try, the better you will get.\n\nThe foes will also use each half of the iron ball as a shield of sorts. You will not do any damage to them by hitting this shield, so try to get behind them whenever they are shielding themselves. They are both armed with weapons as well as the dangerous ball, so keep an eye out for their swings and watch your back for the other enemy at all times.\n\n## Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top Spirit\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Two in One**\n* Equipped Effect: Significantly increases Defense, but moderately reduces Attack.\n\nThe Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top Spirit allows you to take the form of both enemies, who stick together to form the entire iron ball before smashing directly into your enemies three times over. The iron ball is extremely powerful, and the three full hits make the Spirit move even stronger.\n\nThe equipped effect is a double-edged sword, however. It boosts your Defense but at the cost of your Attack. This could be worth it for you, depending on your play style and how boosted your Attack is via the Skill Tree and your equipped weapon.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
