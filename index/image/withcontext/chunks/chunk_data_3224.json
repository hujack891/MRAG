Apparently he spoke to one of the rats, who said “our senior brother gave me a piece of gold. I’ll need it here when the time’s right.” He’ll then proclaim that the time is right, and will leave the temple.\"\n            - Following Text: \"This “senior brother” is the First Prince of Flowing Sand — aka the giant rat Yaoguai Chief that you can fight in the Valley of Despair on the road from Sandgate Village to the Crouching Tiger Temple. If you didn’t kill the rat king, he’ll summon the prince to fight you. Otherwise, you can use the Pungent Flesh Chunk to summon and defeat him yourself. He’ll drop the Arhat Gold Piece when defeated, which is the gold the Boar needs.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
