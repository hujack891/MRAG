The Keeper of the Flaming Mountains is a master of deception and uses his Yin-Yang ability to produce more than just the Yin-Yang Fish in this showdown.\n\n\nFrom The Emerald Hall Keeper's Shrine, go left and up the stairs. A cutscene will start to play, where you'll transform into a Cicada and fly toward the center of the hall. This is where you'll find Pingping speaking to her mother, Rakshasi, accompanied by the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains.\n\nAfter they discuss The Destined One obtaining the relics, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains offers to care for Rakshashi, which Pingping protests. After he binds Pingping, Rakshashi is revealed to be Zhu Bajie transformed and it's time to take on the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains for yourself.\n\n## Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and Yin-Yang Fish Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe white revenants are large enemies with clubs, while the black revenants are archers. These are the ones you want to target, as their ranged attacks can be annoying and do the most damage. Clear these revenants out as quickly as possible, to get it back to a fight against just the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains.\n\nWhen you've got his health down to around 30%, Zhu Bajie will leave you to take him on one-on-one. The aim is still to just attack normally to get his health bar down quickly.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When he's almost dead, he will then summon Ma Tianba for you to fight against.\n\n### Missable Transformation Spell\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, at the start of Furnace Valley there is a dead cart. You need to pull the string and exhaust the dialogue from the horse guai Ma Tianba before you defeat him in this fight. Otherwise, you will miss out on the Dark Thunder Transformation Spell. Once you've beaten the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and the Yin-Yang Fish, return to the cart and pull the string to get the Transformation Spell.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
