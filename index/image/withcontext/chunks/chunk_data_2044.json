The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems.\n\n\nAs you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple. A long slope here will send you down to a large arena, and its here you'll have your second and final encounter with an old foe - the Venom Daoist.\n\n\nBefore you do, you should also head through the nearby gateway to find a large field with a giant tree in the middle. Off on the right, you can find a wooden ledge overlooking the mountains with a **Treasure Chest** full of random materials and a Soul Remigration Pill.\n\n## Court of Illumination\n\nAfter you've completed Purple Cloud Mountain, head back to the Court of Illumination Shrine. If you haven't stopped here to get the Shrine earlier, you'll need to take out two Spear Daoists, but also note a small pond of water with a Tiger Sheriff down inside, along with a green Wisp. Defeating him should also get you a special **Tiger Tendon Belt Curio** (if not, it may randomly drop from other Tiger Sheriffs).\"\n            - Following Text: \"Now at the Court of Illumination Shrine, you'll find a pathway straight ahead, and another to the right leading to a large field. The doorway to the right leads to the final boss, so first take a quick detour up the stairs.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
