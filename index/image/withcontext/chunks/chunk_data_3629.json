With this item, you’ll be able to unlock the boss.\n\n## Cyan Loong Boss Fight and Guide\n\nAnother dangerous attack he can launch with little warning only comes with a small tell -- when he quickly swaps his sword to hold in a reverse grip behind his back. He'll then quickly launch himself through the air at you with a spinning slash that can take a chunk off your health, and then dive back to your position after a moment for sword slice when he reaches the ground.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The good news is his final sword slice allows for an extended moment to dodge around and attack him from behind. However, you'll need to keep your eyes open when trying to attack from behind, as he can easily whip his mace-like tail around to hit you.
