Moves like this will take him a moment to get up from the slam, giving you a good amount of time to start a light combo on him.\n\nHe can also quickly employ two different two-punch strikes — one that you’ll want to punish, and other avoid. If he starts with an uppercut and downward fist slam, he’ll pause for a moment to shake off his fist from the force of the impact, which is your time to shine and lay into him.\"\n            - Following Text: \"However, if he starts with a right hook and then a delayed forward moving punch with his left, he’ll always follow up with a quick leg sweep as he bounds away to safety, making it an unwise move to try and counter, unless you’re playing things safe with a long-ranged jab from the Thrusting Stance.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
