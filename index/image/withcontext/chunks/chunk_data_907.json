This frog boss is the final of the six you can find across the chapters.\n\n\nWhen you get to the edge, look down to see a muddy clearing. Down here, you can find the next optional boss, which is the final frog Lang-Baw-Baw.\n\n## Lang-Baw-Baw Boss Fight and Guide\n\nExpect to see him using rocks like shockwaves, where he'll punch the ground and disturb the ground underneath you, and also call rocks up into the air. When this happens, he'll roar and send them hurtling toward you. Another variation of a rock attack he performs is that a circle of rocks will spike up from the ground on occasion.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The key is to get him out of this state as soon as possible because it can be an annoying fight otherwise. It's easy to be killed when you're being bombarded with rock attacks in this phase. You can perform heavy attacks when he's in this phase, and you'll knock him flat and still do plenty of damage. But the best thing you can do is throw out the Plantain Fan. He'll go back to being red immediately, and be repeatedly pushed back. Stick close to him when the fan is hitting to keep attacking.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.
