This character will ask you to complete a side quest for him that will unlock Chapter 2’s Secret Area: The Kingdom of Sahali.\n\n\nIn this large open field, you’ll find a friendly boar-like Guai resting on a rock. He’s apparently extremely inebriated, and needs you to help him find something to sober him up. He’ll mention “**Windrest** ” if you talk to him again, providing a clue to where you can find such an ingredient.\n\n\nOn the left side when looking at the large building, defeat a Blazebone monster, and then look to the right for a **small alcove** , where you can spot a **glowing pot**. Break the pot, and you’ll find the **Sobering Stone**.\n\n\nThis “senior brother” is the First Prince of Flowing Sands — aka the giant rat Yaoguai Chief that you can fight in the **Valley of Despair** on the road from Sandgate Village to the **Crouching Tiger Temple**. If you didn’t kill the rat king, **he’ll summon the prince to fight you**. Otherwise, you can use the **Pungent Flesh Chunk** to summon and defeat him yourself.\n\nHe’ll drop the **Arhat Gold Piece** when defeated, which is the gold the Boar needs.\n\n\nThough he doesn’t say where he’s going, the Boar will actually return to **near where you first met him** at the **Rockrest Flat** area of the Fright Cliff. However, instead of sitting on a rock, he’ll now be standing over by the stairs leading to a large door you can’t access yet.\n\nUnfortunately, he’s not too pleased that you’re in possession of the gold, and the Yellow-Robed Squire will challenge you to a duel!\n\n## Boss Fight - Yellow-Robed Squire\n\nIf you try to pull back too far away from him, he also has a few more sandy surprises. Instead of crafting a ring blade, he can also summon a spear of sand behind his back that glows as it appears, and then he’ll launch it at you extremely fast.\"\n            - Following Text: \"A good tactic to employ for this fight is to use the Thrust Stance’s retreating move after a combo when his sand comes out, and then follow up with a heavy thrust attack at range. It will move you out of the blinding sand, and also away from most of his claw swipe attacks. Without the sand masking his moves, he’s not overly tough, and you’ll be able to best him in this duel.\n\nUpon defeat, he’ll relent and offer to let you join him in exploring the Realm of Gold together, before vanishing off behind the giant gate. You’ll also earn the Snout Mask head gear, which has an interesting effect on raising and lowering attack power based on gourd use.\n\nOnce you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into **Chapter 2’s Secret Area: The Kingdom of Sahali**.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
