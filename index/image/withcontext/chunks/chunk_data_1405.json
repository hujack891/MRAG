A large terrifying sound will echo throughout the realm, the pagoda itself will spin even faster, everyone will start glowing, strange new creatures will appear -- and your health will start lowering!\nLet's break it down: The Pagoda Realm's chanting curse is on a global timer, meaning even if you die or go to different Shines in the realm, or even sit around resting at a shrine, the curse can still trigger and persist. **Every three minutes, the chanting will begin, and last for exactly one minute and thirty seconds before resetting.**\"\n            - Following Text: \"During this time, your maximum health will be halved! However, there is a silver lining: The curse will actually slowly refill your entire health bar before starting to lower your maximum health bar (but will still account for damage you've taken if you're currently in a fight and not regenerate past that point). As an added caveat, both the Destined One and all other enemies in the Pagoda Realm will start to glow red. This not only makes enemies easier to spot, but also grants everyone a considerable damage boost -- which can be blessing or a curse depending on who you are facing.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
