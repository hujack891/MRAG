Instead of landing from the hop, he’ll spring out his legs with surprising reach to perform a frog leg kick with massive power, and can use it twice in a row!\"\n            - Following Text: \"Finally, he can unleash a tongue attack that sweeps back and forth with a large reach several times, and will require you to dodge back and forth out of its path — or use your Immobilize to stop him in the act.
