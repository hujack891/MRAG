Not to be confused with his brother, the Tiger Vanguard of the Crouching Tiger Temple, you can only reach this boss by following the trail of a ghostly boy using the Old Rattle-Drum Key Item.\n\n* Rewards: Mad Tiger Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Yaoguai Core x1, Stone Spirit x1, 1102 Experience, 1023 Will, Plaguebane Gourd (in chest)\n\n\nUsing the Rattle-Drum here one final time will cause the spirit of the boy to appear before you, and invite you to hop down the well to meet a “friend”. Unfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there.\n\n## Mad Tiger Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nExpect this fight to take a lot of practice, and considerable upgrades in skills on your part to deal enough damage to survive the fight. While most Rock Solid deflections won’t be enough to stop him, retaliating with charged heavy strikes or crashing an Immobilize can sometimes stagger him several times and give you several openings. Using the Azure Dust Transformation is also useful to soak up his most damaging combos and retaliate with heavy charged hits to take chunks off his health.\n\nKeep practicing against dodging his moves, finding the right times to deflect the end of his combos (or just use Cloud Step to get out of the way) and always watch carefully when you stagger him to avoid his rising grab. Having the concoction to increase your max health can be beneficial if you’re unable to evade his grab or lengthy combos.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When at last the Mad Tiger falls before you, he’ll release his Mad Tiger Spirit for you to absorb, and drop a Blood of the Iron Bull, Yaoguai Core, Stone Spirit, and 1,023 Will. Be sure to also search the bottom of the well carefully, and you can find a large wooden chest that holds the Plaguebane Gourd!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
