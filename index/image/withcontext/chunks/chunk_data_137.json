The Poison Chief can be found here.\n\n\nThankfully, each of the Poison Chief fights is pretty much the same. You can expect the same moveset and should prepare for them in the same way.\n\nWhen the second Poison Chief is down, return to the Rhino Watch Slope and then head into the area with the flames on the ground. A cutscene will play out as you get there, and the Gold Armored Rhino will appear.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Gold Armored Rhino\"\n            - Following Text: \"The key to making this fight as easy as possible is to break the Rhino's horn.
