After a delay, he'll begin slashing the air in your direction, unleashing a low projectile wave followed by a diagonal slash wave, and then charge up his sword before jabbing it ahead to send a beam of lightning straight at you. It's better to keep your distance the moment you see him charging up, then dodge the three blasts before moving back in to fight.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Finally, if he sheathes his sword entirely to concentrate on sending his electric talismans at you, prepare for a length barrage. As he performs a gesture with his hands low, he'll bring them up as he explodes with energy, and then send a salvo of electric talismans flying at you.\n\nIf caught off guard, it's very hard to escape them once you first get staggered, but if you see the attack coming, step back and refresh your stamina, and then start spinning your staff to deflect the barrage until he's done.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
