He has four legs with mouths embedded in each knee. These mouths can spew flames on demand that create a swirling vortex of fire when the Clay Vajra stomps around in a circle. The best way to combat this is to either stay far out of the flame's reach or as close as possible between two legs so the flames can't hit you. Since the Clay Vajra spins during this attack, you will have to stay on the move as well to continue avoiding the flames.\n\nIts knees are, unfortunately, not the only place the Clay Vajra can summon flames from. Flames will also rip through the creature's chest in a burst of fire. The Clay Vajra hunches over before this move, so keep an eye on it to find out when to dodge the onslaught.\n\nIn addition to its knees and belly, the Clay Vajra is also armed with a fork-like weapon that it uses to stab and swipe at you.\n\n## Clay Vajra Spirit\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Flames of Doom**\n* Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Burn Resistance.\n\nClay Vajra's Spirit Power allows you to take his form and use the signature flaming knee move that you will have experienced during your fight with him. This move hits enemies from all sides, so you can even damage foes behind you. Having the Clay Vajra equipped also boosts your Burn Resistance, which can be extremely handy in areas like the Flaming Mountains.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
