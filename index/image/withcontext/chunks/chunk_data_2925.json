Located at the far end of the Fright Cliff, you'll first have to fetch several items for this Drunken Boar before you can fight him to unlock a Secret Area.\n\n* **Rewards:** Snout Mask, 1102 Experience, 1037 Will\n\n\nFinally, the Yellow-Robed Squire will return to near where you first met him, looking for a missing Gold Piece held by one of the Rat Princes. You can find this by defeating the First Prince of Flowing Sands in the Valley of Despair, and obtaning the Arhat Gold Piece from him. Return to Rockrest Flat, and the boar will fight you for the gold.\n\n## Yellow-Robed Squire Boss Fight and Guide\n\nAnother common attack combo he will perform will be to drag his claws slowly through the ground and pull them upward to attack and spread sand — which you can easily spot and deflect to interrupt him. If you don’t, he’ll charge forward through the sand to stab with his extended claws.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If you notice him throw out sand and then raise his hand high while it begins to glow, be ready for him to summon his secret weapon — a large bladed ring with barbs that he can employ for the rest of his combo.\n\nCertain times, he’ll start with a large downward slash, and then follow up after a delay with a second jumping slash attack, and then one final pivoting slash attack before it disappears into sand. As his health gets slower, he’ll add summoning the ring blade to his other combo attacks, but they can still be parried with Rock Solid.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
