Getting to the boss, however, requires finding a key item that you can't get until Chapter 2. This isn't the only Loong boss you can find in the game, so if you want to access the secret area, and know the whereabouts of the Loong Dragon Bosses, here's everything you need to know.\n\n* How to Get the Loong Scales\n* How to Find the Chapter 1 Secret Dragon Boss\n* How to Find the Chapter 2 Secret Boss\n* How to Find Chapter 3 Dragon Boss\n* How to Find the Chapter 4 Secret Boss\n\n## How to Get the Loong Scales\n\nThe item you're looking for is the **Loong Scales** , and they're cleverly hidden away just beyond Sandgate Village. After the mini-boss fight against the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, follow the golden trail to find the next Keeper's Shrine. From here, enter the nearby cave.\n\nIn the main room of this cave, you'll find a pit, and near it is a wall where a section has lots of tiny statues carved into it. You'll need to **break this wall to reveal a crack** that will allow you to squeeze through it. Inside, you can find the Loong Scales in a treasure chest.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Breaking the wall is a little bit trickier than it seems because it requires **an especially powerful attack** , and what happens in the pit also depends on how the fight with the King of Flowing Sands went. You'll either see a cutscene if you let him live or need to use a Pungent Flesh Chunk to get the First Prince of Flowing Sands to appear if you killed him.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
