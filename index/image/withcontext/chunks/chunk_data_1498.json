Inside is an Abomination in the corner, as well as an empowered Enslaved Yaksha you can defeat to gain the Enslaved Yaksha Spirit. Defeat them both and help yourself to a **Treasure Chest** in the corner full of materials.\n\n\nThe cell beyond will require you to have beaten Captain Lotus-Vision to unlock, and holds a **Treasure Chest** with materials in addition to the Wisp on the ledge, guarded by another Red-Haired Yaksha.\n\n\nFinally, wait until the distressing chants begin and curse you one last time, and a final Lantern Sentry on this level will appear nearby. If you defeat him (and have defeated all the other Lantern Sentries in the Pagoda Realm), he'll drop the **Auspicious Lantern Curio** , which allows you to trigger the \"chant-beguiling\" effect of this prison at will when using Cloud Step.\n\n\nAs you head back to the shrine before the next big boss fight, now is a good time to take stock on what you've gained thus far.\n\n* Be sure to spend all your will by cultivating chosen spirits, and crafting a strong weapon, either the Loongwreathe Staff if you've defeated both the Red Loong and Black Loong in Chapter 1 and 2, or the Kang-Jin Staff which can deal electric damage if you have the right skils unlocked for Punishing Downpour.\n* Travel back to the Shen Monkey and upgrade your Gourd's healing capabilities, and stock up on whatever new items he's selling.\n* Make sure to keep Cloud Step equipped over Rock Solid, as it'll be equally worthwhile for this boss as it was for the last.\n\nWhen you're ready, it's time to stop that awful chanting once and for all by heading into the pagoda itself.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Captain Wise-Voice\n\nWhen Captain Wise-Voice finally falls to your assault, the Pagoda Realm will at last be free of his beguiling chant. This means you can head down to re-explore if you missed any areas without worrying about the debuff (but it also means any Sentry Lanterns not killed are gone forever).\"\n            - Following Text: \"Like Captain Lotus-Vision, you'll also get The Spirit of Captain Wise-Voice that can't be cultivated. You can now step out through the opposite opening to exit this pagoda, and you can check the rim of the cliff to the left to find a **Treasure Chest** with materials inside.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
