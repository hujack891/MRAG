This Yaoguai Chief hides underground disguised as an innocent plant, and must be plucked in the Valley of Ecstasy.\n\n* **Rewards:** Old Ginseng Guai Spirit, Ginseng Cape, Millennium Ginseng Seeds, Blood of the Iron Bull, Cold Iron Leaves, Random Materials, 1562 Experience, 1477 Will\n\n## Where to Find The Old Ginseng Guai\n\nThe Old Ginseng Guai hides within the large Valley of Ecstasy region that you can reach after exploring past the Bitter Lake in The New West area. You'll need to stick to the main road through the Forest of Felicity to find a high ridge path, and take one of several exits on the left to enter the Towers of Karma area.\"\n            - Following Text: \"In the forested fields of the Towers of Karma, head to the back wall to find the titular stone monuments, and follow the path past the Shrine to the far corner of this area where a large monument is located in a muddy field surrounded by Aged Ginseng plants. Pluck them all, and you'll find the one in the center is actually a boss!\n\n### Old Ginseng Guai Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nThis hulking brute isn't as deadly as the Non-Able boss fight, but he does has a few tricks up his sleeve. As you might expect, he can deal a lot of damage with poisonous roots much like the lesser Ginsengling, so having antimiasma medicine on hand is a good strategy.\n\nMany of the Old Ginseng Guai's attacks are slow and hard-hitting, and the guai himself moves at a fairly slow pace, making him the perfect target for hit and run attacks as needed.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
