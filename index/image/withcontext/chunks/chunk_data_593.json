These are Buddha's Eyeballs and can be found in statues across Fright Cliff. On this page, you can find a breakdown of where to find each of the eyes, and where you need to deposit them to find the secret boss.\n\n## How to Find All Buddha's Eyes\n\nIn Chapter 2, you’ll come to the Fright Cliff and the Squall Hideout Keeper’s Shrine. Before you reach it, you’ll hear chanting, and see the glowing eyes in a Buddha Head that lays in the sand. Interacting with the Buddha Head will give you the Buddha Eyes Key Item, but there are actually more to find dotted around the landscape.\n\nHere’s how to find them all:\n\n* Buddha’s Eyes 1\n* Buddha’s Eyes 2\n* Buddha’s Eyes 3\n* Buddha’s Eyes 4\n* Buddha’s Eyes 5\n* Buddha’s Eyes 6\n\n\nAs you enter Fright Cliff from Sandgate Village, make your way up the hill toward the Squall Hideout Keeper’s Shrine. Before you reach it, you’ll go past the chanting Buddha Head on your right. Each one of the Buddha Heads has glowing yellow eyes. Interact with it to remove the Buddha’s Eyeball.\n\n\nGo over to the other side and climb up the stairs. Take out the enemies using ranged attacks, and climb to the very top of the structure to find the Buddha Head.\n\n\nLook down from the top of the structure where you found the Buddha’s Eyeball 2, and you’ll see the third one waiting for you down below.\n\n### Buddha’s Eyes 4\n\nOn the other side, you’ll see a wooden structure, and a path that goes into a cave. Head in here and look for the statue on the left. Take this turning first, to find a Buddha Head at the end with a Poisestone enemy.\"\n            - Following Text: \"\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
