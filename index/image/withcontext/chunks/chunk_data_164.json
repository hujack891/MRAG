Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby.\n\n\nAs you get close to the edge of the cliff, you'll find another clearing with a rock in the middle. This is the third Poison Chief in the region.\n\nWhen you've beaten the third Poison Chief, head over to the start of the red trees. As you enter the clearing with the lightning, you'll find the next Keeper's Shrine on the left.\n\n## Deer Sight Forest\n\nActivate the Deer Sight Forest Keeper's Shrine and go toward the lightning and red tree in the middle of the clearing. Underneath the tree sits the Cloudtreading Deer.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Cloudtreading Deer\n\nIn this phase, you'll need to avoid the pools of blood. There are also some projectiles, where little orbs of blood will float up in the air and then hone in on you. Thankfully, you'll have a little bit of help with this one, as Zhu Bajie will appear in the second phase to give you a hand.\"\n            - Following Text: \"This part of the fight is more about managing how long you can stand in the blood for, and jumping back out when you're about to be completely poisoned. Try to bait the deer to run out of the patches of blood, and into the ice where you can attack it freely. You can also use the Wind Vessel in this phase to down the deer temporarily.\n\nOnce the Cloudtreading Deer is down, you'll receive the Lotus Silk Cloudtreaders, and it's time to continue the sweep of the mountain.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
