Below you'll find a guide to accessing the kingdom of the past by undertaking the Drunk Boar's Questline to find a Sobering Stone, and how to defeat the Tiger Vanguard and secret Yaoguai King Boss, Fuban.\n\n* Jump to a Section:\n* **How to Access the Kingdom of Sahali**\n- Yaoguai Chief - \"Tiger Vanguard\"\n* **Sandgate Bound**\n- Yaoguai King - Fuban\n\nThis Chapter 2 Secret can only be accessed by meeting the Yellow-Robed Square in Fright Cliff (aka the Drunken Boar), and helping him in his search for the \"Realm of Gold\" which requires a few steps (and for you to best him in combat).\n\n\nOnce you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into the Kingdom of Sahali\n\n\nAs you round the corner, you’ll be told to halt by the defender of a large gate: A slightly familiar looking Tiger Guai who calls himself the Vanguard of the Yellow Wind King. If he looks familiar to another Vanguard you’ve faced, that’s because he’s actually the other Vanguard’s father! He’ll ask that you turn around and head home, which seems like such a waste with all you’ve gone through just to get here.\n\n\nUpon defeat, you’ll gain the **Tiger Tally** curio, and he’ll realize your prowess and invite you to meet his king.\n\n## Sandgate Bound\n\nPast the Tiger Vanguard, you’ll find a pretty staggeringly big open desert landscape for a Secret Area. There’s not as much to do as it may look like, but there are a few secrets worth picking up before talking to the big guy on the cliff.\"\n            - Following Text: \"There are more than a few plants to gather that are scattered around the upper plains here, including Licorice. If you move straight ahead, you can find the Sandgate Bound Shrine by some rocks before the large cliff.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
