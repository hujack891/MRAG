The leader of a gang of insect guai that have taken over Purple Cloud Mountain, he can only be reached by entering a secret area.\n\n* Rewards: Sky-Piercing Horn, Deathstinger (Material), Stained Jade Gourd, Fine Gold Thread, Mind Core, 3410 Experience, 2595 Will\n\n\nThe Scorpionlord is an optional Yaoguai King, and potentially one of the toughest bosses you'll face in Chapter 4, even though he is not required to complete the Secret Area of Purple Cloud Mountain. However, if you do not defeat him before defeating the actual final boss of this region, he may not be available afterwards.\n\nTo reach Purple Cloud Mountain, you will have to defeat the Venom Daoist twice - both in the Upper Webbed Hollow, and in a side path outside the Temple of Yellow Flowers main area. This will unlock a mural allowing you to travel to this new area.\n\nOnce you reach the first main shrine at the Valley of Blooms, keep to the right to find a pathway leading to the Bounds of Deity's Abode Shrine, and stairs up to where the Scorpionlord lounges drinking on top of a building.\n\nTo goad him into fighting, simply break any of the pots in the area around him.\n\n## The Scorpionlord Boss Fight and Guide\n\nIf everything mentioned already wasn't bad enough to deal with, things will only get harder the more damage you deal. Many of his attacks will gain extended combos, making it harder to predict when you'll next get a chance to get some damage in.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Expect him to add somersault flips with tail strikes or behind his back stabs into many of his combos at the very end, or immediately reset after his deathsting attack to start a new attack. In addition, many of his sting attacks that leaves poison along the ground will also erupt with geysers after a moment, requiring you to stay well away from the path of these attacks.\n\nFinding openings can be difficult, especially when Immobilize doesn't last long and deflecting anything but his more standard claw hits will just send you tumbling back.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
