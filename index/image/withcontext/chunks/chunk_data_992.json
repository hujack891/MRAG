Not to be confused with his brother, the Tiger Vanguard of the Crouching Tiger Temple, you can only reach this boss by following the trail of a ghostly boy using the Old Rattle-Drum Key Item.\n\n* Rewards: Mad Tiger Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Yaoguai Core x1, Stone Spirit x1, 1102 Experience, 1023 Will, Plaguebane Gourd (in chest)\n\n\nUsing the Rattle-Drum here one final time will cause the spirit of the boy to appear before you, and invite you to hop down the well to meet a “friend”. Unfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there.\n\n## Mad Tiger Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nHe may not have a sword, but the Mad Tiger’s fists work just fine, and can employ many combo attacks. His most common one starts with an uppercut punch, and then a downward strike after a short pause, and is then followed by a huge sweeping claw swipe that spins him around. If you want to try using Rock Solid, save it for the swipe so he doesn’t attack through his first two swings.\n\nAnnoyingly, he can also employ a similar strike with only the first two hits, but at a much more rapid pace.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He also has a different combo strike that often begins with a downward fist punch, followed by two large horizontal claw swipes that spin his body, and ends with him ripping his fist out of the ground in a rising swipe as he leaps backward with the momentum. Immobilize him before he can retreat if you want to retaliate.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.
