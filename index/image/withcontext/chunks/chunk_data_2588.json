Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nThe easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step. Cast it near the start of the rope bridge, and then sprint all the way to the other end, and don't try to staff spin if any arrows come your way, or you're likely to walk off the side by accident.\n\n## Relief of the Fallen Loong\n\nOff on the right side, there's a larger tree where you can find a **Luojia Fragrant Vine** above a pool of water, and then find a path leading up to the left.\n\nClimbing up the path, there's more Beetle Captains on the side of the road, before it curves to the left.\"\n            - Following Text: \"At this point, if you've collected the Loong Scales back in Chapter 2, a familiar voice will begin to speak, indicating that a secret Loong boss is not far away. Follow the voice past a large area littered with the remains of wooden treasure chests to find the local Shrine, and up ahead at the top of the cliffside path you can find what appears to be the Ancient Master standing under a pavilion.\n\nThis man is actually the Yellow Loong, who claims he's been hiding upon the Ancient Master's garb as a pattern. As the last of the secret Loong bosses, he is an incredibly tough battle, especially at this point in the game, so you may want to back off and challenge him when you've got some stronger gear! If you're able to meet the challenge, you'll claim more materials needed to craft the ultimate Loong Staff, as well as a **Golden Carp Curio** , and the **Golden Lining Spell** to transform into the Yellow Loong himself!\n\n* See the **Yellow Loong Boss Guide** for details on how to defeat him.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
