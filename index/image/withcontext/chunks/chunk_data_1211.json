Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n- Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\n\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\n\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n\n\nInside the side room, there's another large tree that a Supporter Monk is facing, but a Wolf Guardian will try to ambush you as you approach him. You can also find a Ginsengling around the tree roots by trying to harvest some Aged Ginseng.\n\nCarefully head through the open doorway into the side plaza, and look for a small alcove on the left for a green Wisp to absorb. However, once you begin to explore this area, a Yaoguai Chief will emerge from a nearby altar.\n\n\nThe large gateway at the end of this path is guarded by three Overseeing Monks, one apart from the others, but all can be lured away independently due to their short-range senses.\n\n\nAfter defeating them, you can spot a lone monk standing inside. This is the target of the Snow Fox's quest for revenge, and you can now use the Snow Fox Brush in your inventory to transform into The Fox, and step inside to trigger a cutscene (if you enter first you can speak to him, but transforming near the monk will instantly trigger the fight without a scene).\n\n\nOnce you've claimed the pill, hop up the other side of the frozen river to fight the Clay Vajra. Follow the path around the frozen river past where several Censor Holders are praying before a Dual-Blade Monk, and you'll find a **Treasure Chest** in front of a large stone monument near where the frozen river leads to the bridge you ran across earlier.\n\nNow you can return back to the Main Plaza, and this time head up past where you defeated the other Clay Vajra for its Spirit, and enter the last part of the temple.\n\n## Temple Inner Courtyard\n\nWhen they've been defeated, rest up at the Mahavira Hall Shrine, but be sure to head back down the stairs to the main floor. One side has a sealed door with a lone Thunder Rhino Master and a small pot with a green Wisp in it just to the side\"\n            - Following Text: \"The opposite side of the Courtyard has an open door leading to the last of Yellowbrow's disciples.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-Pure\n\nNon-Pure is a very aggressive fighter, similar to Non-Able, but instead uses a large sweeping monk spade to attack in long combo swings that can be difficult to escape from. Finding opportunities to get your own attacks in can be difficult, but you'll need to resist the urge to jump in too early or you'll be hit and staggered multiple times.\n\nGiven his long sweeping swings, having backup from A Pluck of Many or Spirits that summon other allies won't work as well as they'll tend to get hit even if he's focusing all his attention on you.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
