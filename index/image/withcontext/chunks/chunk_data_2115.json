The leader of a gang of insect guai that have taken over Purple Cloud Mountain, he can only be reached by entering a secret area.\n\n* Rewards: Sky-Piercing Horn, Deathstinger (Material), Stained Jade Gourd, Fine Gold Thread, Mind Core, 3410 Experience, 2595 Will\n\n\nThe Scorpionlord is an optional Yaoguai King, and potentially one of the toughest bosses you'll face in Chapter 4, even though he is not required to complete the Secret Area of Purple Cloud Mountain. However, if you do not defeat him before defeating the actual final boss of this region, he may not be available afterwards.\n\nTo reach Purple Cloud Mountain, you will have to defeat the Venom Daoist twice - both in the Upper Webbed Hollow, and in a side path outside the Temple of Yellow Flowers main area. This will unlock a mural allowing you to travel to this new area.\n\nOnce you reach the first main shrine at the Valley of Blooms, keep to the right to find a pathway leading to the Bounds of Deity's Abode Shrine, and stairs up to where the Scorpionlord lounges drinking on top of a building.\n\nTo goad him into fighting, simply break any of the pots in the area around him.\n\n## The Scorpionlord Boss Fight and Guide\n\nWhile your initial fight will start with him crouching down before launching a very long piercing tail strike, all subsequent attempts will begin with him whirling away from you, only to leap toward you fairly fast.\n\nJust like the Scorpion Prince, he'll slash at you with his claw while still airborne in front of you, but quickly follow up with a tailswipe to quickly spin about, letting him slam down with his claw for a third hit. As you can see, he'll be very tricky in alternating between his claw and tail, and you'll only have a second to see either appendage glow to know where his attack is coming from and react.\n\nOn the plus side, you can deflect his initial lunge with a Rock Solid Deflection, but be wary when using Immobilize, as he's prone to escaping faster than other bosses, so you'll need to follow with a strong hit or risk him breaking out to resume his combo attacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Do note that later on in the fight, he can bait you with this attack by whirling away and starting to leap, but extending his tail far head instead to stab you!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
