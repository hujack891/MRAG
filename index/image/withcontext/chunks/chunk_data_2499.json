The Wight is much tougher than any other bosses you can fight this early in the game, and while it is still possible to defeat them early, it is highly recommended that you level up further before taking them on.\n\n* Rewards: Wandering Wight Spirit, Cat’s Eye Beads, Stone Spirit, 691 Will, 1,049 Experience\n\n\nYou can find him in the Forest of Wolves area by proceeding straight from the Outside the Forest Shrine, and past an axe-wielding Wolf Guai across a small bridge to a large clearing where the hulking giant patrols back and forth. Due to his staggering size, he’s hard to miss!\n\n## Wandering Wight Boss Fight and Guide\n\nHowever, he’ll usually follow these stomps with a series of up to three spinning sweep attacks, twirling quickly in a large arc that will damage you unless you dodge at the right time. Since he may or may not follow up one spin with another, you’ll need to be very careful in figuring out when it’s okay to retaliate with an attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Even worse, some of his combos can add with him performing an extremely fast leaping stomp attack, which covers a good amount of distance and is hard to react to when the speed is much faster than his other stomps.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
