Hiding on the far side of Turtle Island this frozen boss can't be activated until you obtain a Key Item in the previous chapter. Cyan Loong is one of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n\n* Rewards: Tridacna Pendant, Thunderbone, Loong Pearl x1, Refined Iron Sand x2, Mind Core x1\n\n\nYou can enter the crack in the wall, and on the other side you’ll find a chest containing the Loong Scales. With this item, you’ll be able to unlock the boss.\n\n## Cyan Loong Boss Fight and Guide\n\nIn particular, we recommend the Red Tides transformation spell to evade around his attacks while burning him, as he swings are slow enough that you can have an easier time performing the wolf guai's ultimate spell attack for big damage.\n\nThis fight will largely come down to learning his moves enough that you can anticipate and avoid his powerful attacks, and find your opening to keep him staggered and on the defensive. Once you learn how to keep away from his sword swings, you'll be able to take him down for good.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When he falls, you'll earn some Fine Gold Thread and another Loong Pearl, and can loot a nearby chest that appears for the Mountain-Shaking Claw material and Breath of Fire Soak for your Gourd. This new material will unlock the upgrade path for your Loongwreathe Staff into the Golden Loong Staff, but you'll need to find and defeat the last of the four Loongs to craft it.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
