Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration.\n\n## Valley Entrance\n\nUltimately, you're going to go left to continue on the main path (and you may start to hear characters talk as you approach this pillar), but for now, you'll want to detour and explore the area to the right.\n\nThe first thing you'll see as you go to the right is the Flamlings that sit in the lava. These will spit fire at you, so it's best to deal with them to remove the ranged attacks while you explore.\n\n\nDrop down here, and head right first to collect the Fire Date from the tree. Then go in the opposite direction toward the lava streaming from the ceiling. This is where you can find one of the optional bosses in Chapter 5, the Flint Chief.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Flint Chief\n\nA lot of the moves will see the Chief attack with long sweeps or hitting the ground with its fists. Ripples of lava will often follow these attacks, so using the Fireproof Mantle will give you some protection against the fire damage.\"\n            - Following Text: \"There are three areas you can concentrate attacks, which are its body and two hands. It's best to target the two hands, as these are actually breakable and by removing them, the Flint Chief becomes a lot more unsteady on its feet. Focus combos, follow-ups, and heavy attacks on its hands to remove them as quickly as possible.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
