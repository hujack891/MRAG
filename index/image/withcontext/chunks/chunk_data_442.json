Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration.\n\n\nOpen the giant door at the top of the stairs. Go straight ahead and activate the Rakshasa Palace Keeper's Shrine.\n\n\nInside here, you'll find the old man who gave you the gourd at the start of the game and an Awaken Wine Worm to the left.\n\nSpeak to the old man, and he'll tell you to find yourself a decent gourd (if you haven't already upgraded yours fully) and you can share a drink with him.\n\n\n## The Emerald Hall\n\nFrom The Emerald Hall Keeper's Shrine, go left and up the stairs. A cutscene will start to play, where you'll transform into a Cicada and fly toward the center of the hall. This is where you'll find Pingping speaking to her mother, Rakshasi, accompanied by the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains.\n\nAfter they discuss The Destined One obtaining the relics, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains offers to care for Rakshashi, which Pingping protests. After he binds Pingping, Rakshashi is revealed to be Zhu Bajie transformed and it's time to take on the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains for yourself.\n\n\nWhen he's almost dead, he will then summon Ma Tianba for you to fight against.\n\n\nTake the stairs up to the right and follow these up and into the dark cave. Then go right again, and up the next set of stairs to find the Crimson-Silver Cart\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Crimson Silver Cart\n\nThe only real difference between this fight and the one with the previous carts is that the Crimson-Silver Cart has a wider area that it attacks in. Not only will it shoot flames out at the bottom all around it, but it will also roll around and try to mow you down.\n\nAs soon as you see smoke start to build around it, you'll want to move out of its way, because this is when the fire is coming. Beyond that, you'll also notice tweaks to the punching attacks. Rather than just slamming its fists down once, it will try to land a combo of punches.\n\nTo make the fight easier, use Immobilize to keep the cart locked in place. That way, you and the Pale-Axe Stalwart can work together to quickly whittle down its health.\"\n            - Following Text: \"After the fight, speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart again and exhaust his dialogue. Then go along the tree trunk near him to collect the green Wisps that sit on it.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
