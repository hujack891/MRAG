As a required boss fight, you'll encounter them blocking the path leading out of the Sandgate Village, connecting to both the Fright Cliff and Crouching Tiger Temple.\n\n* Rewards: Pungent Flesh Chunk, Second Rat Prince Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Yaoguai Core x2, Silk x2, Stone Spirit x1, 1102 Experience, 1014 Will\n\n\nFrom the Sandgate Village Area, head up and to the right from the Village Entrance Shrine, right from the sealed town gate to find a Rat Governor and two two-headed Rat Captains guarding a low valley. To their right is a large door you can open, triggering the boss fight.\n\n## King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nExpect his swings to hit harder and move faster, often hitting twice in a row in quick succession. If he jumps through the air past you, he’ll often go for a lunging sweeping strike that sends him sliding back past you, but gives you the opportunity to dodge alongside his strike to hit him where he ends up.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Another terrifying new move is for him to do a slow spin ending with a weapon toss right at you. He’ll quickly follow up with a leaping dive attack to reach his mace, and then pull it out of the ground and swing it forth, which should quell any thoughts of trying to attack at this point.\n\nIdeally, the lower you have his health before killing his father, the less time you’ll have to worry about this phase if you can rush him down. If you don’t kill his dad, he’ll scurry off as soon as the Second Prince falls. If not, you’ll be able to help yourself to the Second Prince’s Spirit, as well as a Pungent Flesh Chunk.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
