Located in the Temple of Yellow Flowers on a high hill, she hides among Monkey-Head Mushrooms.\n\n* Rewards: Fungiwoman Spirit, Monkey-Head Fungus Seed, Knot of Voidness, 1562 Experience, 1473 Will\n\n\nThe Fungiwoman is a hidden optional boss that hides like most other fungi guai. After reaching the entrance of the Temple of Yellow Flowers, proceed on the main path until you find a fork in the road, with the left path leading to the Court of Illumination.\n\nTake the right path instead, and climb a mountain path up to a high ridge, leading to a shack with several mushrooms around it. One of the Monkey-Head Fungus on the right will actually be the Fungiwoman in hiding.\n\n## Fungiwoman Beetle Boss Fight and Guide\n\nAnother move they share is their rapid spin attack that will seek you out. Keep your distance or use Immobilize to score free hits, and then wait until they fall dizzy to hit them with more attacks.\n\nFor all their extra health, they don't have too many more moves than a regular enemy, so keep on the offensive so they don't have a chance to sprout more spore projectiles, using Immobilize to lock them down and Rock Solid when they try to swipe at you with their staff.\n\nOnce defeated, you'll gain a Knot of Voidness, and a Monkey-Head Fungus Seed to take back to the Zodiac Village, as well as their Fungiwoman Spirit to absorb.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Be sure to check the shack on the far end before leaving, as you'll find the **Sunset of the Nine Skies Drink** sittng on a table, which will restore Qi as well as health!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
