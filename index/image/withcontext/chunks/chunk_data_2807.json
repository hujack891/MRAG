It comes with standard stats, little damage, and overall isn't much use beyond the initial opening moments of the game. Before long you will want to switch to one of the other Weapons.\n\nThe weapon has a basic 30 damage stat, with no additional critical hit chance bonus. It also doesn't have any unique effect.\"\n            - Following Text: \"With it being given to you at the beginning of Chapter 1 - Black Wind Mountain, you can't craft it. However, it can be crafted into a variety of other weapons as you progress.\n\nWeapons can be crafted throughout the game from the Shrines throughout the game's six chapters. Crafting weapons will require Will and various Crafting Materials from the game's locales and enemies.\n\nFor even more guides and tips on finding all the items in the game, be sure to check out our guide on all the Black Myth: Wukong Armor and Gear locations, as well as the Gourds, Curios, Vessels, and Transformation Spells locations.
