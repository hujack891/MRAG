As you near it, you can also spot a dragon man standing alone in the shallows. Zhu Bajie seems to know him, but as you approach, you'll be pulled into another boss fight.\n\n\nAs you head close to inspect the skull of the great snake, a Yaoguai Chief will fly down to intercept you: a much bigger version of the bats you've faced recently!\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Apramana Bat\n\nWhen on the ground, the Apramana Bat can slam its wings down, and create a huge gust of cold air that will billow out for an extended period. Evade this by dodging and sprinting to the side so you can perform a flank attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"It can also charge up its wings by twisting its body, and will launch into two or three spin attacks by waving its wings around in a vortex as it flies at you several times.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
