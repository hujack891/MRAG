Located at the end of the New Thunderclap Temple, you'll have to defeat him twice in a drawn out battle to claim the Sage's Relic he guards.\n\n* Rewards: Cosmo Radiance, Cold Iron Leaves x3, Fine Gold Thread x2, Gold Tree Core, Refined Iron Sand x2, Mind Core, 4330 Experience, 2267 Will\n\n\nAfter resting at the Mahavira Hall Shrine at the top of the stairs, be sure to take assessment of your gear. Cultivate your best Spirits, make sure you have a lot of pills on hand an craft a bunch of extra Shock-Quelling Powder (you're going to need it).\n\nYou should also have any anti-shock gear/curios/soaks on hand as well, along with whatever else can keep you alive for awhile. This final encounter is spread out into three distinct fights, and while you'll be able to respawn and pick up where you left off for the first two sections from the Shrine, the final section won't take you back to the Shrine.\n\n* First Encounter\n* Second Encounter\n\n\nYou'll need to defeat the Macaque Chief inside his magic sack to escape, whereupon you'll be transported to his floating shelf, and you'll be able to fight him one last time.\n\n## Yellowbrow Boss Fight (Second Encounter)\n\nThe one you'll likely encounter fairly early on is his new ability to cast himself in a gold-plated protection form.\n\nIn this form, your attacks will simply bounce off like the Tiger Vanguard's Stone Form, but he won't readily revert back, and continue to attack in this impervious form.\n\nInstead, you'll want to find openings to hit him back with a heavy attack. If you have any Focus Points stored up, you can briefly stagger him, but even without any focus points its a better alternative than getting knocked back trying to use a light attack. You can also try ingesting consumables that raise your focus for an easier time breaking his gold form.\"\n            - Following Text: \"After 2-3 heavy hits (or a single heavy strike with 3 focus points), his golden protection will shatter, and leave Yellowbrow stunned for an extended period of time.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
