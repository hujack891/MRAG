Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the grove and learning how to cultivate Spirits, accessing a secret realm, as well as how to defeat the many bosses of this area that include Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, Guangmou, and the Whiteclad Noble.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Back Hills**\n* **Snake Trail**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Guangmo\n* **Marsh of the White Mist**\n- Boss FIght - Whiteclad Noble\n\n\nTo advance, keep heading up the stairway to cross the high bridge over the falls, where you’ll soon see the golden trail of a nearby shrine beckoning you left. Before making that turn, be sure to look to the right to find a small wooden gazebo with a small table, and open the small gold box on top to find a variety of medicines, including 2 **Tiger Subduing Pellets** , 1 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 1 **Amplification Pellet**.\n\n## Snake Trail\n\nThis path leads to a marshy swamp area full of tall white reed flowers. Several Croaky enemies hide within them, so use your lock-on to identify them so you aren’t ambushed. However, as you make your way through the marsh toward a large stone mural in the cliffs, an optional mini-boss will leap out to fight you.\n\n\nTo proceed, look for a small dirt path lined by a few fires through the bamboo grove to a set of statues on either side of a small opening in the walls. On the other side, another large bamboo grove is home to a humble yet deadly Yaoguai Chief.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Guangmou\n\nGuangmou is one of the more tricky fights you’ll have faced so far, relying on a variety of sneaky projectile attacks to keep you on the defensive and limit your ability to pursue him. Though he’s not technically a snake, you will find yourself in danger of being poisoned during this fight, so you may want to buy a few anti-poison medicine from the Shrine’s shop.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He’ll almost always begin the fight by summoning a cluster of homing ghostly projectiles that burst out of him before tracking you down. You can avoid the group by dodging to the side, or holding down your staff spin until they’ve been deflected.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
