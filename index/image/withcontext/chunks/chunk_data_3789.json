Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Ashen Pass III**\n- Boss Fight - Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n* **Cooling Slope**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n- Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\n* **Fallen Furnace Crater**\n- Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n- Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\n\nAfter defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the Yin-Yang Fish, and the Crimson-Silver Cart, you'll have climbed to the top of the Flaming Mountains and be closer to finding out where the Bull King is.\n\n## Ashen Pass III\n\nBefore you continue along the path, face the Ashen Pass III Keeper's Shrine and turn to the right. You'll see a Purple Lingzhi to harvest and another mushroom in the center of the clearing. When you pull this second one, you'll be confronted by the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai, which is an optional boss.\n\n### Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n\nHe uses a spiked mace to attack and generally will perform a series of combos where he'll swing the mace, or leap up in the air and smash it down.\n\nThough these are fairly standard attacks, in the sense that they can be dodged and evaded, the problem with them is the small red mushrooms that appear with each one.\"\n            - Following Text: \"These tiny red mushrooms will appear in any area that his attack lands -- including on you. If they start to grow on you, they'll reduce your movement significantly. This doesn't affect dodging, however, just walking. The biggest problem with this is that as you move around, the red mushrooms will appear on the floor around you and continue to explode, so you'll need to keep moving.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",

It introduces the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai as an optional boss encountered after harvesting a mushroom in the clearing near the Keeper's Shrine. The boss wields a spiked mace and performs combos involving swings and aerial attacks.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai, a grotesque humanoid creature with mushroom-like growths on its body, wielding a large spiked mace. The environment is a barren, rocky battlefield with scattered red mushrooms and fiery effects, emphasizing the boss's fungal and explosive attack mechanics. The visual suggests a tense combat scenario in the Ashen Pass III area.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text elaborates on the mechanics of the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai's attacks. Red mushrooms appear wherever the boss's attacks land, including on the player, reducing movement speed but not dodging ability.
