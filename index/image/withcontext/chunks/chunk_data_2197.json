Heavy Attacks Work Differently\n\n            Context:\n            - Preceding Text: \"# Things Black Myth Wukong Doesn't Tell You\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong comes with an in-game journal with some hints and tips but even if you read the know-how and wisdom sections, there’s plenty that the game lets you figure out on your own. To give you a helping hand, here are some things that Black Myth: Wukong doesn’t tell you.\n\n**Jump to:**\n\n* 1. Keepers Shrines Will Keep Expanding\n* 2. Always Speak to NPCs\n* 3. It’s Really Easy to Reset Your Skills\n* 4. Additional Combat Styles Can Be Unlocked in the Skills Menu\n* 5. You Can Pick Up Missed Spirits at Keepers Shrines\n* 6. There’s No Penalties for Dying\n* 7. Not All Items Are What They Appear to Be\n* 8. Look for Enemies With Blue Glowing Outlines\n* 9. It Pays to Backtrack\n* 10. Meditation Spots Grant Skill Points\n* 11. Heavy Attacks Work Differently\n* 12. Enter Photo Mode in Alternate Ways\n* 13. Get Permanent Upgrades with Celestial Medicines\n\n\nFinally, it's important to note that all the Keeper's Shrines in a chapter share the same wares in the Store menu, but the offerings will differ in the next chapter, so always stock up before heading to the next big area. The only exception are marked \"Secret Areas\" you can unlock in a chapter -- find a Shrine in these places and check their shop for items you won't find elsewhere!\n\n\nMost NPCs will remain in the area you find them, meaning you'll need to return to speak to them if they provide a service like selling goods or upgrading your Gourd. Other characters may show up in future chapters, provided you met them in previous chapters.\n\nBe sure to head back at the start of every new chapter to see if a merchant's stock has upgraded with new features!\n\n\nOnce you defeat a boss at the end of a chapter and earn one of the Six Relics of the Great Sage, you'll be given the option to awaken a single passive talent. These can also be reset in the Reignite the Sparks Menu, but you'll need to select the correct tab for Relics!\n\n\nEach Stance can be invested in to serve different purposes -- for example, only the Smash Stance can interrupt an enemy attack with a well-timed Varied Combo, provided you unlock the required skill. The Pillar Stance can allow you to gain height while charging your heavy attack, and even nullify ground-based attacks! Other stances can help attack enemies from a safe distance, or hit multiple enemies with wider area-of-effect attacks! If you're having trouble against a tough enemy, try out other stances!\n\n\nIf you ran into any Green Wisps early in Chapter 1 that only seemed to give a bit of Will before floating away, come back once you have the Gourd upgraded in the Bamboo Forest, and they can now be properly absorbed for much larger amounts of Will!\n\n\nThankfully, if you die in Black Myth: Wukong, there are no penalties. You won’t drop items or any of the Will you’ve collected, you’ll just need to face off against any enemies you’ve already encountered. When you die, you’ll simply be transported back to the last Keeper’s Shrine you interacted with and have to run the gauntlet again.\n\n\nSometimes, when you’re gathering a mushroom or plucking a flower from the ground you’ll also find an enemy attached to it. So be prepared that sometimes when you’re foraging, you’ll also need to take down an enemy that emerges from the ground if you really want the item.\n\nHarvest a material enough times, and you may randomly get something else, like a Soak for your Gourd or Seeds to harvest more plants!\n\n\nWhen you’re exploring areas, you’ll sometimes encounter enemies that have bright blue glowing outlines around them. These enemies drop spirits, which you can add to your collection and equip at any time to help you out during fights.\n\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong is full of secrets, and you’ll quickly learn that backtracking and revisiting previous places and even Chapters is essential if you want to experience everything. Missing an entry from your notebook or have a feeling that a place holds a secret? It’s always worth returning to explore again, particularly after you’ve gained new key items.\n\nSometimes this can be the key to unlocking hidden places and finding secret bosses. It’s also worth going back to NPCs and to previously visited shrine stores to see if they have new stock.\n\n\nEach region has a number of Meditation Spots to uncover and every time you take a quiet moment to reflect, you’ll gain Sparks. If you want to unlock all those skills quickly, it’s worth tracking down every Meditation Spot and enjoying a moment of calm.\n\n### 11\\. Heavy Attacks Work Differently\n\nNote that the Smash Stance heavy attack is the best for single target damage, and that you can run while charging it, but it has by far the worst range.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The pillar stance heavy attack is quite slow, but does big AOE damage and can knock enemies flying off ledges.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
