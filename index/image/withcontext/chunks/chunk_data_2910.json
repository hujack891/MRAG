He's the final boss of the Chapter, so expect a challenging fight.\n\n\nThis fight will begin immediately after finishing the fight against Red Boy.\n\n## Yaksha King Boss Fight and Guide\n\nAfter knocking down a chunk of his health, there will be times when he starts to switch to using just one blade. You'll know when this is about to happen, as only one blade will glow brightly, while the other will be dimmed. When he does this, this will mean that the blade will be able to reach much further, and he'll create huge extended arcs with it. He often does this in chains of three and will start to say a word like \"Merciless\" or \"Sheathless\" before each attack. You'll want to learn the timings of this attack, so you can dodge and roll right underneath it each time.\"\n            - Following Text: \"In the second part of the fight, he'll become much more aggressive. This will also be when Zhu Bajie leaves the fight. He won't only swing the blade around himself like he did in the first portion of the fight, but he'll also swing the sword overhead and land it down in front of him. When he does this, he'll send out a trail of the grass-like blades. You can dodge the long arcs in the same way you did for the first part of the fight, and dodge side to side to avoid the trail of blades.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
