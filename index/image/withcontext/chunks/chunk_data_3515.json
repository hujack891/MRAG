Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the grove and learning how to cultivate Spirits, accessing a secret realm, as well as how to defeat the many bosses of this area that include Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, Guangmou, and the Whiteclad Noble.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Back Hills**\n* **Snake Trail**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Guangmo\n* **Marsh of the White Mist**\n- Boss FIght - Whiteclad Noble\n\n\nTo advance, keep heading up the stairway to cross the high bridge over the falls, where you’ll soon see the golden trail of a nearby shrine beckoning you left. Before making that turn, be sure to look to the right to find a small wooden gazebo with a small table, and open the small gold box on top to find a variety of medicines, including 2 **Tiger Subduing Pellets** , 1 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 1 **Amplification Pellet**.\n\n\nAnother good strategy to note is that if you’re in danger of getting close to becoming poisoned, using the Red Tides spell can help you transform out of danger. Any status effects suffered while transformed as Guangzhi will be removed when you regain your regular health bar. As an added bonus, Guangmou will even comment on your transformation.\n\nOnce you’ve learned how to evade his projectiles, the rest of the fight will just boil down to chasing him down and stunning him however you can with Immobilize, your Spirit Attack, and other heavy hits. When he falls, you’ll gain Guangmou’s Spirit to add to your collection, allowing you to summon venomous snakes of your own!\n\n\nWhen you’re ready to move on, make sure you’re fully healed up from dealing with that snake, as the end of this downward path leads to the titular marsh where a very strong boss waits to block your path.\n\n## Boss Fight - Whiteclad Noble\n\nThis snake-like noble will attempt to test your resolve, and he’s got the skills to back it up, so don’t take this boss lightly. Oddly enough, despite his appearance, he doesn’t employ any poison attacks, so having the Celestial Lotus Seeds as your gourd’s Soak is the better option for this fight.\n\nThe Whiteclad Noble opts instead to attack with his strong spear, and can harness the power of water itself to amplify its reach. He’ll use it often to create waves of watery force you’ll need to dodge or suffer a lot of damage from. He’s also not above simply tossing his spear at you, and then calling it back to his hand.\"\n            - Following Text: \"This boss usually begins the battle with a jumping lunge attack, but is also highly mobile and will retreat without warning to reposition himself. Get your hits in when able, but be wary as you pursue his retreats. His jumping lunge can be used when he dodges and strafes around you, so be on your guard whenever he starts to move around the arena quickly.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
