There are a few other enemies to contend with at the same time, so cast Immobilize or A Pluck of Many to help deal with the others so you can focus on the Puppet Tick.\n\n## Puppet Tick Spirit\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Bursting Spiders**\n* Equipped Effect: Considerably reduces the Mana cost for A Pluck of Many.\n\nThe Puppet Tick's Spirit allows you to take the form of the hunched-over beetle and summon two spider minions to attack your enemies alongside you. These spiders explode into a puff of poison, inflicting any foes who were standing a little too close. The equipped effect is very good in this case, reducing the Mana cost for A Pluck of Many. A Pluck of Many uses a good chunk of Mana, more than many other spells. If you use it a lot, this Spirit could be very useful.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
