You’ll also meet the owner of the voice on the wind - the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain.\n\nThis friendly guy will be your guide and mentor for this part of the world, and will bid you to set out in search of Guanyin Temple, which burned down long ago but has since been rebuilt - but not by human hands. As the Keeper departs, he’ll bestow you with the Incense Trail Talisman, which can let you warp back to the last Shrine you rested at.\n\n\nOpposite the balcony, you can spot some torches marking a tunnel passage into the rocks. Delve inside to find a familiar golden trail leading to the next Shrine. Now that you’ve grown, so to has the Shrine’s options, as you’ll be able to set Spells to your quickbar, reset your Skill Tree if you wish to experiment, and start buying and selling things at the store:\n\nBlack Wind Mountain Shrine Store\n| Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store          | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store    | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store  | Black Wind Mountain Shrine Store |\n| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| Evil Repelling Medicament (x3) - 270 Will | Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Antimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will |                                  |\n| Yarn (x4) - 300 Will                      | Stone Spirit (x4) - 450 Will        |                                   |                                  |\n| Aged Ginseng (x5) - 90 Will               | Purple Lingzhi (x5) - 90 Will       | Gentian (x5) - 90 Will            | Jade Lotus (x5) - 90 Will        |\n| Snake-Head Mushroom (x5) - 120 Will       |                                     |                                   |                                  |\n\nSince you can’t craft medicine yet, you probably don’t need to be buying ingredients, but the medicines offered here are fairly rare to find in this chapter, so it won’t hurt to buy a few of each, and then sell any Pieces of Gold you’ve found.\n\n## Outside the Forest\n\nThe far side of the stream has many more materials to collect, and most importantly, a path leading from the bridge where the archer was to a small archway where another extremely important yet optional mini-boss awaits you.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Guangzhi\n\nAt range, he can still be a major problem as you learn his moves, as he can strike from a distance with very little warning. If you see him somersault backward and out of range of your strikes, don’t blindly rush in. He’ll pause for a moment, and then toss his twinblade at you like a boomerang that requires dodging as it spins toward you, and back to his hand.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He can also prepare a flourish before holding his weapon straight up at his side while in a small crouch. If you notice this new stance, be ready to dodge the instant he moves, as he’ll dash forward at an alarming speed, and then dash back to his original spot to try and catch you off-guard.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
