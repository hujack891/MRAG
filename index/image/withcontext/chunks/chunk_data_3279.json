However, you'll only be able to access it in Chapter 5 after completing all the secret areas in the game. We'd recommend waiting until you've finished Chapter 6 of the game and beat it before you visit Mount Mei, due to it being a vital place to see for the secret ending of the game.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **How to Unlock Mount Mei**\n* **How to Enter Mount Mei from The Great Pagoda**\n* **Mount Mei**\n- Erlang, The Sacred Divinity\n- The Four Heavenly Kings\n- Erlang Shen\n\n\nThere are several steps you need to take to unlock Mount Mei. You can find a detailed breakdown on our dedicated page: How to Unlock the Secret Ending (True Ending). But here's a quick rundown of everything you'll need to do by Chapter 6 to reach it.\n\n1. Complete the Chapter 1 secret area of the Ancient Guanyin Temple\n2. Complete the Chapter 2 secret area of the Kingdom of Sahali\n3. Complete the Green-Capped Martialist/Treasure Hunter quest in Chapter 3\n4. Complete the Chapter 4 secret area of the Purple Cloud Mountain\n5. Complete the Chapter 5 secret area of Bishui Cave\n6. Return to **The Great Pagoda in Chapter 3**. You can find it on the Snow-Veiled Trail in the Pagoda Realm.\n\n\nWhen you’re in The Great Pagoda, you’ll see tapestries around the room. One tapestry, at the very top of the room, will be red. Head for this, and a cutscene will begin where the small Buddha from Chapter 3 will be waiting for you. He'll open the tapestry and let you into Mount Mei.\n\n\nWhen you're through the tapestry, head up the stairs and follow the path. About halfway up you'll need to shimmy across a ledge on the left to reach the other side, then you'll continue up to the Mei-Jian Peak Keeper's Shrine.\n\n## Mei-Jian Peak\n\nHere is where you'll need to get your gear together before you go up to the tip of the mountain, where you'll be entering a boss battle against a familiar face.\n\n\nAfter crash landing back on Mount Mei, two giants will emerge. This is the Destined One's Stone Monkey form and Erlang Shen. When Erlang is thrown off into the distance, you'll be thrown into a fight against the Four Heavenly Kings.\n\n\nAbout halfway through the fight, you'll also be able to start using Ice Bath. When you use the Ice Bath Spell, the Stone Monkey's arms will be covered in frost, and when you punch, you'll inflict frost damage.\n\nWhen the Four Heavenly Kings have been taken down, there's just one more giant to deal with, which is Erlang Shen.\n\n### Erlang Shen\"\n            - Following Text: \"You should similarly approach the fight to the Four Heavenly Kings, and use Primal Punch to build up your Focus. When it's built up, use Earthshatter Slam to replenish your health and perform a heavy attack, and keep Rock Solid for moments when you can deflect Erlang Shen's blade attack.\n\nWhen Erlang Shen's health reaches around 70%, he'll imbue his sword with fire, and start to use it as a whip. This will make the fight a bit tougher, but you'll replenish your health whenever you use Eartshatter Slam. Be sure to use Ice Bath to counter these fire attacks.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4.
