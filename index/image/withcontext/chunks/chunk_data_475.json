You can find it at the Rhino Watch Slope, which the Feng-Tail General will conveniently take you to.\n\n## How to Find Gold Armored Rhino\n\nOnce you've completed the stamina and health test from the Feng-Tail General, drop down from it and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire.\n\n### Gold Armored Rhino Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThough you can do damage by hitting the Rhino in other areas, there’s little point in doing so unless you want the fight to last a long time. If you miss hitting the horn, you can still attack it. Avoid hitting its face and instead focus on hitting it from behind. This will annoy it, and it will buck to try and kick you with its back legs.\n\nBut if you’re holding charge to build it up, wait until the Rhino is coming toward you or pauses for a moment, and then unleash the attack. One of the best times to hit is when it's moving slowly, with sparks appearing around its horn.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Unfortunately, it won't be very long until lots of lightning starts to appear around the Rhino. When this happens, it will rear up and more lightning will start to strike the ground all around the field. This means that the horn is about to regrow, and you'll need to prepare to break it again.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
