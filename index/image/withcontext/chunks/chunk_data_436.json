Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration.\n\n\nOpen the giant door at the top of the stairs. Go straight ahead and activate the Rakshasa Palace Keeper's Shrine.\n\n\nInside here, you'll find the old man who gave you the gourd at the start of the game and an Awaken Wine Worm to the left.\n\nSpeak to the old man, and he'll tell you to find yourself a decent gourd (if you haven't already upgraded yours fully) and you can share a drink with him.\n\n\n## The Emerald Hall\n\nFrom The Emerald Hall Keeper's Shrine, go left and up the stairs. A cutscene will start to play, where you'll transform into a Cicada and fly toward the center of the hall. This is where you'll find Pingping speaking to her mother, Rakshasi, accompanied by the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains.\n\nAfter they discuss The Destined One obtaining the relics, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains offers to care for Rakshashi, which Pingping protests. After he binds Pingping, Rakshashi is revealed to be Zhu Bajie transformed and it's time to take on the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains for yourself.\n\n\nWhen he's almost dead, he will then summon Ma Tianba for you to fight against.\n\n### Missable Transformation Spell\n\nTurn and face away from the altar. There are two places you'll want to go here to get collectibles. First, head to the stairs, but take the small path down to the right. Follow this to find a golden turtle, where you can get the Slumbering Beetle Husk.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Then go back to the stairs and head for the balcony (facing opposite the altar in The Emerald Hall).
