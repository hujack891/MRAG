The leader of a gang of insect guai that have taken over Purple Cloud Mountain, he can only be reached by entering a secret area.\n\n* Rewards: Sky-Piercing Horn, Deathstinger (Material), Stained Jade Gourd, Fine Gold Thread, Mind Core, 3410 Experience, 2595 Will\n\n\nThe Scorpionlord is an optional Yaoguai King, and potentially one of the toughest bosses you'll face in Chapter 4, even though he is not required to complete the Secret Area of Purple Cloud Mountain. However, if you do not defeat him before defeating the actual final boss of this region, he may not be available afterwards.\n\nTo reach Purple Cloud Mountain, you will have to defeat the Venom Daoist twice - both in the Upper Webbed Hollow, and in a side path outside the Temple of Yellow Flowers main area. This will unlock a mural allowing you to travel to this new area.\n\nOnce you reach the first main shrine at the Valley of Blooms, keep to the right to find a pathway leading to the Bounds of Deity's Abode Shrine, and stairs up to where the Scorpionlord lounges drinking on top of a building.\n\nTo goad him into fighting, simply break any of the pots in the area around him.\n\n## The Scorpionlord Boss Fight and Guide\n\nHe can also run toward you and dive into the ground, forcing you to lose your lock on as he waits below ground for a moment before busting out to attack as he erupts forth. Don't get greedy after he appears, as he will usually follow his re-entry with a quick tail swipe that can turn into a grab if it connects, and immediately inject a large dose of poison into you while also dealing massive damage.\"\n            - Following Text: \"You'll also need to be ready to deal with a variety of claw swipes he can employ: Some come in two slow slashes as he staggers about, while another comes in a series of quick downward slams before he pauses for one final slam that can throw off your timing.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
