You're right above where you crossed the wooden beam, meaning the strange chamber you saw through the window is also right below you, and it houses a very important but optional Yaoguai Chief. Defeating him will be the key to unlocking the purple seals you've spotted all over this realm, but it's also worth pointing out that until you defeat the Yaoguai King of this area, you'll have to defeat this optional boss with the chanting curse sapping half your health at any point.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If you're up for the challenge, carefully drop down onto a rooftop in the pit below to avoid taking fall damage, then jump onto rocky rubble below to face this foe.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Captain Lotus-Vision\n\nOne of four Captains of the Pagoda Realm, Captain Lotus-Vision is responsible for sealing many of the prison cells, and must be defeated before you can unlock them. He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
