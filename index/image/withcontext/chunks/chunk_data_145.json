Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n\nNow drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby.\n\n## Rhino Watch Slope\n\nIn the midst of the trees, there's a small patch of ground with no grass. The Poison Chief can be found here.\n\n\nThankfully, each of the Poison Chief fights is pretty much the same. You can expect the same moveset and should prepare for them in the same way.\n\nWhen the second Poison Chief is down, return to the Rhino Watch Slope and then head into the area with the flames on the ground. A cutscene will play out as you get there, and the Gold Armored Rhino will appear.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Gold Armored Rhino\n\nFly up again when the battle is done and head for the edge of the cliff (the opposite side to the Keeper's Shrine and where you entered the fight).\"\n            - Following Text: \"When you get to the edge, look down to see a muddy clearing.
