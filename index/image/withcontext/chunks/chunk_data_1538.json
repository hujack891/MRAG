After defeating the imposing Stalwart, you'll be asked to complete a side quest for him.\n\n\nBefore you go over to them, harvest the **Fire Bellflower** by the Buddha statue on the right. Then, go straight up and into the midst of the fighting, to find the Pale-Axe Stalwart taking on nearby Revenants. Alongside the fighting, the area is also being pelted with firebombs so having the Fireproof Mantle Vessel here can help you focus more on the fighting and less on the fire attacks.\n\n## Pale-Axe Stalwart Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe health bar for the Pale-Axe Stalwart will appear as soon as you approach the open area. There will be Revenants and Bull Soldiers fighting around you, but you can ignore these and focus solely on the Pale-Axe Stalwart for this miniboss fight.\"\n            - Following Text: \"He uses a huge axe, so most of his attacks are slow swings. The main approach to this fight should be to dodge the slow attacks, then immediately follow up with a combo as he takes time to recover.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
