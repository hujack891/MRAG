Below you'll find a guide for the Valley of Ecstasy Region, including how to reach the valley itself by defeating Non-White, and exploring the different parts of the valley to uncover several Yaoguai Chiefs on the path to the New Thunderclap Temple, and completing the Treasure Hunter's Quest and the Pagoda Realm Prisoner's Quest by defeating the final Captain.\n\n- **Jump to a Section:**\n- **Mindfulness Cliff**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White (Round Two)\n- **Forest of Felicity**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- **Brook of Bliss**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Able\n- **Towers of Karma**\n- Yauoguai Chief - Old Ginseng Guai\n- **Longevity Road**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Captain Kalpa-Wave\n\nAfter you solved the monk's riddle by praying at four Buddha Statues in the Precept Corridor, you'll split up from Zhu Bajie and make your way into the belly button of a large Buddha statue along the cliffs, taking you up a narrow pathway and into the Mindfulness Cliff.\n\n\nFrom the Shrine, you'll find yourself at the edge of a large pit with a pathway spiraling around its edge.\n\nHowever, as you begin to head up the path around the pit, you'll be interrupted by the arrival of a jester-like figure who wants to wear your face.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-White\n\nAnother of his dangerous combo moves will start with a quick shout and an upward thrust of his blade followed by a quick jab. He'll then adopt a strange pose by lifting a leg up, only to dash at you with extreme speed for a final two-hit strike that can be dodged or deflected to get him off-balance.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If you spot him twirl his blade up behind him, be ready for a quick dash forward as he slashes upward, and then slams down to create a trail of ice in front of him. Thankfully, unlike some of the other moves, this will lead him wide open if you dodge to his side and strike back.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
