Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n- Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\n\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\n\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n\n## Temple Entrance\n\nBehind the mage, you can spot a new enemy standing by a sealed doorway. These Overseeing Monks are an interesting enemy - they really are blind, and will often shift about when they sense you approach. However, once you attack, they'll immediately begin to counter with powerful martial arts, which can sometimes extend for several powerful attacks in a row.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The good news is that they largely remain stationary, meaning you can easily stop a few feet away and charge a full heavy thrust attack to knock them flat, and then follow up with a quick light combo as they stagger to their feet.\n\nOnce this monk has been defeated, check the corner of this snowdrift for a green Wisp to absorb.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
