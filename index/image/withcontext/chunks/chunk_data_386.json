Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration.\n\n## Valley Entrance\n\nUltimately, you're going to go left to continue on the main path (and you may start to hear characters talk as you approach this pillar), but for now, you'll want to detour and explore the area to the right.\n\nThe first thing you'll see as you go to the right is the Flamlings that sit in the lava. These will spit fire at you, so it's best to deal with them to remove the ranged attacks while you explore.\n\n### A Note on Flamlings\n\nFlamings will drop Flame Ores, which are an important item needed for a secret boss later on in the Chapter, so be sure to tackle each Flamling you find.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Go for the one on the left first, then continue straight up. Another Flamling will emerge as you tackle this first one, so head for this one straight after. If you keep pushing forward, another batch of Flamlings will emerge, so we'd recommend taking them all down before you head over to the left side of the room and hop into the stream of lava.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
