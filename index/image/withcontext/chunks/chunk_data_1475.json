Inside is an Abomination in the corner, as well as an empowered Enslaved Yaksha you can defeat to gain the Enslaved Yaksha Spirit. Defeat them both and help yourself to a **Treasure Chest** in the corner full of materials.\n\n\nThe cell beyond will require you to have beaten Captain Lotus-Vision to unlock, and holds a **Treasure Chest** with materials in addition to the Wisp on the ledge, guarded by another Red-Haired Yaksha.\n\n## Upper Pagoda (Level 4)\n\nThis enemy is built fairly tough, and can launch themselves high up to slice the air with their fan to create projectiles to slash your way.\n\nWhen he descends back to the ground, use Immobilize to keep him pinned down as you press the attack, and use Spirit attacks to keep him staggered. Be ready for him to flap his wings to push your back or create whirlwinds as he flies up.\n\nThe Falcon man can also use a slow two-handed overhand swing in melee range, or at a distance to create giant tornadoes hurtling your way.\"\n            - Following Text: \"His most dangerous attack is a repeated spinning divebomb attack he can perform repeatedly to dash at you from all angles. Once you get the timing down, a Rock Solid deflection can stop him cold, or you can Cloud Step to the side and retaliate as he flies past.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
