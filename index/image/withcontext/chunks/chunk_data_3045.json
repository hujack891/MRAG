Clear out the foes, and then open it to find a **Copper Pill** Soak for your Gourd. This one in particular has an impressive effect to negate the cost of Rock Solid when used soon after using the gourd.\n\n\nOpen the large gate the Rat Imperial Guard were posted at, and head through to the other side. Be sure to look to the right as you open the gate, and you’ll find a tree with glowing flowers on it. Gather the **Luojia Fragrant Vine** , and be sure to return to the Shen Monkey later to improve your Gourd when you can!\n\nWatch out for another Lingzhiling in disguise nearby from the fragrant vine, and then travel up the path (check a small cave on the left for a green Wisp) and up to the Windrest Hamlet Shrine.\n\n\nShould you manage to best him in combat, he’ll offer to help you unlock this “Realm of Gold”, and open the doorway up the stairs that will lead you to another memory - a Secret Area known as the **Kingdom of Sahali**.\n\nWe highly recommend checking this place out before taking on the Chapter 2 Boss, as much like Chapter 1, its reward can greatly help you in that battle, and you’ll also find a Meditation Spot in this secret area!\n\n## Windseal Gate\n\nUnfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there. You can interact with the well to drop down to a secret area, where you’ll face off against an incredibly tough and dangerous Mad Tiger Miniboss (who may even be tougher than all the other Tigers you’ve faced)!\n\nReturning to the second spot you played the Rattle-Drum in Yellow Wind Formation, cross the rope bridge and you’ll contend with a few more Weasel Captains.\n\nRounding the corner, you can spot a large tree in the distance with telltale glow of a collectible hanging from it, but guarding it is a very creepy and unique miniboss.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Gore-Eye Daoist\n\nThe most annoying part will be when he hunches over and starts to mumble. Lines of red will start appearing from the eyes on his back toward each of the blood pools he’s created, and will essentially suck the pools back in and regenerate a portion of health. Stop him the moment you see this with a well timed Immobilize, or try a Spirit with a mighty attack to stagger him out of it, otherwise the fight will just go on longer.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Try to keep him boxed in if possible — getting his back stuck to a wall can severely limit how much blood he can expel from his eyeballs, and stop the projectiles from seeking you out. Use stunning, staggering, and heavy hits to keep him off-balance and unable to cast his spells, and he’ll fall before long.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
