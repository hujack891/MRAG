On the opposite side of the circular forest, you can spot two small statues forming an entrance into the grove where Guagnmou lurks.\n\n### Guangmou Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nGuangmou is one of the more tricky fights you’ll have faced so far, relying on a variety of sneaky projectile attacks to keep you on the defensive and limit your ability to pursue him. Though he’s not technically a snake, you will find yourself in danger of being poisoned during this fight, so you may want to buy a few anti-poison medicine from the Shrine’s shop.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
