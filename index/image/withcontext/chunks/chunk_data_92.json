This is the second of the stone bosses in Chapter 5, and another that will drop a Samadhi Fire Crystal.\n\n\nAs you enter the Cooling Slope for the first time, there are two points of interest to take note of. Up ahead, there's a smattering of rocks. And to the left, there's a Luoija Fragrant Vine. The rocks are the Flint Vanguard boss.\n\n## Flint Vanguard Boss Fight and Guide\n\nWhen it comes to the Flint Vanguard, the main thing to watch out for is its thick rocky arms. It will punch down using these, creating pools of lava where they land. To counter these attacks, use Body-Cooling Powder and your Fireproof Mantle.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Whenever you're close to the Flint Vanguard, it will go into combo punches. These are typical punches to the ground, and occasionally it will slam both arms down together. These can be dodged, and you'll be able to keep close to the Vanguard temporarily until pools of lava appear -- that's when you want to dash away.\n\nIt shifts to ranged attacks when you try to create distance, in the form of fireballs. This will just be a single shot each time, so it's easiest to dodge. It will also attempt to close the gap by flying over to you and smashing down.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
