Inside is an Abomination in the corner, as well as an empowered Enslaved Yaksha you can defeat to gain the Enslaved Yaksha Spirit. Defeat them both and help yourself to a **Treasure Chest** in the corner full of materials.\n\n\nThe cell beyond will require you to have beaten Captain Lotus-Vision to unlock, and holds a **Treasure Chest** with materials in addition to the Wisp on the ledge, guarded by another Red-Haired Yaksha.\n\n\nFinally, wait until the distressing chants begin and curse you one last time, and a final Lantern Sentry on this level will appear nearby. If you defeat him (and have defeated all the other Lantern Sentries in the Pagoda Realm), he'll drop the **Auspicious Lantern Curio** , which allows you to trigger the \"chant-beguiling\" effect of this prison at will when using Cloud Step.\n\n\nAs you head back to the shrine before the next big boss fight, now is a good time to take stock on what you've gained thus far.\n\n* Be sure to spend all your will by cultivating chosen spirits, and crafting a strong weapon, either the Loongwreathe Staff if you've defeated both the Red Loong and Black Loong in Chapter 1 and 2, or the Kang-Jin Staff which can deal electric damage if you have the right skils unlocked for Punishing Downpour.\n* Travel back to the Shen Monkey and upgrade your Gourd's healing capabilities, and stock up on whatever new items he's selling.\n* Make sure to keep Cloud Step equipped over Rock Solid, as it'll be equally worthwhile for this boss as it was for the last.\n\nWhen you're ready, it's time to stop that awful chanting once and for all by heading into the pagoda itself.\n\n\nLike Captain Lotus-Vision, you'll also get The Spirit of Captain Wise-Voice that can't be cultivated. You can now step out through the opposite opening to exit this pagoda, and you can check the rim of the cliff to the left to find a **Treasure Chest** with materials inside.\n\n\nJust past him, you'll find a long stone staircase to ascend and chase the golden trail of a nearby Shrine. Grab the green Wisp as you make the climb, and at the end you'll find the next checkpoint.\n\n\nBefore you head in, be sure to explore the bottom of the stairway for a small narrow path beyond. Check to the left of a small tunnel to find another Abomination guarding a **Treasure Chest** with materials, then head through (watching out for a Cyan Bat lurking above) to reach a dead end cliff overlooking the Grand Pagoda in the distance, and check the left side of the cliff to grab a green Wisp guarded by a Frozen Corpse.\n\n## Warding Temple\"\n            - Following Text: \"When you're ready and all rested up, head up into the Temple to follow the sounds of someone fighting. What you'll encounter inside seems to be a pretty one-sided fight, as the Macaque Chief you battled previously is trying in vain to get at the Wise Master you upgraded your Gourd. The Macaque seems unable to reach the man through the ring of fire that's been erected, so it'll be your job to teach this boss another lesson.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
