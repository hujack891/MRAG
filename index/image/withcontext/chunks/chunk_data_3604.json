Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the grove and learning how to cultivate Spirits, accessing a secret realm, as well as how to defeat the many bosses of this area that include Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, Guangmou, and the Whiteclad Noble.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Back Hills**\n* **Snake Trail**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Guangmo\n* **Marsh of the White Mist**\n- Boss FIght - Whiteclad Noble\n\n\nTo advance, keep heading up the stairway to cross the high bridge over the falls, where you’ll soon see the golden trail of a nearby shrine beckoning you left. Before making that turn, be sure to look to the right to find a small wooden gazebo with a small table, and open the small gold box on top to find a variety of medicines, including 2 **Tiger Subduing Pellets** , 1 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 1 **Amplification Pellet**.\n\n\nAnother good strategy to note is that if you’re in danger of getting close to becoming poisoned, using the Red Tides spell can help you transform out of danger. Any status effects suffered while transformed as Guangzhi will be removed when you regain your regular health bar. As an added bonus, Guangmou will even comment on your transformation.\n\nOnce you’ve learned how to evade his projectiles, the rest of the fight will just boil down to chasing him down and stunning him however you can with Immobilize, your Spirit Attack, and other heavy hits. When he falls, you’ll gain Guangmou’s Spirit to add to your collection, allowing you to summon venomous snakes of your own!\n\n\nWhen you’re ready to move on, make sure you’re fully healed up from dealing with that snake, as the end of this downward path leads to the titular marsh where a very strong boss waits to block your path.\n\n## Boss Fight - Whiteclad Noble\n\nInstead of the previous spear twirling to create waves of force, he’ll get more aggressive, and rise up out of the water to slash back and forth to create several diagonal waves that are a bit harder to dodge than his old vertical slices.\"\n            - Following Text: \"In addition to this, he can twirl his spear above his head, summoning water above it before slamming it down, sending a straight line of water right at you that you can dodge to the side to avoid.\n\nBeyond that, the rest of the second phase of this fight will come down to anticipating how his body twists before he unleashes his sweep attacks. Keep close and aggressive to dodge around to his sides, using your spells to amplify your attacks, and looking for the right moment to invoke your Spirit Attacks (the Wandering Wight is still a good choice when he’s stationary to flatten him).\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2.
