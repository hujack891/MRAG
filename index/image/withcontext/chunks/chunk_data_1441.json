This will result in dodging on top of dodging as you have to escape the constant laser, and also four different blasts, and a final blast from all four circles at once.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Because of the difficulty of this section (and that you may also be at half health from the chanting curse), we highly recommend using Cloud Step so at your decoy can draw fire for a large portion of this attack.\n\nAfter the four circles all emit their laser blasts, they'll float away from Captain Lotus-Vision to take up spots in each corner of the room. Each circle will emit a continuous laser that borders the room, and will slowly pan them around to cross over the floor and each other.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
