Below you'll find a guide for the second middle area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find an optional encounter against the Elder Amourworm, and how to get past the Centipede Guai and Right Hand of Buddha to reach the Lower Hollow.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* ** **Verdure Bridge\n- Yaoguai Chief - Elder Amourworm\n* **Middle Hollow**\n* **Bonevault**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Centipede Guai\n* **Cliff of Oblivion**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Buddha's Right Hand\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nSince she seems like a trustworthy sort, head on inside, and you'll indeed find a literal trove of **Treasure Chests**!\n\nLooting them all, you'll be able to obtain a Xiang River Goddess Gourd, Enhanced Ginseng Pellet Formula, Gold Ridge Beast, and Purple-Veined Peach Pit Soak, plus several materials like Fine Gold Thread!\n\nThat's not all you can find, as there's an exit beyond leading to an outdoor cliff full of tiny cocoons, where the mother of all worms awaits you.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Elder Amourworm\n\nIf the sticky webs weren't bad enough, its other main trick is the ability to shoot out globs of poison, that will stay on the ground for a short duration even if it misses you. The Elder Amourworm can shoot out these poison globs when facing you, but also when you try to attack from its back, making it dangerous no matter which direction you fight from.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Even when knocked down, it can behave erratically, wriggling and slamming down to splash out more poison from its sides before getting back up, which can sometimes limit where you can press your attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
