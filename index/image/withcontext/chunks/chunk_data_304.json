Instead use your Cloud Step to get around and sneak attack.\n\n## Squall Hideout\n\n\nThe large cave entrance has a few paths, with the outer one on the right leading past another Pitstone to a wooden coffin chest holding 3 **Silk** and some **Will**.\n\n\nStart by luring the shieldless Spearbone out of range of the Blazebones above, then climb the stairs to rush down the projectile throwers. Be sure to look at the ruined home at the first landing below the first Blazebone for a yellow chest that has 2 **Yaoguai Core** and 3 **Tiny Piece of Gold**.\n\n\nAt the end of the crevice, you’ll find an unusual looking stone. He’s actually a Man-in-Stone, and claims to have been trapped within the rock form. He’s betting on one of the rock guai in the large cave nearby to hold the secrets to reversing his fate, and asks you to seek it out.\n\n\nAt the end of the cave path, you’ll find the object of the Man-in-Stone’s quest - an even larger statue embedded with shining blue crystals. Don’t get too enraptured that you miss a Poisestone along the walls trying to ambush you, though.\n\nUpon reaching the end of the large cave system where you’ll find the Mother of Stones, look for a large opening to the right to exit back outside and onto a cliff edge. There’s a raised platform here, and you’ll find another statue head to harvest its Buddha Eyeball.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Mother of Stones\n\nOnce you hand it over, the Man-in-Stone will burst out of the ground and declare you gullible for just giving it to him. That’s not very nice, and it sounds like he deserves a beatdown.\"\n            - Following Text: \"While he technically has a boss health bar and everything, he’s kind of a pushover, barely having much more health than a regular Pinstone, and only doing their regular attacks anyway. Simply Immobilize him, rack up some Focus Points, and deliver a charged strike to send him packing.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
