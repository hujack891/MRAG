Most of his attacks are melee-based but he can shoot glowing projectiles out of both ends of his bow. The Red-Haired Yaksha is alone in the room where you fight him, so you can focus all your attention on him without having to worry about reinforcements. The Red-Haired Yaksha does wind up his moves, giving you enough time to predict and dodge them.\n\n## Red-Haired Yaksha Spirit Power\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Punishing Arrow**\n* Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Heavy Attack Damage.\n\nThe Red-Haired Yaksha's Spirit Power allows you to embody the Yaksha and release one strong arrow in your enemy's direction. The arrow deals a healthy amount of damage and can stagger the target, leaving you free to land another combo before they recover. Having the Red-Haired Yaksha equipped increases your Heavy Attack moderately, which is decent considering your Heavy Attack is already quite powerful.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
