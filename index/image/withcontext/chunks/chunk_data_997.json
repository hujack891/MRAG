Not to be confused with his brother, the Tiger Vanguard of the Crouching Tiger Temple, you can only reach this boss by following the trail of a ghostly boy using the Old Rattle-Drum Key Item.\n\n* Rewards: Mad Tiger Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Yaoguai Core x1, Stone Spirit x1, 1102 Experience, 1023 Will, Plaguebane Gourd (in chest)\n\n\nUsing the Rattle-Drum here one final time will cause the spirit of the boy to appear before you, and invite you to hop down the well to meet a “friend”. Unfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there.\n\n## Mad Tiger Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nAnother extremely deadly combo he can perform after a roar seems to last forever, making it an ideal time to try Immobilizing him or using a Transformation Spell if you’re in danger of dying from his assault. He’ll race around you before leaping close with a claw strike, followed with a delayed upward slash, and a second soon after, before keeping his arm raised for a moment and then punching down with two hits in quick succession, and a final delayed two-handed slam! Be sure you have enough stamina to keep up sustained dodging for this very long combo attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Another variant after his roar that’s a bit more rare to see — usually when you have some distance on him, is that he'll perform a longer bloodcurdling roar, and then shoot a projectile out of his mouth at you with little warning!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
