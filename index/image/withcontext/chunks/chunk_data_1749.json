Go right from The Purifying Spring Keeper's Choice and up the stairs and through the gap in the wall. Follow this path along to the right, and cross the bridge. Then turn left and look for the white sacs that block a path going down. Smash through these and go down here to find a Buddha head, where the monkey from previous chapters will be sitting. Once the monkey has run off, take the Skandha of Choice from the Buddha's head.\n\n\n* How to Find Yellow Loong\n\n\n* How to Find All Purple Talisman Altars in Chapter 4\n\n\n* How to Unlock the Chapter 4 Secret Area\n\n\nWe've listed the secret bosses in Purple Cloud Mountain in a particular order because players have reported that this is a missable encounter. For that reason, we'd recommend tackling the Scorpionlord first when you're in Purple Cloud Mountain.\n\n\nJust like The Scorpionlord, you won't be able to fight Daoist Mi if you head straight for The Duskveil. We'd recommend tackling him second, as you make you way up to Cloudnest Peak.\n\n## The Duskveil - Purple Cloud Mountain\"\n            - Following Text: \"Up at Cloudnest Peak, you'll find The Duskveil. This is the final boss of the secret area, so killing it will trigger a cutscene and transport you out of the area. You'll also receive the Weaver's Needle Vessel from completing this fight.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
