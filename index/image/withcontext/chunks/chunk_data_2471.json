Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of The Webbed Hollow: the Village of Lanxi, as well as how to navigate the town and defeat the Second Sister.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Estate of the Zhu**\n- Yaoguai Chief - The Second Sister\n\n\nHead down the sloping street and grab a green Wisp along the way, and you'll find yourself crossing a small bridge to a clearing with a shack covered in webs. Standing our front are two Grasshopper Guai that can strike extremely quickly, but aren't as durable as the Beetle Captain.\n\nClear them out with Zhu Bajie's help, and you'll find they were guarding a large **Treasure Chest** holding several consumables, which may include a Loong Aura Amplification Pellet, as well as a Knot of Voidness and Blood of the Iron Bull.\n\n\nJust up the stairs from the Shrine is a door, so once you've made all your purchases, upgraded gear, and given the Zodiac Village another visit, you can try knocking on the door.\n\nZhu Bajie will suggest a bit of subterfuge, disguising yourselves as the Wushan Lesser Guai who were hauling the chest at the start of the chapter. You'll be met by a shrewd woman, who will immediately figure out the little pig's disguise. She happens to have a disguise of her own, and will transform into her true self.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - The Second Sister\n\nFinally, she can also perform a small leap and extend her front legs forward like spears as she lands, which may cause you to try and backpedal, only for her to follow up by shooting a quick projectile at you immediately afterward, which is both hard to spot and dodge.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Her moves can get even more unpredictable when she's low on health, often peppering in quick poison projectiles from her mouth, or somersaulting forward to slash at you. Continue to use the Thrust Stance to keep her talons at bay, and when having trouble, always look for when her front legs subtly shift their shape to become more distinct blades to know when the attack is coming.\n\nWith Zhu Bajie backing you up (and you can always fall back to let him heal you), The Second Sister won't be able to stand against the two of you for long. After she's been defeated, she'll make a mad dash to flee, but not before flinging something at Zhu Bajie, who shrugs it off, and then runs ahead to chase her down.\n\nBefore you decide to give chase, let the little pig go and instead be sure to inspect the arena where you fought.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
