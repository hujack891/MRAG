The familiar duo of Yaoguai Chiefs can be found in the Chapter's secret area.\n\n\nTop Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top are located at the start of Bishui Cave. You'll need to find the Cooling Slope and defeat the Five Element Carts to gain access to the hidden area.\n\n* **See** **How to Unlock the Chapter 5 Secret Area.**\n\nAfter activating the first of the Keeper's Shrines, continue past it, following the path to the right.

As you reach the middle, you'll be met by the first of the bosses in this secret area.\n\n## Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top Boss Fight and Guide\n\nIt turns out that the spiked gold ball is hiding a secret inside, which is two minibosses for you to take on. They will both use a portion of the ball as a shield and have a sword to complement it.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Like the other pairs of bosses in the chapters, you'll have them attack you in succession. You'll start with Bottom Takes Top, who will cycle through two moves. He'll leap at you -- just dodge back from this -- and then roll into the ball. You can attack him while he regains his composure when he's inside it.\n\nTo follow this, he'll put his sword away, then jump at you and slam the ball down. He'll then drag it around him. Both of these attacks can be avoided by keeping your distance. Attack when he's getting himself back together, and chip away at his health steadily.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
