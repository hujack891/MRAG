Below, you'll find a Walkthrough for the first major area of The Flaming Mountains called Woods of Ember, as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* ** **Ashen Pass I\n- Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Brown-Iron Cart\n* **Camp of Seasons**\n* **Height of Ember**\n- Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones\n- Yoaguai Chief - Gray-Bronze Cart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind\n* **Ashen Pass II**\n\n\nInstead of finding him wherever you left him kneeling, you'll now see him by the edge of the cliff. As you come back down the stairs to the area where you fought him, you'll see a small set opposite with two Buddha statues on either side. Go up these and to the left, to find him overlooking the mountain. Talk to him and exhaust any new dialogue.\n\n## Camp of Seasons\n\nTurn right on the other side of the bridge, and start to head through the cave. On the right side of the cave is a green Wisp, but you'll first want to deal with the Revenant Charbone that will run at you as you step into the darkness. These things will cause fire damage and when you've knocked their health bar down, they'll explore. Take it out immediately and then pick up the Wisp, avoiding the explosion.\n\n### Tip!\n\nContinue forward, going across the bridge where another Revenant Archer waits for you on the other side. You'll also see a Lavabat hanging from a tree, and three Revenant Charbones kneeling around it. Clear this area, and harvest the **Purple Lingzhi** from underneath the tree. Then, go up the path behind it to the right.\"\n            - Following Text: \"At the top, a Lavabat will attack you as soon as you reach the area. On the right, you'll find another Bull Sergeant and two more Revenant Charbones. Clear this and then activate the **Height of Ember Keeper's Shrine** near the tree on the right.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
