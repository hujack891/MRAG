The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems.\n\n\nAs you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple. A long slope here will send you down to a large arena, and its here you'll have your second and final encounter with an old foe - the Venom Daoist.\n\n\nBefore you do, you should also head through the nearby gateway to find a large field with a giant tree in the middle. Off on the right, you can find a wooden ledge overlooking the mountains with a **Treasure Chest** full of random materials and a Soul Remigration Pill.\n\n\nHead back to the altar, and pluck what should be the fourth and final talisman. Before you can celebrate this act, a large winged monster with a hand for a face will appear to aggressively punish you for this deed!\n\n## Boss Fight - Supreme Inspector\n\nIf he takes to the air, play it safe and hang back, waiting to dodge when he divekicks his way back to you before trying to Immobilize and counter him.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If he tries to shoot out various wing-tip projectiles at you, don't panic and just use your staff spin to knock them all aside.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
