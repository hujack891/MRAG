An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n\nNow it’s time to finally open that door the Rat Captains were guarding. In the next scene, you’ll spot the next major boss fight: a tiny Rat King and his oversized son.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n\nHis overhead slam can similarly raise a line of fissures from the strike, making dodging to the side your best bet.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Expect his swings to hit harder and move faster, often hitting twice in a row in quick succession. If he jumps through the air past you, he’ll often go for a lunging sweeping strike that sends him sliding back past you, but gives you the opportunity to dodge alongside his strike to hit him where he ends up.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
