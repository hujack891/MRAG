After she explains that she's been captured, two giant heads will descend upon the arena.\n\n### Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind Boss Fight and Guide\n\nWhen Quick as Fire is down, the intensity of Fast as Wind's attacks will increase. He'll now start to charge at you, sweeping down as close as possible to the ground, to hit you with his tusks. The best counter to this is a dodge, which will see him hit the ground and get his tusks stuck for a few seconds.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Be ready to follow him and hit him as soon as this happens. Even when he pulls his tusks out from the ground, he'll be temporarily stunned, giving you enough time to attack. He will continue to chase you, blowing wind on you, but will also start to spit gusts of wind out. These will turn into small tornados but they're extremely short-lived, so as long as you can dodge the initial gust, you should be able to quickly get out of the way of the tornado.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
