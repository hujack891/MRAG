Below you'll find a guide for the first upper area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find your first encounter with the Venom Daoist, and the different ways to reach The Verdure Bridge.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Upper Hollow**\n* **Pool of Shattered Jade**\n- Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nBefore following the golden trail of a nearby Shrine, look to the left of the bed and small chest to find a path leading to another larger **Treasure Chest** you can open to claim a **Cuo Jin-Yin Belt Hook Curio** , another item that can help resist all the poison you'll be encountering.\n\n\nYou'll now find yourself on the opposite side of the Hollow from where you first started, with a group of platforms in front of you that offer a one-way ticket down to the start of the Middle Hollow and the Verdure Bridge. However, going down there now would cause to a miss a large optional area complete with a boss (but you can drop down early to grab the Shrine and warp back up if you want).\n\n\nCarefully carve a path through the Clawed Cocoons to reach the other side, and you'll find yourself in a large chamber with an even bigger cocoon hanging down from the middle. Something angry is muttering to itself inside, and its apparently waiting for you.\n\n## Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nBe ready for him to leap back with two more slashes after the dash, and wait until he returns to counter -- or simply Rock Solid his dash attack to stagger him back.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Attack his back when you can either by Immobilizing him or using Spirit Attacks for large area of effect hits, and you'll actually be able to start tearing apart his extra limbs, dealing massive damage in the process.\n\nWhen he starts to complain about this, be ready for more quick dashes as a retaliation strike. Still, he's not too great at adapting, since his attack with two jump slams will still cause him to expose his back when his swords are buried in the ground.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
