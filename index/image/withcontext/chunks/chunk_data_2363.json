Below you'll find a guide for the Valley of Ecstasy Region, including how to reach the valley itself by defeating Non-White, and exploring the different parts of the valley to uncover several Yaoguai Chiefs on the path to the New Thunderclap Temple, and completing the Treasure Hunter's Quest and the Pagoda Realm Prisoner's Quest by defeating the final Captain.\n\n- **Jump to a Section:**\n- **Mindfulness Cliff**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White (Round Two)\n- **Forest of Felicity**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- **Brook of Bliss**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Able\n- **Towers of Karma**\n- Yauoguai Chief - Old Ginseng Guai\n- **Longevity Road**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Captain Kalpa-Wave\n\nAfter you solved the monk's riddle by praying at four Buddha Statues in the Precept Corridor, you'll split up from Zhu Bajie and make your way into the belly button of a large Buddha statue along the cliffs, taking you up a narrow pathway and into the Mindfulness Cliff.\n\n\nFrom the Shrine, you'll find yourself at the edge of a large pit with a pathway spiraling around its edge.\n\nHowever, as you begin to head up the path around the pit, you'll be interrupted by the arrival of a jester-like figure who wants to wear your face.\n\n\nContinue taking the path back outside and up the cliffs to reach a large open area with an archway at the far end leading to a huge valley, and on the right you'll find Non-White at a Meditation Spot waiting for round two.\n\n\nBeyond this arena, you can head through an archway to see the giant titular Valley of Ecstasy below you. It's a one-way slide, and the region is about to get a whole lot bigger and confusing.\n\n\nBack at the Forest Shrine, look left from the main road to find two different passageways into a canyon. The passage before reaching the Shrine leads past a green Wisp you can absorb into a small pond where a new Frog Guai miniboss is waiting.\n\n\nSince the main path down below leads on to the Longevity Road, we'll instead head to the right side of the Forest Shrine where a hilltop is teeming with a few praying Frozen Corpses and various plants to harvest. There are two paths here -- one before the shrine, and one after the archway where the Fox Guai spoke to you, and both lead down to the next sub-region.\n\n\nJust past the crowd of Frozen Corpses, you'll find the most important thing in this region: A lone man bound and kneeling in front of a large stone pagoda on the hill above.\n\n\nThere's not much else to loot around the large stone pagoda where you fought Non-Able, so now is a good time to head back to the Forest of Felicity Shrine, and make your way through the canyon where the Frog Guai boss was to enter the next optional area.\n\n## Towers of Karma\n\nThis Circus Monkey will use its gong to rally the troops and alert any Frozen Corpses nearby to rise and ambush you. Luckily, he's not too strong on his own and can be taken out quickly before focusing on the others.\n\n### The Treasure Hunter's Quest - Continued\n\nBack at the Towers of Karma Shrine, look ahead to find a large series of statues carved into a wall with a new enemy standing in front of them. This fearsome foe is a Dual-Blade Monk, and has a lot of health and damaging moves (but thankfully won't respawn).\"\n            - Following Text: \"Be ready for him to toss his blades at you as they boomerang back to him, and then dart up close to attack low with sweeping cuts from his blades. Though he can perform long combos that end in powerful uppercuts, he's not immune to being greatly staggered from a well time Rock Solid, so wait for a good moment to upset his attacks and punish him.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
