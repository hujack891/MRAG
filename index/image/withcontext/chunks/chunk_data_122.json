Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n## Verdant Path\n\nContinue straight up from the Keeper's Shrine and into the clearing that's adorned by chains. Make your way into the center of the clearing, where Bajie will exclaim it's a dead end. However, you'll soon be joined by the Supreme Celestial Inspector. If you found all of the Purple Talismans in Chapter 4, then this will be a familiar face to you.\n\n\nWhen his health is down to the last third, he will cover the arena with a red haze, reducing the size of the arena that you'll fight the creature in. He will also begin to use two swords instead of one. This is when you want to throw out the Plantain Fan. It will clear the red haze immediately and continuously stun him, giving you more time to whittle down his health.\n\nAfter defeating the Supreme Inspector, he'll pick you up and fly off with you. This will lead to The Destined One learning to use Wukong's Somersault Cloud. To activate it, **press Down on the D-Pad or G if using a keyboard**.\n\nWhen the cutscene is over, you'll be at the edge of the cliff, so hop on to Somersault Cloud to get started exploring the area.\n\n\nFrom the edge of the cliff, look straight down to see a pool of water. Go down and to the center of this water to fight our first optional boss, Jiao-Loong of Waves.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Jiao-Loong of Waves\n\nWhen its health has been knocked down past the halfway mark, it will start to dive into the water where you won't be able to reach it. It will move underneath the surface to try and dive up and attack you. Look for where the water is rippling to work out where it'll emerge.\"\n            - Following Text: \"It will dive in and out a few times, then its huge tail will appear from the water to try and hit you. This will appear almost tentacle-like, and there can be overlap which means you're dodging more than one at once.\n\nThankfully, with a limited range of attacks and a fairly straightforward way to avoid them, Jiao-Loong of Waves shouldn't require too much to take it down. Don't feel the need to conserve your spells during this fight; take advantage of them to quickly take down this miniboss.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
