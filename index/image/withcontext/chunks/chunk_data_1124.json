You'll need to summon her with Fire Ore to make her appear, then you're in for a fight against her and her Flamlings.\n\n## How to Find Mother of Flamlings\n\nAs you head into the next barren section, you may notice the glow of a treasure chest up ahead. Be warned that there are also little glowing patches leading up to, and inside the next clearing, and these are all Flamlings. Clear them out before you go over to the chest, where you can collect Refined Iron Sand from it.\n\nWhen you've looted the chest, go around to the other side of the rock. There will be an open clearing here, that looks like it's empty. Again, remove any Flamlings from the area, then go to the center of the clearing. Here you'll find a larger glowing patch.\"\n            - Following Text: \"This is actually where you can summon a miniboss called the Mother of Flamlings, and to do so, all you need to give over is 4x Flame Ores. Thankfully, Flame Ores are dropped by Flamlings, so you'll hopefully have enough by this point to summon her immediately. Approach the glowing patch and deliver the Flame Ores.\n\n### Mother of Flamlings Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe ground will rumble as the Mother of Flamlings appears, and fireballs will be thrown out as soon as she bursts through the ground.
