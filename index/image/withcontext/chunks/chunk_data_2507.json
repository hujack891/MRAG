The Wight is much tougher than any other bosses you can fight this early in the game, and while it is still possible to defeat them early, it is highly recommended that you level up further before taking them on.\n\n* Rewards: Wandering Wight Spirit, Cat’s Eye Beads, Stone Spirit, 691 Will, 1,049 Experience\n\n\nYou can find him in the Forest of Wolves area by proceeding straight from the Outside the Forest Shrine, and past an axe-wielding Wolf Guai across a small bridge to a large clearing where the hulking giant patrols back and forth. Due to his staggering size, he’s hard to miss!\n\n\nIf you keep your distance and wait for the end of his growing earthquake explosions, don’t get too comfortable. The Wandering Wight will regularly end his series of explosions by rapidly moving his hands and charging up before blasting an energy wave directly at you. This will also deal massive damage, and you’ll need to begin strafing and time your dodge to the side to avoid its blast.\n\nIf you find yourself low on health and in danger of being defeated, remember that you can use the Red Tides Transformation Spell to turn into the Wolf Guai, which will grant you a new health bar to use for a limited time. Make the most of it by unleashing quick combos and continuing to dodge his strikes and build up Might, and then perform a special spell with a full Might bar by dodging an attack and then using the heavy attack button to perform an explosive pogo jump to take off a huge piece of his health!\n\nExpect this boss to take some time to defeat, as you can easily fall to any number of his attacks while you learn the timing to his sweeping spin attacks, hand blast, and earthquake tremors. Keep a watch on your stamina to know when to pull back and recharge, and use lulls in combat to replenish health when out of range of his earthquake.\n\nWhen the Wandering Wight finally falls, you’ll get the Cat’s Eye Beads Curio to equip for a passive bonus, as well as a Stone Spirit material and 691 Will.\n\n## How to Absorb Spirit With Guidance\n\nHe will also leave behind the Wandering Wight Spirit — a purple glowing wisp — for you to absorb. if you tried to defeat this boss early, interacting with it will prompt the note: \"Cannot Absorb Spirit Without Guidance\".\"\n            - Following Text: \"Luckily, you don't have too far to go gain this upgrade. This can only be done once you’ve met the Ancient Master in the Bamboo Grove who will upgrade your Gourd. If you haven’t done this yet, don’t worry — the Spirit will appear in your Shrine menu when attempting to Cultivate Spirits after the gourd has been upgraded.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
