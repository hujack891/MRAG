One of several possible frog guai bosses you can defeat, this one lurks in the Valley of Ecstasy, and has the power of frost on its side.\n\n* **Rewards:** Tadpole, Cold Iron Leaves, Random Materials, 1270 Experience, 904 Will\n\n## Where to Find Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n\nAs soon as you arrive in the Forest of Felicity, you can find two small tunnels in the ridge on the left, one before and after the Shrine, and both lead to a canyon with a frozen pond where the frog boss waits for you.\n\n### Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nLike the two Frog Guai before him, Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang is a formidable foe with surprising reach, and if you thought you'd seen everything a frog boss could do, you're sadly in for a surprise. Much as Chapter 2's frog boss was imbued with lightning attacks, so too does this boss have the power of ice on his side, and unless you take precautions, you'll be frozen solid and out of stamina -- unable to move while you're torn to pieces.\n\nHaving body warming medicine for this fight is a must, and it's highly recommended you equip the Frostspout Twig Curio, Fiery Gourd, and Circle of Fire Spell to offset his many frost-filled attacks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"While you've likely seen what a Frog boss can do with their extremely quick belly thrusts, rear kick attacks, and jump slashes, there's a lot of new tricks up this yaoguai chief's sleeve. Many of his moves, including his arm swipes that end with a slam, will now create a field of frost upon the frozen lake.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
