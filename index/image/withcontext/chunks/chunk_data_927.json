Found a little deeper into the game, it has a rather powerful buff, which can save your life in a fight or against a tough enemy.\n\nWith the Laurel Buds equipped, using the Gourd will moderately increase the damage reduction for a short duration of time. This duration is rather short, but it can be the difference between life and death in a pinch or one of the tougher boss fights in the game.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Soaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd itself, so you are stuck with the length of this damage reduction. It can't be increased, so, if you want to switch to a different Soak, be sure to head back to the Shen Monkey Vendor.\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Laurel Buds Location\n\nThe Laurel Buds can be found past the Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw boss to the left of the Sandgate Village - Village Entrance Shrine in Yellow Wind Ridge. Head towards where you will fight the King of Flowing Sand and Second Rat Prince. Just before that boss arena, you will see a statue.\n\nBy this statue, you can pick up the Laurel Buds.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
