First located along the North Shore of the Bitter Lake, you'll want to face it before entering the Valley of Ecstasy or you'll miss out on this fight altogether.\n\n* **Rewards:** Cold Iron Leaves x2, 1847 Experience, 1176 Will (First Encounter), Apramana Bat Spirit (Second Encounter)\n\n## Where to Find the Apramana Bat\n\nA much larger gold variant of the Apramana Bats you can encounter elsewhere in Chapter 3, the Apramana Bat boss can be found once you leave the Turtle Island. From the North Shore of Bitter Lake, head right from the Shrine and along the coast until you come upon the skeletal remains of the Snake General. Once you arrive where his skull is located, the giant bat will ambush you.\n\n### Apramana Bat Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nOnce you've gotten it on the ground for an extended period to dish out damage, be mindful not to get overconfident. If you see it hunch over and turn completely gold, it will use its own rock solid deflection to make your attack bounce off.\n\nListen for the sound cue of your attack being deflected, and it will quickly rise up and extend a bladed wing up in the air before slamming it down on you. You can turn the tables with your own deflection (though it will send you sliding back), or dodge to the side and bash it with a Spirit Attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Zhu Bajie can be a big boon for this fight, as the bat will largely focus on you with its ranged flying attacks, and as it drops to the ground between attacks, the little pig guy will be right there waiting for score some free hits. Don't be afraid to fall back either and wait for him to heal you as needed, but otherwise you can bait out several of the Apramana Bats ranged attacks without having to worry too much about closing the distance until the opportunity presents itself, allowing your sidekick to chip away in the meantime.\n\nOnce defeated, you'll gain a journal entry, experience, and some materials for your victory, but the Apramana Bat itself will retreat, and fly off into the distance. This won't be the last you see of it...\n\nIn fact the Apramana Bat will appear again as you first enter the Valley of Ecstasy, flying high toward the New Thunderclap Temple.\n\nYou'll only see it again during the final battle with Yellowbrow in the temple. In a cutscene during the fight, Yellowbrow will toss you into the air, where the Apramana Bat will be waiting. However, it appears that the Destined One will automatically absorb the bat and use it to attack Yellowbrow.\n\nAfter the fight is over and you complete Chapter 3, you'll find that the Apramana Bat Spirit has been automatically entered into your inventory!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
