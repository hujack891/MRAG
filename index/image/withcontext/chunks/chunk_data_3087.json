Located at the center of the large black tornado in the Yellow Wind Formation in the center of the region, you'll need two Key Items to open a path to him.\n\n* **Rewards:** Samahdi Wind Agate, Cold Iron Leaves x2, Refined Iron Sand x1, Silk x5, Yaoguai Core x2, Mind Core x1, 2583 Experience, 1944 Will\n\n\nWith both pieces, you can open the door where you defeated the King of Flowing Sands, or open up the temple cellar in the Crouching Tiger Temple, or slide down past the Rock Crash Platform to the Windseal Gate.\n\n## Yellow Wind Sage Boss Fight and Guide\nNote - if you have the Wind Tamer, you can use it now to fully negate the sandstorm and stop it from happening, which will also force him out of many of the attacks he uses in this phase. As an added bonus, using the Wind Tamer will also stun him for an extended period, so make use of it by hitting him with your biggest charged heavy strikes!\n\nIf you don’t have the Wind Tamer, he’ll vanish into the sandstorm, and instead send out giant sand copies of himself to strike at you in different directions. Since they are copies, you can’t really counter attack them, and they’ll fade away right after attacking:\"\n            - Following Text: \"* One version will run up to you with its free hand glowing and swing it upwards to trigger a line of sand spears to explode up from the ground.
