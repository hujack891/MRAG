Her main methods of attack are kick-based, and they hit extremely hard. Thankfully, most of her attacks can be avoided with well-timed Perfect Dodges. Be careful when you knock Poisestone down that she is actually dead. Some rock enemies have a habit of passing out for a bit before getting back up to continue fighting.\n\n## Poisestone Spirit\"\n            - Following Text: \"* **Strike at Heart**\n* Equipped Effect: Moderately increases the Damage of Jump Light Attacks and reduces the Stamina cost of Sprinting.\n\nPoisestone's Spirit is quite a good one for multiple reasons. For one, it is a double-pronged attack that deals damage both with an initial kick to the chest as well as inflicting area damage when you land. The equipped effect is also excellent and both increases Light Attack damage while reducing Sprinting Stamina cost. Even when you're not actively using the Poisestone's skill, you are still getting those two equip buffs which can make a big difference in both combat and exploration.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
