Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the grove and learning how to cultivate Spirits, accessing a secret realm, as well as how to defeat the many bosses of this area that include Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, Guangmou, and the Whiteclad Noble.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Back Hills**\n* **Snake Trail**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Guangmo\n* **Marsh of the White Mist**\n- Boss FIght - Whiteclad Noble\n\n\nTo advance, keep heading up the stairway to cross the high bridge over the falls, where you’ll soon see the golden trail of a nearby shrine beckoning you left. Before making that turn, be sure to look to the right to find a small wooden gazebo with a small table, and open the small gold box on top to find a variety of medicines, including 2 **Tiger Subduing Pellets** , 1 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 1 **Amplification Pellet**.\n\n\nAnother good strategy to note is that if you’re in danger of getting close to becoming poisoned, using the Red Tides spell can help you transform out of danger. Any status effects suffered while transformed as Guangzhi will be removed when you regain your regular health bar. As an added bonus, Guangmou will even comment on your transformation.\n\nOnce you’ve learned how to evade his projectiles, the rest of the fight will just boil down to chasing him down and stunning him however you can with Immobilize, your Spirit Attack, and other heavy hits. When he falls, you’ll gain Guangmou’s Spirit to add to your collection, allowing you to summon venomous snakes of your own!\n\n\nWhen you’re ready to move on, make sure you’re fully healed up from dealing with that snake, as the end of this downward path leads to the titular marsh where a very strong boss waits to block your path.\n\n## Boss Fight - Whiteclad Noble\n\nMany times he employs either the first half or the entire combo attack, he’ll wait a moment before readying his next move. Watch for him to pull his spear back as he twists his body, as after a brief delay he will swing his spear around in a circle spin that’s tough to dodge, as it creates a delayed watery shockwave circle further out. Because of this, you’ll want to dodge toward him, and not retreat into the shockwave.\"\n            - Following Text: \"At range, he may do a backwards twirl, but this is only to prepare a very fast spear throw in your direction. Dodge to the side and prepare for him to follow his spear, grabbing onto the embedded weapon and spin around it to launch himself at you once more feet first, and then one final lunge with his spear for a third and final strike.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
