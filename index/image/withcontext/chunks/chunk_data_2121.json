The leader of a gang of insect guai that have taken over Purple Cloud Mountain, he can only be reached by entering a secret area.\n\n* Rewards: Sky-Piercing Horn, Deathstinger (Material), Stained Jade Gourd, Fine Gold Thread, Mind Core, 3410 Experience, 2595 Will\n\n\nThe Scorpionlord is an optional Yaoguai King, and potentially one of the toughest bosses you'll face in Chapter 4, even though he is not required to complete the Secret Area of Purple Cloud Mountain. However, if you do not defeat him before defeating the actual final boss of this region, he may not be available afterwards.\n\nTo reach Purple Cloud Mountain, you will have to defeat the Venom Daoist twice - both in the Upper Webbed Hollow, and in a side path outside the Temple of Yellow Flowers main area. This will unlock a mural allowing you to travel to this new area.\n\nOnce you reach the first main shrine at the Valley of Blooms, keep to the right to find a pathway leading to the Bounds of Deity's Abode Shrine, and stairs up to where the Scorpionlord lounges drinking on top of a building.\n\nTo goad him into fighting, simply break any of the pots in the area around him.\n\n## The Scorpionlord Boss Fight and Guide\n\nHe'll then launch into a series of quick and relentless tail swipes, starting with an upward slash, a downward slam, followed by a quick low sweep, and then a final extremely damaging thrust from behind his back. The timing of these strikes can be challenging to time correctly, and he'll punctuate three of the four strikes as he shouts \"Taste my... deathsting!\" Due to how powerful this move is, you'll need to practice timing your dodges perfectly to avoid getting hit and poisoned by his strikes.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once you've dealt a fair amount of damage, he can also drive his tail deep into the ground. Poison will start welling up in multiple spots all around you, and explode with small geysers after a moment. The area is quite large, and you may want to quickly swap to the Pillar Stance to avoid the explosions and retaliate quickly with a charged hit.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
