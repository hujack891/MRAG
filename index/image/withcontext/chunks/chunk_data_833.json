You can reach this boss by making your way through the Pagoda Realm and through the Temple of Warding and out the back to a large slope you can slide down onto Turtle Island.\n\n### Kang-Jin Star Boss Fight and Guide\n\nAt around half health, she'll start to get madder, and teleport high up to summon several groups of electrical bolts that will fly out in small clusters to track you down. You can't deflect them with your staff, so either use Cloud Step or stick to dodging.\n\nAfter this, she'll trigger a thunderstorm that darkens the arena, filling you the area with static electricity and most likely giving you the Shocked status effect. Take a moment to use a Shock-Quelling medicine.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Right after she inflicts you with Shock, she'll trigger an even bigger lightning storm to try and maximize her damage against you, which is another good time to make yourself scarce with Cloud Step, and otherwise keep running around to avoid the attacks.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
