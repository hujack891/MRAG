Hiding across several rope bridges outside the middle of the Webbed Hollow, this boss can't be activated until you obtain a Key Item in the previous chapter. Yellow Loong is the final of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n\n* Rewards: Golden Lining Transformation Spell, Sea-Supporting Tendon, Golden Carp Curio, Kun Steel, Loong Pearl, Mind Core, 6998 Experience, 5049 Will\n\n\nYou can enter the crack in the wall, and on the other side you’ll find a chest containing the Loong Scales. With this item, you’ll be able to unlock the boss.\n\n## Yellow Loong Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe other move is even more aggravating, as he can Cloud Step without warning even when standing around between moves if you try to attack, and can completely waste a fully charged strike. He'll dash backward while intangible, then quickly race forward to strike -- though you can turn that tables by deflecting his counter-attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Because of this, its often better to rely on building your focus with light attack combos, and only unleash heavy attacks after deflecting with Rock Solid for an instant hit that he won't have time to dodge. Getting your meter filled to the fourth focus point also ensures you'll be dealing the best possible damage that will knock him down every time.\n\nExpect this fight to take a lot of attempts as you learn the different ways he can string his combos together, when the best times are to catch him off guard, and - most importantly - practice dodging his lightning dive-bomb attacks that can kill your attempt in an instant. Try to get rid of the Shocked status effect any time you get inflicted, so long as you don't leave yourself open while doing so.\n\nOnce Yellow Loong is finally revealed, his fate will be sealed, as the Ancient Master whose garment he was hiding in will convince the ancient dragon to relinquish his power, channeling it into his polearm, which you can grab to obtain the Golden Lining Transformation Spell to become a Loong yourself! You'll also finally get the last ingredient types to craft the ultimate Loong Staff Weapon!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
