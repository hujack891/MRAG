Inside is an Abomination in the corner, as well as an empowered Enslaved Yaksha you can defeat to gain the Enslaved Yaksha Spirit. Defeat them both and help yourself to a **Treasure Chest** in the corner full of materials.\n\n\nThe cell beyond will require you to have beaten Captain Lotus-Vision to unlock, and holds a **Treasure Chest** with materials in addition to the Wisp on the ledge, guarded by another Red-Haired Yaksha.\n\n\nFinally, wait until the distressing chants begin and curse you one last time, and a final Lantern Sentry on this level will appear nearby. If you defeat him (and have defeated all the other Lantern Sentries in the Pagoda Realm), he'll drop the **Auspicious Lantern Curio** , which allows you to trigger the \"chant-beguiling\" effect of this prison at will when using Cloud Step.\n\n\nAs you head back to the shrine before the next big boss fight, now is a good time to take stock on what you've gained thus far.\n\n* Be sure to spend all your will by cultivating chosen spirits, and crafting a strong weapon, either the Loongwreathe Staff if you've defeated both the Red Loong and Black Loong in Chapter 1 and 2, or the Kang-Jin Staff which can deal electric damage if you have the right skils unlocked for Punishing Downpour.\n* Travel back to the Shen Monkey and upgrade your Gourd's healing capabilities, and stock up on whatever new items he's selling.\n* Make sure to keep Cloud Step equipped over Rock Solid, as it'll be equally worthwhile for this boss as it was for the last.\n\nWhen you're ready, it's time to stop that awful chanting once and for all by heading into the pagoda itself.\n\n\nLike Captain Lotus-Vision, you'll also get The Spirit of Captain Wise-Voice that can't be cultivated. You can now step out through the opposite opening to exit this pagoda, and you can check the rim of the cliff to the left to find a **Treasure Chest** with materials inside.\n\n\nJust past him, you'll find a long stone staircase to ascend and chase the golden trail of a nearby Shrine. Grab the green Wisp as you make the climb, and at the end you'll find the next checkpoint.\n\n## Snow-Veiled Trail\n\nWhen the path turns into a large valley, another Falcon Guai will appear, only this one is empowered by the Spirit within. You'll need to attack cautiously against this stronger foe, using Spirit attacks to stagger him, and Cloud Step to sidestep his gusts to flank him from the sides. Defeat him, and you'll gain the Falcon Hermit Spirit.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Head through the rest of the valley and deal with a Yaksha Patroller, which will lead to another rope bridge leading to a higher ledge.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.

Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
