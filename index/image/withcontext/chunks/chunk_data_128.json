Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine.\n\nBe sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.\n\nMount Huaguo Shrine Shop\n| Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop              | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop            | Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Body-Cooling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |                                |\n| Mind Core (x6) - 3000 Will          | Find Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will     | Celestial Ribbon (x1) - 9000 Will   | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Wil |\n\n## Verdant Path\n\nContinue straight up from the Keeper's Shrine and into the clearing that's adorned by chains. Make your way into the center of the clearing, where Bajie will exclaim it's a dead end. However, you'll soon be joined by the Supreme Celestial Inspector. If you found all of the Purple Talismans in Chapter 4, then this will be a familiar face to you.\n\n\nWhen his health is down to the last third, he will cover the arena with a red haze, reducing the size of the arena that you'll fight the creature in. He will also begin to use two swords instead of one. This is when you want to throw out the Plantain Fan. It will clear the red haze immediately and continuously stun him, giving you more time to whittle down his health.\n\nAfter defeating the Supreme Inspector, he'll pick you up and fly off with you. This will lead to The Destined One learning to use Wukong's Somersault Cloud. To activate it, **press Down on the D-Pad or G if using a keyboard**.\n\nWhen the cutscene is over, you'll be at the edge of the cliff, so hop on to Somersault Cloud to get started exploring the area.\n\n\nFrom the edge of the cliff, look straight down to see a pool of water. Go down and to the center of this water to fight our first optional boss, Jiao-Loong of Waves.\n\n\nOn the opposite side of the water, there's a clearing, with what appears to be a big rock sitting by the edge of it. This is actually one of the Poison Chiefs in the area, so fly over to it to tackle your next miniboss.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 1\n\nJust like stone bosses and the flint bosses from Chapter 5, most of the attacks from the Poison Chief will be charges and slams. It will try to use the weight of its body to attack while delivering smatterings of poison around the area.\n\nIts charges can be avoided, by dashing out of the way just before it reaches you. A similar approach can be applied to dealing with its lunges and punches.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The biggest issue is the poison attacks, and it's essential to interrupt them as often as you can. The Plantain Fan can prove invaluable here once again, especially if you deploy it just before a poison attack. It will push the Poison Chief back and allow you to follow up with attacks. Use Immobilize when the Plantain Fan has stopped working, to keep it in place and deplete its health as quickly as possible.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
