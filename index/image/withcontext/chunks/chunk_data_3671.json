This character will ask you to complete a side quest for him that will unlock Chapter 2’s Secret Area: The Kingdom of Sahali.\n\n\nIn this large open field, you’ll find a friendly boar-like Guai resting on a rock. He’s apparently extremely inebriated, and needs you to help him find something to sober him up. He’ll mention “**Windrest** ” if you talk to him again, providing a clue to where you can find such an ingredient.\n\n## Where to Get the Sobering Stone\"\n            - Following Text: \"There are two ways to get the item required, one of which will cost you, and the other through exploring. If you complete the **Man-in-Stone’s questline**, you’ll find that the **Man-in-Stone** sells a **Sobering Stone** if you don’t want to explore. Since it costs a hefty 6,480 Will, you’re better off finding one yourself.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
