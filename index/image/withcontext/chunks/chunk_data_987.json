Not to be confused with his brother, the Tiger Vanguard of the Crouching Tiger Temple, you can only reach this boss by following the trail of a ghostly boy using the Old Rattle-Drum Key Item.\n\n* Rewards: Mad Tiger Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Yaoguai Core x1, Stone Spirit x1, 1102 Experience, 1023 Will, Plaguebane Gourd (in chest)\n\n\nUsing the Rattle-Drum here one final time will cause the spirit of the boy to appear before you, and invite you to hop down the well to meet a “friend”. Unfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there.\n\n## Mad Tiger Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe ostracized brother of the Tiger Vanguard, the Mad Tiger may not have his sword, but he’s a violent powerhouse of a boss that’s even more dangerous and possibly more difficult than the other two Tiger bosses. As such, you’ll want to equip yourself with the best possible gear in Chapter 2 — you may even want to complete the chapter and return back from Chapter 3 if you find yourself unable to make a dent in this boss. Make sure you’re stocked up on medicines to help bolster your damage output and damage reduction.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The Mad Tiger will begin the fight with a fast leap, landing with a slashing single blow you’ll need to dodge and then retaliate.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
