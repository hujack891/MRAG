Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration.\n\n## Valley Entrance\n\nUltimately, you're going to go left to continue on the main path (and you may start to hear characters talk as you approach this pillar), but for now, you'll want to detour and explore the area to the right.\n\nThe first thing you'll see as you go to the right is the Flamlings that sit in the lava. These will spit fire at you, so it's best to deal with them to remove the ranged attacks while you explore.\n\n\nDrop down here, and head right first to collect the Fire Date from the tree. Then go in the opposite direction toward the lava streaming from the ceiling. This is where you can find one of the optional bosses in Chapter 5, the Flint Chief.\n\n\nNow turn back the other way and continue up the valley. At the top of the path, you'll come to another archway and the start of Rakshasa Palace.\n\nAs soon as you pass through the archway, the next boss battle will begin and you'll discover who was responsible for the voices you heard earlier.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Cloudy Mist, Misty Cloud\n\nIt will mainly shoot lasers from the smaller face on its chest and use projectiles. The way that these attacks appear can vary wildly from one laser at a time, to multiple in a criss-cross pattern. As for the projectiles, you'll see either a few larger balls of mist or multiple tiny ones sent your way.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The lasers can be avoided by dodging or jumping over them, and the projectiles can be outrun or you can dodge to stop them hitting you. When there are numerous, we'd recommend outrunning them, and when there are just a few, dodge out of the way. During this fight, you want to stay as close to Cloudy Mist as possible, to remove the advantage of his long-range attacks.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
