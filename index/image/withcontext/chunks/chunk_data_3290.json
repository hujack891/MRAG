Below you'll find a guide to accessing the mountain by defeating the Venom Daoist, and how to complete Hong Yi the Snake Guai's quest to defeat the Daoist Mi and Duskveil, as well as the formidable Scorpionlord.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* How to Access Purple Cloud Mountain\n* **Valley of Blooms**\n* **Bounds of Deity's Abode**\n- Yaoguai King - The Scorpionlord\n* **Petalfall Hamlet**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Daoist Mi\n* **Cloudnest Peak**\n- Yaoguai King - The Duskveil\n\nThis Chapter 4 Secret can only be accessed by finding and defeating the Venom Daoist in two different locations, and will transport you to a different location to fight a secret Yaoguai King and repair a Vessel that is instrumental in defeating the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master.\n\n\nWhen the Venom Daoist is finally defeated, he'll point to a mural that will appear on a nearby wall, sending you to Purple Cloud Mountain.\n\n\nThe start of this region is a linear mountain path lined with a few materials to harvest, and up ahead you'll hear the sounds of someone crying. The \"someone\" is actually a snake guai (named Hong Yi). The widower was forced out of her mountaintop village by insect guais led by the Scorpionlord, rendering her unable to retrieve her late husband's keepsakes.\n\nShe'll warn you of the dangerous venom of the enemies ahead, and you can even find a **Treasure Chest** near her that holds 3 Antimiasma Powder that will be incredibly useful when taking on the Scorpionlord.\n\nHead across the bridge to the right and grab a green Wisp, and go through the archway into the next larger area.\n\n## Valley of Blooms\n\nHead along the path to the right to reach the Valley of Blooms Shrine. As with previous Secret Areas, this one has its own separate shop where you can purchase things not found in the rest of the Webbed Hollow, which can help you toward crafting better weapons and armor:\n\nPurple Cloud Mountain Shrine Shop\n| Purple Cloud Mountain Shrine Shop      | Purple Cloud Mountain Shrine Shop | Purple Cloud Mountain Shrine Shop  | Purple Cloud Mountain Shrine Shop   |\n| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |\n| Tiger Subduing Pellets (x3) - 360 Will | Antimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will |                                    |                                     |\n| Cold Iron Leaves (x2) - 900 Will       | Fine Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will | Refined Iron Sand (x4) - 1200 Will | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Will     |\n| Gentian (x5) - 90 Will                 | Tree Pearl (x3) - 180 Will        | Jade Lotus (x3) - 90 Will          | Snake-Head Mushroom (x3) - 120 Will |\"\n            - Following Text: \"The area before you is larger than you might expect, and a little confusing to navigate at first.
