This character will ask you to retrieve an item from a nearby cave, and if defeated in a fight, will grant you a Transformation Spell, and then begin to sell you items later on.\n\n## Where to Find the Man-in-Stone\n\nAt the end of the cave path, you’ll find the object of the Man-in-Stone’s quest - an even larger statue embedded with shining blue crystals. Don’t get too enraptured that you miss a Poisestone along the walls trying to ambush you, though.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Miniboss - Mother of Stone\n\nOnce you’ve defeated two waves of single Palestones each, the third wave will consist of two Palestones at the same time. This can be a huge problem fast if they gang up on you with alternating attacks. Deflecting their ranged quartz missiles isn’t too bad… until you’re also dealing with one trying to body slam you.\n\nThis is the time to use everything in your arsenal to stay alive. Make sure you’re using your Spirit attacks to focus fire a target, unleash any stored Focus Points, and use Immobilize or Cloud Step to stay out of danger.\"\n            - Following Text: \"There’s one last wave of two after this, for a total of six Palestones for the whole fight. Again, don’t hold back, and use your Transformation Spell to power down at least one of the enemies as quickly as possible so you aren’t overwhelmed. Don’t be afraid to back well off and heal to stay out of range of their projectiles.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
