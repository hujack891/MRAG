Even when she returns to a \"resting\" state, she'll usually be off the ground, and will regularly pull back her head out of reach. Expect her to deal a lot of shock damage, so stock up on shock-quelling medicine or you'll be taking double damage for a lot of this fight.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Kang-Jin Loong will often begin the fight by racing right at you headfirst, so be ready to dodge to the side. If you can time things right, Immobilize can pin her in place long enough to get some hits in.\n\nGet your hits in on her face when she returns to float in front of you, and be ready for the boss to whip around and prepare new attacks.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
