This agile fighter will use flames and duplicates to try and overwhelm you during this heated altercation at the end of the chapter.\n\n\nRed Boy can be found toward the end of Chapter 5, by following the main path. Head up the slope to see Pingping speak to her father. The Bull King isn't best pleased with The Destined One, but also has an issue with Pingping and her deception. It turns out that Pingping is actually the Red Boy, and he will transform before your eyes, ready for a battle.\n\n## Red Boy Boss Fight and Guide\n\nWhen his health reaches the halfway point, he'll launch himself up in the air. Shortly after, he'll create duplicates of himself that will appear all around him. These will launch themselves at you with their spears, resulting in an explosion. It'll start with one duplicate launching themselves at you, then two, and finally, a set of three will attack.\n\nThe best way to approach this is to stay locked on the Red Boy, but move as far back in the area as you can. If you need to, use any rocks nearby that haven't been destroyed. You can then dodge in any direction to evade the attacks and do a quick double tap of dodge when you have multiple duplicates coming at you. If you're finding it difficult to dodge the attacks, Cloudstep can help you direct some of the attention away from yourself.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once the duplicates are gone, he will immediately follow with a strong attack. Most of his attacks can actually be interrupted by your own heavy attack, so try to build focus with cautious half-combos or equip items that will let you gain it quickly. Performing heavy attacks will stagger him and stop him from going into certain moves entirely if timed right.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
