Below, you'll find a Walkthrough for the first major area of The Flaming Mountains called Woods of Ember, as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* ** **Ashen Pass I\n- Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Brown-Iron Cart\n* **Camp of Seasons**\n* **Height of Ember**\n- Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones\n- Yoaguai Chief - Gray-Bronze Cart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind\n* **Ashen Pass II**\n\n##  Ashen Pass I\n\nBefore you go over to them, harvest the **Fire Bellflower** by the Buddha statue on the right. Then, go straight up and into the midst of the fighting, to find the Pale-Axe Stalwart taking on nearby Revenants. Alongside the fighting, the area is also being pelted with firebombs so having the Fireproof Mantle Vessel here can help you focus more on the fighting and less on the fire attacks.\n\n### Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\n\nWhen you've knocked his health bar almost all the way down, he will kneel. To make the area safer, clear out the rest of the fighting Yaoguais, then approach the Pale-Axe Stalwart, who will now become an NPC with his own side quest for you to complete.\n\nSpeak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart, who will be pleased you've not been harmed. Keep prompting him to talk so you exhaust all of his dialogue. Eventually, he'll tell you about the five element carts and ask you to destroy them.\n\nHe'll also hint that the coffin carts are guarding more than just the passes across the mountains, but we'll revisit that once the side quest is concluded.\"\n            - Following Text: \"When his dialogue begins to repeat, resume your exploration of the area. First, go over to where there are four chests by the wall (opposite where you first entered the area). Two of the chests are already open, but there are two more to loot. Inside these, you'll find Cold Iron Leaves, Will, a Mind Core, and a Gold Tree Core.\n\nNow facing away from the chests, go right and up the stairs to begin your ascent of the mountain.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1. Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n            2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n            3. Incorporate any relevant metadata (e.g., section or document titles) to improve coherence, **but do not assume any domain-specific knowledge** unless explicitly stated.\n            4. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
