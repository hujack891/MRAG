Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nThe easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step. Cast it near the start of the rope bridge, and then sprint all the way to the other end, and don't try to staff spin if any arrows come your way, or you're likely to walk off the side by accident.\n\n## Relief of the Fallen Loong\n\nAfter sneaking across the bridge (be sure to go back and grab the green Wisp only after you've taken out the archer), you'll find another exit from the Hollow leading to a lush cliffside path.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The area is chock-full of various plants to harvest, but you'll also find a bunch of Beetle Captains who appear to be doing the same. Since many of them have their backs turned as they scavenge, be sure to sneak up and charge up your focus points to deliver a big heavy attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.

Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.\n\n\n\n            Output Format:\n            Preceding Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the preceding text that gives context to the image.\n            Image Summary:\n            Provide a summary of the image, describing its purpose and content based on the context.\n            Following Text Summary:\n            Provide a concise summary of the following text that elaborates on the information related to the image.",
