An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n\nNow it’s time to finally open that door the Rat Captains were guarding. In the next scene, you’ll spot the next major boss fight: a tiny Rat King and his oversized son.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n\nThe easiest way to get the King to come down again is to simply lure the Second Prince over to one of the pillars. Let him strike at you wildly, and he’ll destroy the pillar and send the King toppling down to be hit. He doesn’t have much health, and has a hard time getting away, especially if you catch him some distance away from his son who can sometimes take his time closing the distance.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If you do want to do defeat the King but are worried about incurring the Prince’s wrath, a good idea is to attack the King whenever he’s exposed, but then focus your attention on taking the Prince’s health down to a manageable level so that when you defeat the King, the Prince can’t last long.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
