As an optional foe, you can seek out this enemy to gain their Spirit power by defeating them inside the Sandgate Village.\n\n* Rewards: Earth Wolf Spirit\n\n\nTake the path to the right of the sealed gate, and fight past two Rat Captains while keeping the village shacks on your left. As you circle the area, you can find a pathway leading to an archway guarded by a Rat Archer and Rat Governor, and you'll find the boss inside.\n\n## Earth Wolf Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nThough it can often rise up on its hind legs to slash at you with its front claws, certain times its wild swings will make it crash forward to land belly up. After a moment it will thrash around and try to damage you if close, but with an exposed unarmored part of its body, you can try freezing it in place and expending a charged attack - preferably with the Smash or Pillar Style to slam down on its ribs for extra damage.\n\nYou can also get an opportune strike after dodging its grab by using that moment to hit it hard with a Spirit attack from the Wandering Wight, and big enough hits can cause it to fall on its belly as well.\"\n            - Following Text: \"With enough damage dealt, the Earth Wolf will fall, revealing its Spirit to be claimed by you. You can look around the arena to harvest some Jade Lotus in the pond, or check the back of the houses to find other materials like Aged Ginseng.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
