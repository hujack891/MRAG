Just in case you've ended up on this page by accident, now is your warning and your chance to click away!\n\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong begins with Wukong fighting Erlang, The Sacred Divinity, and the Heavenly Kings. Despite putting up a good fight, Erlang and the kings are too strong, and Wukong runs off to the woods.\n\nErlang manages to catch up to Wukong and causes him to fall. And so, at the top of a mountain, Sun Wukong's story comes to an end and he's shown trapped inside of a rock.\n\nWe cut to The Old Monkey teaching a group about the tales of Sun Wukong, and he mentions the six relics where Wukong split himself. There is just one monkey who can venture through the lands to try and collect each of the Six Senses of the Great Sage, known as The Destined One.\n\n\nAs The Old Monkey collects the golden crown from the water, he places it on top of The Destined One's head. Unfortunately, this does nothing but place The Destined One inside the same rock that Wukong laid waiting.\n\n## Ending 2 - The (True) Secret Ending\n\nTo reveal the secret and true ending of the game, you'll need to travel to The Great Pagoda in Chapter 3 and unlock Mount Mei. You can find out more about how to unlock Mount Mei and the secret ending here.\n\nThis will see you face off against Erlang, The Sacred Divinity, The Four Heavenly Kings, and Erlang Shen. After winning the battle against them, you'll need to return to fight the Stone Monkey and The Great Sage's Broken Shell.\n\nYou'll see the exact same cutscene for this ending, where Wukong falls to his knees and loses the Six Senses from his body only for The Destined One to absorb them.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The difference with this ending, however, is that when the gold crown drops into the water, and The Old Monkey picks it up and places it on The Destined One's head, there will be a flash where The Destined One opens his eyes.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
