Located near the end of the Fright Cliff area, imposing Rock Guai sports a formidable defense and exploding attacks.\n\n* **Rewards:** Sterness of Stone, Mind Core x1, Yaoguai Core x2, 1652 Experience, 1366 Will\n\n\nLook for an archway on the left wall in this area to find this boss arena.\n\n## Stone Vanguard Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe Stone Vanguard is one of two bosses you must defeat to advance to the end of Chapter 2, and defeating it is no easy task. As a hulking monster of rock, the Stone Vanguard employs lots of tremor attacks and huge shockwaves whenever it slams its giant front arms down — which is most of the time. Cloud Step can be very useful for getting out of the way of incoming leaps, and then blindsiding it from the side to stagger it off of its current attack.\n\n### Secret - Get Help from the Shigandang\n\nIt’s these major slamming attacks you’ll need to be extra careful, and watch closely for when its front arms begin to glow. These types of attacks mean his arms will soon have a delayed detonation, and are designed to bait you into countering early and getting caught in the blast. Instead, hang back and use the Thrust Stance if possible to unleash a charged hit from a safe distance to the side, as the detonation will also trigger rocks to rip upwards in front of him.\"\n            - Following Text: \"While the explosion and rocky spikes can be dodged with good timing — it’s also possible to negate the effect by using your charged Pillar Stance. When done at a reasonable distance, you’ll simply ignore the tremor below you, and can follow up with a charged strike that often staggers the monster. However, if you try to create a pillar too close to his hands, the explosion can send you tumbling, though it usually absorbs the damage.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
