Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n- Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\n\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\n\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n\n\nInside the side room, there's another large tree that a Supporter Monk is facing, but a Wolf Guardian will try to ambush you as you approach him. You can also find a Ginsengling around the tree roots by trying to harvest some Aged Ginseng.\n\nCarefully head through the open doorway into the side plaza, and look for a small alcove on the left for a green Wisp to absorb. However, once you begin to explore this area, a Yaoguai Chief will emerge from a nearby altar.\n\n\nThe large gateway at the end of this path is guarded by three Overseeing Monks, one apart from the others, but all can be lured away independently due to their short-range senses.\n\n\nAfter defeating them, you can spot a lone monk standing inside. This is the target of the Snow Fox's quest for revenge, and you can now use the Snow Fox Brush in your inventory to transform into The Fox, and step inside to trigger a cutscene (if you enter first you can speak to him, but transforming near the monk will instantly trigger the fight without a scene).\n\n\nOnce you've claimed the pill, hop up the other side of the frozen river to fight the Clay Vajra. Follow the path around the frozen river past where several Censor Holders are praying before a Dual-Blade Monk, and you'll find a **Treasure Chest** in front of a large stone monument near where the frozen river leads to the bridge you ran across earlier.\n\nNow you can return back to the Main Plaza, and this time head up past where you defeated the other Clay Vajra for its Spirit, and enter the last part of the temple.\n\n\nBefore leaving his boss room, be sure to look where he was initially standing to find the last **Meditation Point** in Chapter 3, and gain your free Skill Point.\n\n\nNow that you've finished exploring all that Chapter 3 has to offer you currently, only the final boss awaits, and it's a bit of a gauntlet.\n\nAfter resting at the Mahavira Hall Shrine at the top of the stairs, be sure to take assessment of your gear. Cultivate your best Spirits, make sure you have a lot of pills on hand an craft a bunch of extra Shock-Quelling Powder (you're going to need it).\n\nYou should also have any anti-shock gear/curios/soaks on hand as well, along with whatever else can keep you alive for awhile. This final encounter is spread out into three distinct fights, and while you'll be able to respawn and pick up where you left off for the first two sections from the Shrine, the final section won't take you back to the Shrine.\n\nWhen you're ready to take on the lord of New Thunderclap Temple, head through the door.\n\n\nWhen you awaken, you'll finally find out what happened to your friend Zhu Bajie -- he's also been captured, and forced to fight in here against another familiar face: The Macaque Chief. It's time for the final round.\n\n\nKeep moving down until you reach the bottom shelf, and you'll find another pathway back up on the opposite side of Yellowbrow's little diorama. Once you clear a path to a large open arena, Yellowbrow himself will shrink down to meet you in combat for a final bout.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\n\nThis second fight is spaced into three phases, during which Yellowbrow will stop the fight momentarily to string you about like a rag doll. This means you can only take a third of his health bar off before he'll stop taking damage and stun you, which is worth noting so that you don't try and unleash a huge stored up attack when he's about to start a new phase.\n\nEven worse, when you take off the first third of his health, he'll stun you with electricity and then smack you around with his mace. This unavoidable cutscene actually takes off around 40% of your health, and is what we like to call a dick move.\n\nHe'll usually begin the next phase of the fight be performing another of his electrical cleaving attacks to tear another part of the ground, and with your low health, you'll need to quickly heal up or evade or risk an instant death!\"\n            - Following Text: \"In his second phase, he'll often throw in more attacks into the mix, including a deadly binding spell that creates a ring of electricity around you. You'll be unable to escape this ring, and he will start tossing projectiles at you that you'll need to spin your staff to get rid of.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
