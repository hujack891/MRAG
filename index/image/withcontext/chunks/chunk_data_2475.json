The leader of the Spider Guai and master of The Webbed Hollow, the Violet Spider and her six daughters control this region, and their mother has particular plans for the pig known as Zhu Bajie.\n\n* Rewards: Spider Leg, Refined Iron Sand, 3410 Experience, 2608 Will\n\n\nThe Violet Spider is a required and non-missable boss in Chapter 4. She is the final boss of the Webbed Hollow Section, and must be defeated to progress to the next area. After you have reached the Lower Hollow and defeated Zhu Bajie to free him of his bewitching curse, he'll be abducted again.\n\nTo reach him (and the Violet Spider), you'll need to ascend the Purfiying Spring outside the Hut of Immortality, and follow the trail upwards to The Gathering Cave where the spider queen awaits you.\n\n## Violet Spider Boss Fight and Guide\n\nMuch like The Second Sister, this boss will take the form of a gigantic and fearsome spider, and uses attacks in a few similar ways. She can lash out with her appendages, which will subtly shift into long blades but also give you a clue as to where her main attacks will come from. As you might expect, you'll also have to deal with dodging both poison and webbing, making mobility key to your survival.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The Violet Spider will often begin the fight with a signature webbing attack, shooting out several strands in a large frontal arc that you'll need to dodge or you'll waste time getting stuck and having to free yourself while being unable to do much else. Even if you do dodge the initial blast, there will be a web coating on the ground where the attack land that will slow you considerably, and you'll want to move the fight away from such spots as much as possible.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
