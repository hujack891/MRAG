The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems.\n\n\nAs you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple. A long slope here will send you down to a large arena, and its here you'll have your second and final encounter with an old foe - the Venom Daoist.\n\n## Boss Fight - Venom Daoist (Second Encounter)\n\nMuch of the rest of this fight will revolve around avoiding his lengthy combo attacks and retaliating after his last hit, or quickly evading or deflecting his charging dash attacks to stop him in his tracks.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Once the Daoist is defeated for good, he'll impart a mysterious message, telling you to \"find the needle on Purple Cloud Mountain\". As he departs, he mural will form on the nearby wall, which you can now interact with to travel to **Chapter 4's Secret Area: Purple Cloud Mountain**. As with other Secret Areas, we recommend exploring it before you proceed to the final boss of this chapter, as it will be instrumental in helping to defeat the final boss of this area.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
