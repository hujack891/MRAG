Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration.\n\n## Valley Entrance\n\nUltimately, you're going to go left to continue on the main path (and you may start to hear characters talk as you approach this pillar), but for now, you'll want to detour and explore the area to the right.\n\nThe first thing you'll see as you go to the right is the Flamlings that sit in the lava. These will spit fire at you, so it's best to deal with them to remove the ranged attacks while you explore.\n\n\nDrop down here, and head right first to collect the Fire Date from the tree. Then go in the opposite direction toward the lava streaming from the ceiling. This is where you can find one of the optional bosses in Chapter 5, the Flint Chief.\n\n\nNow turn back the other way and continue up the valley. At the top of the path, you'll come to another archway and the start of Rakshasa Palace.\n\nAs soon as you pass through the archway, the next boss battle will begin and you'll discover who was responsible for the voices you heard earlier.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Cloudy Mist, Misty Cloud\n\nWhen this happens, you'll want to focus on dodging the fire attacks from Misty Cloud. These often happen with him dragging the flaming bundle along the floor, to try and create a ripple of flames to get you. Or slamming it down like a hammer. There will be times when he puts the bundle on his back, and he's slow with this move, so you've got plenty of time to attack.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The fight can feel quite fast-paced as they swap in and out to attack, so to put an end to their teamwork and slow things down, make use of spells like Immobilize. You should then aim to build as much Focus as possible and look for opportunities to perform heavy attacks. Both bosses can be staggered by this, giving you a chance to whittle down their health.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
