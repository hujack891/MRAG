The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems.\n\n\nAs you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple. A long slope here will send you down to a large arena, and its here you'll have your second and final encounter with an old foe - the Venom Daoist.\n\n\nBefore you do, you should also head through the nearby gateway to find a large field with a giant tree in the middle. Off on the right, you can find a wooden ledge overlooking the mountains with a **Treasure Chest** full of random materials and a Soul Remigration Pill.\n\n\nHead back to the altar, and pluck what should be the fourth and final talisman. Before you can celebrate this act, a large winged monster with a hand for a face will appear to aggressively punish you for this deed!\n\n\nNow that you've done all there is to do here, you can return to rest at the Shrine, and head toward the large field to finally catch up to the Violet Spider and her master, the Hundred-Eyed Daoist.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master\n\nOnce you've gotten him to around 25% of his health (right between the \"M\" and \"a\" in \"Master\", he'll clutch his head for an extended moment, and that's your cue to back off, as he'll no longer take damage for the moment. When he stabs the ground with his sword again, this time he'll channel a spell to bathe the arena in a golden dome. This is actually a great time to use any consumables you have on hand to buff yourself up, restore cooldowns or get back some Focus for the final phase.\n\nDespite this, the new phase won't actually begin until he grabs his sword again and charges at you, twisting his tail to slam down on you, and following up with two slow sword swings. Only then will a short cutscene play, and his true curse comes into play.\n\nAt this point, he'll no longer use his sword, focusing entirely on his electric fists and tail, and somehow dealing even more damage in the process. To make matters worse, he'll massively reduce your maximum stamina while in this golden dome.\"\n            - Following Text: \"To free yourself, you'll need to use the Weaver's Needle Vessel. It will take a moment to work so be prepared to dodge his next attack while the needle begins to shoot all around him.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
