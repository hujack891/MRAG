Located in the center of the Crouching Tiger Temple, this fearsome Tiger Guai is one of the hardest bosses to overcome in all of Chapter 2.\n\n* **Rewards:** Rock Solid Spell, Keeness of Tiger, Mind Core x1, Silk x3, 1652 Experience, 1362 Will\n\n\nYou can find him inside the Crouching Tiger Temple, which is located at the end of the Sandgate Village, taking a left after defeating the King of Flowing Sands and through a crack in the wall in the Valley of Despair.\n\n## Tiger Vanguard Boss Fight and Guide\n\nTry using your Thrust stance to ensure your heavy hits give you some breathing room at range, especially if you’re not confident he’s done attacking when you try to get big hits off. Similarly, you may want to rely on quick-hitting Spirits. Since you don’t get a different health bar like the Transformation Spells, there’s a good chance you may be stuck attacking right into a sword slash unless you time your Spirit attack well. In fact, a well-timed Earth Wolf Spirit can knock him right out of an attack and stagger him against a wall!\"\n            - Following Text: \"While you can use the new Azure Dust transformation, there’s a good chance he’ll keep staggering you before you can get many moves off, so it might be better to match his nimbleness with the Red Tides spell, and find a good time to dodge and unleash your ultimate attack.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
