An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n\nNow it’s time to finally open that door the Rat Captains were guarding. In the next scene, you’ll spot the next major boss fight: a tiny Rat King and his oversized son.\n\n\nAnother terrifying new move is for him to do a slow spin ending with a weapon toss right at you. He’ll quickly follow up with a leaping dive attack to reach his mace, and then pull it out of the ground and swing it forth, which should quell any thoughts of trying to attack at this point.\n\nIdeally, the lower you have his health before killing his father, the less time you’ll have to worry about this phase if you can rush him down. If you don’t kill his dad, he’ll scurry off as soon as the Second Prince falls. If not, you’ll be able to help yourself to the Second Prince’s Spirit, as well as a Pungent Flesh Chunk.\n\n## Valley of Despair\n\nHeading back down, you’ll be attacked from a ledge by a zombie-like Blazebone. These creatures fling bones down at you, but can’t do much else so simply evade or spin your staff before jumping up to kill it.\"\n            - Following Text: \"To the right, there’s a thin crevice filled with Fire Bellflowers to harvest. The crevice leads to a fallen rock forming a bridge to another Blazebone and Licorice, and a path leading onward.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
