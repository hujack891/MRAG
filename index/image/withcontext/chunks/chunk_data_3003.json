Clear out the foes, and then open it to find a **Copper Pill** Soak for your Gourd. This one in particular has an impressive effect to negate the cost of Rock Solid when used soon after using the gourd.\n\n## Windrest Bridge\n\nGoing up the main path to the back of the village, you’ll find a large gate with an arch where not one but three Rat Imperial Guard await you on the rooftops. To make matters worse, one of them is much stronger than the rest.\"\n            - Following Text: \"Consider using your stronger abilities on this group, like transforming into the Rock Guai to slam down on them, use your Pluck of Many if you have the mana, or Immobilize the weaker ones to focus them down before turning your attention to the one wreathed in blue flames. Defeating this stronger Rat will award you the Rat Imperial Guard Spirit, allowing you to perform some slick and quick moves with their fast transformation.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
