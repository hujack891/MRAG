It is one of the later game Transformations, found within the Flaming Mountains.\n\nWith the Dark Thunder Transformation, you are able to turn into a horse guai and be immune to Thunder Damage, inflicting Thunder Bane on the enemy with each attack. Any Focus built up before transformation can be converted for use afterward. Dark Thunder's moveset is:\n\n* **Light Attack: Lightning Lashes - Successively lash the enemy ahead, building up Focus**. This is a slow, weak light attack that is mostly used for building up Focus instead of dealing damage.\n* **Heavy Attack: Thunderbolt Sweep - Successively lash the enemies around, building up Focus**. This is a stronger attack, focused on dealing damage and building up Focus at the same time.\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Dark Thunder Location\n\nThe Dark Thunder Spell can be found after visiting the Horse Guai at every location he appears at in the game:\n\n* Black Wind Mountain \\- Bamboo Grove - Back Hills (inside a cave)\n* Yellow Wind Ridge \\- Sandgate Village - Village Entrance (tied to a post by the Earth Wolf boss)\n* The New West \\- New Thunderclap Temple - Temple Entrance (on the walkway in the back left of the temple grounds)\n* The Webbed Hollow \\- Webbed Hollow - Middle Hollow (in a cocoon in the area behind the Centipede Guai)\n* Flaming Mountains \\- Furnace Valley - Valley Entrance (found after killing Keeper of Flaming Mountains)\n\nUpon finding the Horse Guai for this final time, you can pull the chain in the mouth of the elemental cart next to them to obtain the Spell.\n\n### Horse Guai Black Wind Mountain Location\n\nFrom the start of the Bamboo Grove area, hug the left wall to find the cave with the Horse Guai.\"\n            - Following Text: \"\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
