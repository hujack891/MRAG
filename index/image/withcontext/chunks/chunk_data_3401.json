From the Shrine, head left while facing it to head along the lakeshore toward a lone shack by the water.\n\nSearch the shallows near this shack, and you'll find the old dragon wandering the waters, and will become hostile as you approach.\n\n### Chen Loong Boss Fight and Guide\n\nLike the other Loongs in The New West, Chen favors using lightning magic, and is a much more caster-oriented opponent compared to the others. You can prepare to mitigate his attacks by making sure you've crafted the Loongscale Armor Set, are stocked up on Shock-Quelling Powder, and apply the Soak to your Gourd that increases shock resistance.\n\nWhile he's nowhere as strong as the other dragons you've faced, you don't want to get to cocky, or you may find his electric attacks peeling off more of your health than you can restore, even with Zhu Bajie helping out.\"\n            - Following Text: \"The old dragon can be pretty agile too, leaping away to float in the air before casting a variety of electric attacks. One of these includes sending out a flurry of small electric orbs at you, though they can be deflected with a quick staff spin.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
