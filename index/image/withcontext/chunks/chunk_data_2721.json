Below you'll find a guide for the second middle area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find an optional encounter against the Elder Amourworm, and how to get past the Centipede Guai and Right Hand of Buddha to reach the Lower Hollow.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* ** **Verdure Bridge\n- Yaoguai Chief - Elder Amourworm\n* **Middle Hollow**\n* **Bonevault**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Centipede Guai\n* **Cliff of Oblivion**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Buddha's Right Hand\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nSince she seems like a trustworthy sort, head on inside, and you'll indeed find a literal trove of **Treasure Chests**!\n\nLooting them all, you'll be able to obtain a Xiang River Goddess Gourd, Enhanced Ginseng Pellet Formula, Gold Ridge Beast, and Purple-Veined Peach Pit Soak, plus several materials like Fine Gold Thread!\n\nThat's not all you can find, as there's an exit beyond leading to an outdoor cliff full of tiny cocoons, where the mother of all worms awaits you.\n\n\nOtherwise, you can also try keeping your distance and strafing during initial poison volleys, and then rush back in so you don't have to dance around poison when getting close.\n\nWhen the Amourworm is defeated, you'll gain a **Proto-Amourworm Key Item**. It may seem mysterious, but it does have a use. Bring it to Chen Loong at the Zodiac Village, and then return later to find the tiny Amourworm in a little basket outside his shack.\nYou'll need to feed the Proto-Amourworm three Rice Cocoons, which are randomly found by breaking apart small cocoons in the Webbed Hollow.\nOnce all three have been given, rest and return to find a Spirit has replaced the little worm, and you'll be able to absorb the **Elder Amourworm Spirit**!\n\nExit back to where you saw the mysterious women, and look to the right to find a mural with a green Wisp in front of it, and a pathway leading left. Take the path, and you'll find it leads down below the bridge you crossed earlier and over to the group of houses the other path led to.\n\n\nBefore you go, check the ledge to the left of the Shrine to find a **Treasure Chest** with some materials in it.\n\n\nSure enough, both this path and the one by the Middle Hollow Shrine lead up to a large recessed pit with a pile of skulls in the center. Once you've rested up, hop into the ominous pit to face your next big foe.\n\n\nThe best thing you can do is let them chase you by sprinting in the opposite direction, and then swerve to the side to make them all collide with each other and explode. Just be sure not to take too long, or the Centipede Guai will soon join the fray and ram you at much faster speeds.\n\nAside from that, there's not too many other moves the Centipede Guai is capable of, so focus on dodging its backward slam, and saving your deflections for when it tries to roll into you, and you'll have no problem finding plenty of time to get your big hits in.\n\nWhen the Centipede Guai falls, you'll be able to gain its Centipede Guai Spirit along with a Knot of Voidness and Gold Tree Core.\n\n## Cliff of Oblivion\n\nOnce you drop down a ledge, you can find a series of ledges along the cliff to the right with a green Wisp at the edge, and can even see an ominous bridge in the distance.\n\nHead back up the ledges to find an end to the tunnel where a grassy path is filled with cocoons all over the place.\"\n            - Following Text: \"One particularly large cocoon seems to be grunting, but it's not the return of the Venom Daoist. Instead, give it a wack to find your old pal the Horse Guai on the next part of his adventure!\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
