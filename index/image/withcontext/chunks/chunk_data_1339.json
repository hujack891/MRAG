This Yaoguai Chief is sent to block your progress into the Valley of Ecstasy, but you'll need to fight him twice to defeat this foe.\n\n* **Rewards:** Non-White Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Cold Iron Leaves x2, Random Materials, 1847 Experience, 1188 Will\n\n## Where to Find Non-White\n\nNon-White will attempt to ambush you early into your exploration for the entrance to the Valley of Ecstasy after you climb up from the Bitter Lake in The New West. Upon reaching the Mindfullness Cliff, you'll encounter him at the top platform in an outdoor area circling a large pit.\n\n### Non-White Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nFinally, he can also simply hang back and toss two poison-coated daggers your way in a quick throw, requiring good reaction time to evade.\n\nNote that if you try to press your attack while he's in an idle or defensive posture, he'll eventually deflect your combo with a louder block noise, and then retaliate -- but you can beat him at his own game by deflecting after his deflection.\"\n            - Following Text: \"If you've got a good idea of his attack patterns, using the Smash Stance's varied combo to \"see through\" his attacks can be extremely useful to power through his slices to hit him while he's unable to defend, and the follow-up heavystrike you can unlock usually can't be blocked by him either.\n\nThe good news is once you've taken out half of his real health bar (not his sword's defense bar), he'll break off the attack and retreat. The bad news is you haven't seen the last of him.\n\nContinue taking the path up the cliffs to reach a large open area with an archway at the far end leading to a huge valley, and on the right you'll find Non-White at a Meditation Spot waiting for round two.\"\n\n            Your task:\n            1.
