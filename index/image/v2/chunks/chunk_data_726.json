Stay mobile and away a good distance away, but not too far.\nAfter his screech, he'll crouch down and perform another bellow that sends a shockwave out, exploding all the crystals to deal additional frost damage to you. Since it's a bit harder to evade, you can get in a bit closer and prop yourself up on the Pillar Stance to evade the attack, then send your staff smashing down on him after the explosion.",
    "img_below_text": "While he doesn't have a ton of health or as much defense as other bosses, he can still get even more dangerous when low on health. His standard arm attack combo can be supercharged, causing icy explosions in a line from each of his swipes, and causing his slam to build up a giant frost area below him while also boxing you in a ring of icy crystals.\nSurviving this can be very tough as he'll try to keep you trapped and locked in his icy lair until you can't move, and then follow up with a loud screech to explode the icy and rocks around him, or perform another follow-up attack.",
