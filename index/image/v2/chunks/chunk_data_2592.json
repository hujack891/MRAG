While he doesn’t have many moves, they can often land extremely quickly, which means you’ll need to be ready to dodge at any moment.",
    "img_below_text": "His most standard attack includes a series of swipes with both arms that sends him forward, ending in a small leaping splash attack that allows him to reposition.

He can also use any of these swipes and slams independently as well as in a three-hit combo, so look for a follow-up attack before deciding to commit to countering with your own attacks.\n![Wukong Bamboo 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0c/Wukong_Bamboo_15.jpg)",
