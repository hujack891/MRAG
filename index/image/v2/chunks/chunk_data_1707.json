    "img_below_text": "Most of The Second Sister's main attack will come from her two front razor-sharp legs, and will be where you will want to focus the bulk (but not all) of your attention. She may often begin the fight by raising up one talon high up to the side, slice down with her two front legs in quick succession, and then rise up into the air to slam down after a delay.\nAnother move she can use at close range is to raise most of her body up on her back legs, and dance down upon you with her front talons to stab the ground multiple times in quick succession. Since it's hard to evade each blow individually, consider using the Thrust Stance to retreat and strike from a distance.",
