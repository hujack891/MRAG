While he doesn't deal elemental damage, he can be a hard target to pin down due to his ability to become non-corporeal, causing some of your attacks to pass right through him!\nThe key to defeating this foe is to learn his attacks, and more importantly learning which parts leave him vulnerable to counters, and when you won't able to hurt him. Whenever he becomes transparent, avoid using any moves like Immobilize as you'll just waste their cooldowns and mana.",

Ignore the urge to retaliate, and instead wait a moment for him to follow-up with an incorporeal backhand followed by a blazing palm strike.\nYou'll have two options to counter this move: by dodging the third and final strike, you can use this time to capitalize on the end of his combo with Immobilize or Spirit Attacks to send him stumbling.",
