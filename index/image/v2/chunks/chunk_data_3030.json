Don't wait until then to begin harvesting though—it's still worth grabbing any you find so you can craft as much as you need when the option is available. The more supplies you have in stock, the more advantages you can bring into a fight, including buffs to attack power, damage negation, and resistance!\n* **Experiment with different playstyles and stances.** Since you can reset your skills at any point when resting at a Shrine, try experimenting with different playstyles or favoring specific stances if you run into a roadblock. There's skills to improve just about anything, and there's no wrong answer to investing in a particular tree.",

You'll be able to find different Gourds that can have a certain amount of use or extra effect, Drinks that can heal you all at once or over time, and Soaks that provide additional effects along with the health boost. Try tailoring the Soak or Drink to your current challenge: a higher health boost at the cost of healing over time is better when exploring versus going against a fast-paced boss, and certain soaks may allow you to gain resistance to a certain enemy attack.\n* **Once your Gourd has been upgraded to absorb Spirits, you can also gain an additional benefit: Absorbing Green Wisps**. Not only does this get you Will, but replenishes an additional use for your Gourd. If you defeat a tough enemy or Miniboss that leaves behind its Spirit, you'll replenish your entire Gourd once it's claimed!",
