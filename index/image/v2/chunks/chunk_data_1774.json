When used outside of a combo, they can be charged up to the number of focus points that you have unlocked, with each level of charge dramatically increasing the amount of damage the heavy attack will deal.\nWhen used in combos with the standard attack button, you'll perform a Varied Combo, assuming you’ve unlocked the specific Varied Combo from the skill tree in that stance. Varied combos require one point of focus, and unlike standalone heavy attacks, cannot be charged.
