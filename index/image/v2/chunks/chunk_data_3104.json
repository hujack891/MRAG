These will launch themselves at you with their spears, resulting in an explosion. It'll start with one duplicate launching themselves at you, then two, and finally, a set of three will attack.\nThe best way to approach this is to stay locked on the Red Boy, but move as far back in the area as you can. If you need to, use any rocks nearby that haven't been destroyed. You can then dodge in any direction to evade the attacks and do a quick double tap of dodge when you have multiple duplicates coming at you. If you're finding it difficult to dodge the attacks, Cloudstep can help you direct some of the attention away from yourself.",
