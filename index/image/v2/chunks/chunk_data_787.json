His most common one starts with an uppercut punch, and then a downward strike after a short pause, and is then followed by a huge sweeping claw swipe that spins him around. If you want to try using Rock Solid, save it for the swipe so he doesn’t attack through his first two swings.\nAnnoyingly, he can also employ a similar strike with only the first two hits, but at a much more rapid pace.",
    "img_below_text": "He also has a different combo strike that often begins with a downward fist punch, followed by two large horizontal claw swipes that spin his body, and ends with him ripping his fist out of the ground in a rising swipe as he leaps backward with the momentum.
