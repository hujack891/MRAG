Head right and drop down the wooden platforms to reach the ground below. Instead of climbing the stairs to enter the village, turn right and head into a webbed corridor. Turn left at the illuminated spot in the corridor to find a secret entrance covered in cocoons. Destroy the cocoons to fight your way inside and find the Puppet Spider waiting for you there.",

It also has poison to shoot in your direction and a couple of worms that emerge from egg sacs to fight alongside it.
