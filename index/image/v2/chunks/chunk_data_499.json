Generally speaking, when an enemy initiates their attack, that's the moment you want to press R2 and Triangle (PS5), RB and Y (PC/Controller) or 2 (PC/Keyboard).\nEach enemy will have different timings to their attacks, however, so it might take some practice getting it right for the different Yaoguais. Look for visual prompts such as enemies raising their weapons and shields or leaning back to spot the start of their attacks.",
