Ignore the Scorching Flame enemy, as the ball will take care of this.\nAs the ball breaks through even further, run with it. You want it to be as far forward as it can go before you go up and to the gap on the left. Another Searing-Flame will appear here, and then you'll find a gap very close to you on the right, with yet another Searing-Flame.",
    "img_below_text": "The gauntlet is almost over! As you continue on, there's a small gap on the left you can dart into and then it's onward toward the flames. When you approach, a cutscene will begin where you'll see the golden spiked ball go flying off the end of the cliff.\nAfter the cutscene, ignore Pingping running off, and turn back to where you came from. Remember the wall of flames? Head back there. Now that the ball is gone, it's safe to explore the area slowly and you'll find the flames have also disappeared. A path has been revealed, which is the Cooling Slope, and the next place we'll explore.",
