He can perform some surprisingly agile lunging attacks, and his multi-hit sword swings can deal a lot of damage. Each of his combos end with a large downward slam, and gives you a wide opening to begin your counter-attack as he struggles to pull his blade out of the ground. For as tough as he is, he luckily won’t respawn when defeated.\nOnce he’s gone, help yourself to the chest to find 2 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 5 **Tiny Piece of Gold**!",

By holding down the L2/LT button, you can move your staff quickly to deflect incoming arrows. The Wolf will usually begin with a barrage of quick arrow shots, so be sure to keep holding the button down rather than tapping it until he stops. The move costs stamina to maintain so you can’t block shots forever — as soon as the arrows stop flying, dash across and defeat him before he finds more arrows.\n![Wukong Wolves 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cc/Wukong_Wolves_31.jpg)",
