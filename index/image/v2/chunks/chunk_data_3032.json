In fact, there is a way to close the distance -- you can jump and perform a heavy attack in midair to gain extra height before slamming down, which can often give you the boost you need to reach their platform.\n* **Alternatively, Cloud Step will get you past ranged attackers without being spotted.** If you prefer a stealthier approach, or you're just trying to get beyond a row of archers, using the Cloud Step spell can help massively. Enemies will focus on your replica and leave you to sneak past.",

Keep progressing through the game and you'll unlock the ability to stagger enemies and open them up to counterattacks.\n* **You'll know when you've performed a perfect dodge, because replicas of your character will appear.** You'll even see multiple of yourself if you can perform chains of dodges. If you're finding that you're good at evading attacks, invest in skills points along the Stamina tree that will allow you to dodge without having light attacks interrupted, increase the focus you gain from dodging, and even create an illusion of your character that will explode.",
