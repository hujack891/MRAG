That said, he does hit harder and can empower certain moves, so don’t assume this will be a cakewalk. You’ll want to have upgraded your staff after defeating the Whiteclad Noble to dish out more damage, and using the Wandering Wight’s Spirit on this guy can help tremendously.",
    "img_below_text": "The big twist on this fight that you’ll notice immediately is all the wandering bronze-colored corpses milling about the arena. The good news is they actually aren’t a threat — at least at first. This means you can focus on attacking the boss without worrying about one of them randomly clawing at you, but there’s more to it than that.\nThough you can’t directly target them, you can kill them with a single swipe of your staff. Doing so will actually cause their spirit to be directly absorbed, and heal you for a small amount. It’s not enough that you should be turning your back to the boss to seek them out exactly, but there are situations where you’ll need to distance yourself from Jinchi’s tremor and earthquake attacks that provide a pause in combat where you might as well hit one nearby to get a bit of your health restored. That’s not all these corpses do, but we’ll get to the rest in a bit.",
