At the start of the fight you'll only have to dodge one, but over time she'll do more and more of these for the first part of her attack.\nShe'll often follow up these strikes by finishing her sentence with \"clashes form bolts\" and then toss a projectile straight at you from her hand, requiring a second dodge before can get close and retaliate.",
