On the opposite side of the arena, you will find a wooden plank leading to another area. Pass over the plank and head down to find a small crack in the wall. Interact with the crack to squeeze through and end up in the den of the Swift Bat.",
    "img_below_text": "## Swift Bat Fight\nThe Swift Bat isn't a boss like the Earth Wolf or Wandering Wight, but is still a reasonably difficult fight in its own right. Swift Bats are extremely fast and can be difficult to reach when they're up in the sky. You can expect to be swooped by the Swift Bat, hit with a volley of projectiles, or swiped at with the beast's clawed hands.",
