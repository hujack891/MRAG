To find him, head to the Shrine and look over the bridge opposite it. The lake that you see under the bridge is the lake where you can find the Crow Diviner. You can cross the bridge and make your way down the hill to reach the lake without getting any fall damage, or carefully jump down the cliff on the Shrine side.",
    "img_below_text": "## Crow Diviner Fight\nThe Crow Diviner fights with a sword and deals frost damage. He also uses a skill that renders him almost invisible, making him blend into the white snow around the area. He's not completely invisible while using this move. You can still make out his outline just like you can still see yourself while using the Cloud Step spell, but it definitely complicates things all the same. Lock onto him so you don't lose him when he is using this skill.",
