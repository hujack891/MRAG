The blast will immediately stun him, and he will be unable to complete the charge (the downside is you usually only have enough Qi to use it once, and he's known to employ this move multiple times).\nIf you have 3 focus points already banked, you can also quickly unleash a charged strike with the Thrust Stance to stagger him out of, but your reaction speed will need to be very quick.",

It's this attack and this one only that will completely knock the wind out of him, and stop him from performing the rest of his dive-bombs and slams, which will not stagger him if you try deflecting those.\nEven outside this new attack of his, the last half of the fight will be even deadlier as he follows up many of his basic attacks with more sweeps and spins than before.",
