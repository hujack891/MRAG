    "img_below_text": "## Rat Imperial Guard Fight\nThe Rat Imperial Guard fight is difficult, not because the foe himself is particularly powerful, but because he has two other Rat Imperial Guards fighting by his side. Rat Imperial Guards are extremely fast and fight with dual-handed scythe-like weapons. Perfect Dodging their swipes will help you out greatly in this battle.
