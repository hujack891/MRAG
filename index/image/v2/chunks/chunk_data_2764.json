To find him, defeat Zhu Bajie and the Violet Spider and make your way out of the Webbed Hollow cavern. Pass through the Forest of Felicity and look to the right on the path to the Temple of the Yellow Flowers to find the Commander Beetle teaching his class.",
    "img_below_text": "## Commander Beetle Fight\nThe Commander Beetle fight is a tough one since the beetle is so strong, and he has a whole class of monks to tackle at the same time.
