The fight is fairly straightforward in this first phase, but as soon as you've defeated the horse guai, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains drops the Yin-Yang Fish into the water.\nThe giant creature soon emerges and will begin attacking. It has a variety of moves that you'll see it perform during the fight. But the main thing is now you should make use of all your spells and transformations that you saved from the first round.",
    "img_below_text": "You'll see the Yin-Yang Fish rear itself up from the water and spray a jet at you, or flip itself up and over, to try and hit you with a tail flick. Staying close to it will stop it from being able to hit you with the jet spray, but will make it more likely to try and tail-whip you.\nIt will also use projectiles and throw out orbs to chase you down. These can be dodged or outrun in a similar manner to that of the Keeper of the Flaming Mountain's attacks.",
