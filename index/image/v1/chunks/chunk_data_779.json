It has a solid basic combo, a fantastic heavy attack, and a self-destruct attack that can completely destroy groups of enemies.\nWith it, you can transform into a rat guai, slashing at the enemy while blowing fierce flames at them, inflicting Scorch Bane. Focus built up before transformation can be converted for use afterwards within the rat guai's form.\nAshen Slumber's moveset is as follows:\n* **Light Attack: Chop Wood - Swing the iron blade to build up Focus.** This is a standard four-hit combo.\n\n* **Heavy Attack: Blow Fire - Hold heavy attack to unleash, consuming Focus to continuously burn enemies ahead.** This is a great crowd-control move, damaging enemies with a continuous stream of fire for several seconds ahead of it.",
