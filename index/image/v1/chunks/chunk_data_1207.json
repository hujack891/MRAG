Taking double damage from any of his attacks is highly inadvisable, so make sure your Shock-Quelling Powder is on your quickbar for this fight.\nYellowbrow chiefly attacks with a large spiked mace while he holds his magic seedbag in the other hand. Be incredibly wary of his weapon, as it has the ability to change its shape, and he can extend the handle at will both in size, length, and flexibility.\n\nOnce all the motes coalesce into his weapon, he'll slam it into the ground to create a massive electrical storm, and soon after, a giant detonation that can usually kill you in a single hit. This attack can't be dodged (even in Pillar Stance), but it can be outrun if you flee to the far corners of the room away from him (though it still has a mighty range).\n\nIf you feel like you can't escape in time, you can also try interrupting this attack - the Wind Tamer Vessel is a great pick for this as it will stun him no matter what he's doing!",
