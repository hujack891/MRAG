Items like the Tiger Subduing Pellets to raise your attack and others that can raise your stamina or focus can all help out greatly, and you'll want every advantage on your side.\n\nSince things are rarely as easy as they seem, eliminating his health bar will trigger phase two, whereupon he'll break his restraints and not only fight you with his fists, but supercharge his limbs to deal an insane amount of damage!",
