Though this is another boss with a limited moveset, it can be easy to die to the Poison Chiefs if you're not careful.\n\nThe biggest issue is the poison attacks, and it's essential to interrupt them as often as you can. The Plantain Fan can prove invaluable here once again, especially if you deploy it just before a poison attack. It will push the Poison Chief back and allow you to follow up with attacks. Use Immobilize when the Plantain Fan has stopped working, to keep it in place and deplete its health as quickly as possible.\n\nPoison Chief 1",
