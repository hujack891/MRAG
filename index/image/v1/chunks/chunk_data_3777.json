Below you'll find important tips for both exploration and combat to start you on the right foot.\n* **Jump to:**\n* **General Tips**\n* **Combat Tips**\n* Exploration Tips**\n## Exploration Tips\n\n* **You can't parry naturally, but you can unlock spells that allow you to deflect**. Keep progressing through the game and you'll unlock the ability to stagger enemies and open them up to counterattacks.\n\n* **You'll know when you've performed a perfect dodge, because replicas of your character will appear.** You'll even see multiple of yourself if you can perform chains of dodges. If you're finding that you're good at evading attacks, invest in skills points along the Stamina tree that will allow you to dodge without having light attacks interrupted, increase the focus you gain from dodging, and even create an illusion of your character that will explode.\n\n* **Enemies with shields have a separate durability bar for their shield above their health.** In order to waste less time breaking it down, bait out attacks that leave them open, get behind them, or use Immobilize and Cloud Step to pierce past their defense.\n\n* **Don't forget that the Destined One has jump attacks, too!** A light jump attack can be a safe opener to spring you toward an enemy with a kick while leaping back to avoid danger. A heavy jump attack on the other hand can instantly expend all your Focus Points for a very quick smash attack -- and can often be used to defeat regular enemies before they can react.\n\n* **Understanding the difference between Spirit Attacks and Transformation Spells is vital to surviving tough encounters.** Spirit Attacks will temporarily transform you into a Yaoguai to unleash a single attack before returning to your form. During this time, you can't defend yourself, and can still take damage. When under the effects of a Transformation Spell, you'll have an entirely different health bar - which includes status effects - meaning you can transform to get out of danger or get hit with a status effect that won't stick around when you transform back.",
