You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis.\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Emerald-Armed Mantis\nZhu Bajie will be on the floor and pick up a mantis from the ground. It will hop inside Bajie's mouth, and you'll need to do the same to be able to fight the insect. You'll soon be transformed and literally entering the belly of the beast.\n\nAlong with these attacks, the mantis will sometimes fly up and start to slash its blades, but send out projectiles instead. Its combos will become more agile, and it will often spin around again and again with its blades creating circles around it.",
