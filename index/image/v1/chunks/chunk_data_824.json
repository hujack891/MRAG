Even a full Light Combo can send him stumbling backward, which you can mix in with a varied combo and follow up from the Smash Stance, stagger his sword swings with Rock Solid, and use a bulky Spirit attack like the Second Rat Prince to send him sprawling again and again and limit his ability to attack back.",
