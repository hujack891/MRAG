As such, you’ll want to equip yourself with the best possible gear in Chapter 2 — you may even want to complete the chapter and return back from Chapter 3 if you find yourself unable to make a dent in this boss. Make sure you’re stocked up on medicines to help bolster your damage output and damage reduction.\n\nAnother extremely deadly combo he can perform after a roar seems to last forever, making it an ideal time to try Immobilizing him or using a Transformation Spell if you’re in danger of dying from his assault. He’ll race around you before leaping close with a claw strike, followed with a delayed upward slash, and a second soon after, before keeping his arm raised for a moment and then punching down with two hits in quick succession, and a final delayed two-handed slam! Be sure you have enough stamina to keep up sustained dodging for this very long combo attack.",
