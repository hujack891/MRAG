Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.\n\nAt around half health, she'll start to get madder, and teleport high up to summon several groups of electrical bolts that will fly out in small clusters to track you down. You can't deflect them with your staff, so either use Cloud Step or stick to dodging.\n\nAfter this, she'll trigger a thunderstorm that darkens the arena, filling you the area with static electricity and most likely giving you the Shocked status effect. Take a moment to use a Shock-Quelling medicine.",
