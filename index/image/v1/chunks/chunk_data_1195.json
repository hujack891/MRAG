    "img_above_text": "# New Thunderclap Temple Walkthrough\nThe New Thunderclap Temple is the final main region of Chapter 3 in The New West in Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n* Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n* Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Yellowbrow\nNo longer the small chubby monk you've seen previously, this much larger giant of a man is an incredibly dangerous and formidable foe, and uses a host of lightning attacks to try and inflict Shock status on you. Taking double damage from any of his attacks is highly inadvisable, so make sure your Shock-Quelling Powder is on your quickbar for this fight.\nYellowbrow chiefly attacks with a large spiked mace while he holds his magic seedbag in the other hand. Be incredibly wary of his weapon, as it has the ability to change its shape, and he can extend the handle at will both in size, length, and flexibility.\n\nNow that you've finished exploring all that Chapter 3 has to offer you currently, only the final boss awaits, and it's a bit of a gauntlet.\n\nAfter resting at the Mahavira Hall Shrine at the top of the stairs, be sure to take assessment of your gear. Cultivate your best Spirits, make sure you have a lot of pills on hand an craft a bunch of extra Shock-Quelling Powder (you're going to need it).\n\nYou should also have any anti-shock gear/curios/soaks on hand as well, along with whatever else can keep you alive for awhile. This final encounter is spread out into three distinct fights, and while you'll be able to respawn and pick up where you left off for the first two sections from the Shrine, the final section won't take you back to the Shrine.\n\nWhen you're ready to take on the lord of New Thunderclap Temple, head through the door.",
