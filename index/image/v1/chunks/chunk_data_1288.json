While he doesn't deal elemental damage, he can be a hard target to pin down due to his ability to become non-corporeal, causing some of your attacks to pass right through him!\nThe key to defeating this foe is to learn his attacks, and more importantly learning which parts leave him vulnerable to counters, and when you won't able to hurt him. Whenever he becomes transparent, avoid using any moves like Immobilize as you'll just waste their cooldowns and mana.\n\nAt the entrance to this temple, you can now use the Snow Fox Brush in your inventory to transform into The Fox, and step inside to trigger a cutscene (if you enter first you can speak to him, but transforming near the monk will instantly trigger the fight without a scene).",
