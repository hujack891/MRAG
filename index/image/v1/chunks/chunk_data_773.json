    "img_above_text": "# Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master\nThe Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master is a required Yaoguai King boss fight that you can encounter in Chapter 4 of Black Myth Wukong. The leader of the Temple of Yellow Flowers and master of the Spider Guai, he is the final boss of the larger Webbed Hollow region.\n* Rewards: Golden Glowing Eye, Sky-Piercing Horn, Celestial Ribbon, Fine Gold Thread, Gold Tree Core, Kun Steel, Mind Core, 5329 Experience, 3693 Will\n## Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master Boss Fight and Guide\nThe first time you approach this boss fight, you'll see the depths of the depraved power the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master possesses as he absorbs the Violet Spider into his being against her will. He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).\nAs mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses.\n\nIf you see him perform an extravagant twisting somersault through the air, don't be dazzled, as he'll chain this feinting maneuver into a quick grab once he touches back on the ground and take a few step, lunging extra distance to try and yank you forward and take off a huge portion of your health with his crazy unblockable grab attack.",
    "img_below_text": "This is a good time to use your best Transformation Spell to help whittle down his health, especially if you're worried about the grab or are electrified and need to retreat. The Golden Lining transformation is a good bet for its shock resistance, and many of his massive attacks are slow enough that you can \"see through\" them to build up focus points and blast him back. If you haven't beaten Yellow Loong or aren't sure about his moves, you can also use Hoarfrost or Umbral Abyss to try freezing him, just be sure to keep on top of dodging his big blasts.\n\nThe last piece of his health bar is by far the scariest to take down, and you'll need to constantly be watching his electrified talismans to anticipate where his next big blast is coming from. If you have extra mana, you can also try going for the Pluck of Mana, or just focus on more Immobilizations and Rock Solid Deflections.\n\nOnce you've finally defeated the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, you'll be treated to the finale of the Spider Sisters and their mother. Note that you'll now gain all the Yaoguai Chief entries for the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Sister (despite you not having actually fought against them).\n\nHundred-Eyed Daoist Master",
