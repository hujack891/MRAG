In fact, you may want to attempt this optional fight later on, especially after you've completed the rest of Chapter 4 and gotten tougher armor sets and weapons before challenging him. While he doesn't have a huge moveset, the attacks he does can some fast, and when imbued with lightning can often kill you before you're able to react.\nIf you do challenge him early, you should really consider arming yourself to the teeth: Upgrade the Loongscale Armor to reduce shock duration, stock up on every medicine you can think of in addition to Shock-Quelling Powder, and ask the Xu Dog for extra pills that may include rare ones that give you boosts of health or damage increases. Such a powerful foe is deserving of your good consumables -- but you may want to practice a bit first before using them in battle.\n\nOnce you take off a good chunk of his health, the second \"phase\" will start, and things get extremely dangerous. It will begin when he stops fighting to charge up and release a blast of electricity around him.\n\nAfter he does this, he'll immediately fly at you low to the ground with a slash while imbued by electricity that is incredibly quick and hard to dodge -- and it only gets worse from here.",
