    "img_above_text": "# Hoarfrost\nHoarfrost is one of the many Transformation Spells you can obtain in Black Myth: Wukong. Upon using it, you can transform into a Monk from the Sea, weaving strikes with a blizzard's grace and launching attacks that inflict Frost Bane. Any focus built up before transformation can be converted for use afterwards, too.\nCompared to some of the other Transformations in the game, Hoarfrost can be found quite easily as you get towards the end of The New West. Hoarfrost's moveset is as follows:\n* **Light attack: Tentacle Flick - Alternate Strikes with both tentacles building Focus with each hit.** This is a simple, multi-hit combo attack that builds Focus with each hit landed.\n* **Heavy Attack: Tentacle Sweep: Swing back the tentacles to sweep attack, amassing more Focus.** This is a strong ground attack that can sweep enemeis off their feet and away from you, building up substantial Focus quickly.\n* **Spell: Ice Sheet - Create an Ice Sheet. The more the Focus, the better the effect.** \\- With 1 Focus point, you can create an Ice Sheet that smashes into the ground, dealing Frost Bane damage. 3 Focus points causes this effect to last longer and have a greater range.\n## Black Myth: Wukong Hoarfrost Location\nHoarfrost can be found in The New West, from the New Thunderclap Temple - Temple Entrance Shrine. From the Shrine, turn and head inside the temple through the opening in the large red wall. Follow the path up, and then to the left until you see some open doors. On this overlook through the doors, you can find the Monk from the Sea boss, whom you will need to defeat to earn the Transformation.",
