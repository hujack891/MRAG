He’s fairly formidable in his own right, and you’ll need to learn his attacks to win the duel. The Yellow-Robed Squire is a big fan of hurling dust clouds in your direction to mask his movements, and you’ll need to be even more reactive than usual to make sure you don’t get blindsided.\n\nAnother common attack combo he will perform will be to drag his claws slowly through the ground and pull them upward to attack and spread sand — which you can easily spot and deflect to interrupt him. If you don’t, he’ll charge forward through the sand to stab with his extended claws.",
