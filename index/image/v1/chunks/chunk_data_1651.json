Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of Yellow Wind Ridge: Sandgate Village, as well as how to defeat its many bosses that include Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, the Earth Wolf, the King of Flowing Sands and his First and Second Rat Princes.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Village Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* Yaoguai Chief - Earth Wolf\n* Yaoguai Chief - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n* **Valley of Despair**\n* Yaoguai Chief - First Prince of Flowing Sands\n## Village Entrance\nMake sure to take the time to view the new additions to the Chapter 2’s Shrines menu. Note that you can still freely fast travel back to any Shrine in Chapter 1’s Black Wind Mountain if you missed out on any secrets. The store is also selling very different items than it was in the previous chapter, and you’ll find that the selection will change based on which chapter you are in:\nYellow Wind Ridge Shrine Shop\n---\nAntimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |\nMind Core (x2) - 720 Will | Silk (x2) - 600 Will | Yaoguai Core (x2) - 450 Will |\nLicorice (x5) - 120 Will | Aged Ginseng (x5) - 90 Will | Fragrant Jade Flower (x5) - 120 Will | Purple Lingzhi (x5) - 90 Will\nFire Bellflower (x5) - 120 Will | Jade Lotus (x5) - 90 Will | |\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Earth Wolf\nThis strange looking yaoguai has a lot of rushing attacks that are hard to get a sense of due to its attack patterns, and you’ll want to utilize your Immobilize spell for help interrupting these when possible.\n\nBe sure to open up the gate nearby to unlock a shortcut back to the Village Entrance. As an added bonus, all the Rat Archers posted on the gate’s roof have jumped down, and you can ambush the entire group. Your Sage’s Relic should now indicate an enemy who has a Spirit you can absorb, and sure enough you can spot a tougher Rat Archer than the rest with blue flames. Defeat him, and you’ll be able to absorb the Rat Archer Spirit. As an added bonus, all the Rat Archers will no longer spawn here!",
