You can interact to hear a voice -- coming not from the body, but from the fox pelt around its neck. Apparently that story about the snow fox and the human you saw after completing Chapter 2 actually happened, and the fox guai wants revenge.\nShe'll gift you the Snow Fox Brush, allowing you to take the form of the Snow Fox and seek out the human scholar who resides in New Thunderclap Temple.\nHowever, it's a long road to get there, and you can't attack in this form, so for now it's better that you De-transform, and use the key item later on when you're close to your target.",
