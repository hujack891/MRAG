    "img_above_text": "# The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm\n## Lower Pagoda (Level 2)\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Captain Lotus-Vision\nOne of four Captains of the Pagoda Realm, Captain Lotus-Vision is responsible for sealing many of the prison cells, and must be defeated before you can unlock them. He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\n\nOnce you take out around a third of his health, he'll teleport back near his original position, and shatter the remaining corpses as he draws power, creating a large and intricate circle of runic power behind him.\n\nThings will get extremely dangerous and annoying at this point, as he'll not only unleash a constant beam from his crystal, but the ring behind him will form smaller rings to blast you from four different locations. This will result in dodging on top of dodging as you have to escape the constant laser, and also four different blasts, and a final blast from all four circles at once.",
