Below you'll find a guide for the Temple and its main boss fight against the Tiger Vanguard, as well as the secret Cellar beneath it once you have the Keeness of Tiger.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai King - Tiger Vanguard\n* **Temple Cellar**\nThe Crouching Tiger Temple is one of the two sub-regions you’ll need to explore in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong in order to unlock the large sealed doors that lead to the end of the chapter. You can first reach this area by heading through the Sandgate Village and defeating the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, taking the left path through the Valley of Despair and through a crack in the wall leading to a small canyon.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Tiger Vanguard\nCompared to the slow and measured slams of the Stone Vanguard, the Tiger Vanguard is a relentless beast of a foe. You’ll need to be well prepared to take him down, and make sure you have the best armor and weapons crafted. If you haven’t been using them much before, now is also an excellent time to invest in crafting consumable medicines. Items like the Evil Repelling Medicament to reduce incoming damage, and the Tiger Subduing Pellets to increase your own.\n\nThe first instance is the easiest to spot, as he’ll assume a new stance putting two fingers in front of his face while his other hand rests on the handle of his sword. After a shout, he’ll unleash a single slashing attack that hits hard enough to launch its own projectile slash. Caught unaware, and it’ll easily take off more than half your health bar! It’s also the easiest one to punish, as he’ll usually take the time to put the blade back before starting his next attack, giving you a lot of time to strike back.",
