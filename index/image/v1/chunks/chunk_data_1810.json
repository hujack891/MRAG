Despite that, the Macaque Chief is not to be taken lightly. Many of his attacks inflict Frost, and if your bar fills, you'll have extremely reduced mobility and be unable to dodge many of his attacks. Plan ahead by crafting or buying Body-Warming Pills to offset this.\n\nFinally, if you spend to much time dishing out damage to his face, he'll eventually counter with an unexpected move: puking on you. This will deal an immense amount of poison buildup, so be ready to Immobilize or dodge around behind him.\n\nWith his small frame, the Macaque Chief is fairly susceptible to being staggered with charged up heavy strikes. Build up your focus from light attack combos when dodging him, and then knock him down with big hits or after deflecting his moves.",
