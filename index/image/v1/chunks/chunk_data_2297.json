Below you'll find a guide for the Valley of Ecstasy Region, including how to reach the valley itself by defeating Non-White, and exploring the different parts of the valley to uncover several Yaoguai Chiefs on the path to the New Thunderclap Temple, and completing the Treasure Hunter's Quest and the Pagoda Realm Prisoner's Quest by defeating the final Captain.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Mindfulness Cliff**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-White\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-White (Round Two)\n* **Forest of Felicity**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n* **Brook of Bliss**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Able\n* **Towers of Karma**\n* Yauoguai Chief - Old Ginseng Guai\n* **Longevity Road**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Captain Kalpa-Wave\nAfter you solved the monk's riddle by praying at four Buddha Statues in the Precept Corridor, you'll split up from Zhu Bajie and make your way into the belly button of a large Buddha statue along the cliffs, taking you up a narrow pathway and into the Mindfulness Cliff.\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\nLike the two Frog Guai before him, Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang is a formidable foe with surprising reach, and if you thought you'd seen everything a frog boss could do, you're sadly in for a surprise. Much as Chapter 2's frog boss was imbued with lightning attacks, so too does this boss have the power of ice on his side, and unless you take precautions, you'll be frozen solid and out of stamina -- unable to move while you're torn to pieces.\nHaving body warming medicine for this fight is a must, and it's highly recommended you equip the Frostspout Twig Curio, Fiery Gourd, and Circle of Fire Spell to offset his many frost-filled attacks.\n\nHe can also take a deep breath and bellow chilled air straight at you, which can make it tough to get out of his range unless you lock him down with Immobilize or Cloud Step away.\n\nAny time his icy attacks create a frost field, you'll need to evacuate quickly from the affected area, or you'll rapidly become chilled and eventually immobile while your stamina is sapped.\n\nRemember to take control of the battlefield, and dictate where the fighting happens by luring him away from any lingering frost field that tend to stay longer than you'd expect. He'll always end up coming to you, so back up and be ready to retaliate when he lunges forth.",
