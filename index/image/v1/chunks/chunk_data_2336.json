Though it is a short area, it will prove to be a challenging one as you go up against the greedy King of the Mountain. Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the cave to the mountaintop, as well as how to defeat the boss of this area in his two forms, the Black Wind King and the Black Bear Guai.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Cave Interior**\n* Black Wind King\n* **Outside the Cave**\n* **Bodhi Peak**\n* Black Bear Guai\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Black Bear Guai\nInstead of a spear, the Black Wind King is now going for overwhelming size and power, and similar to the main boss of the Forest of Wolves, you’ll be up against a very large opponent with huge attack swings. To make matters worse, several parts of the arena are on fire and will absolutely start burning you if you roll into them for too long.\n\nWhen you’ve at least reached the top of the mountain, it’s time to do one final inventory before approaching the final boss of Chapter 1:\n\n* Make sure you’ve rung the 3 bells, and fought the secret boss to obtain the Legendary Fireproof Mantle.\n* With the secret boss defeated, you’ll be able to craft most if not all of the Bronze Gear Set for the best armor increase and Immobilize bonuses.\n* You should have also claimed all 3 Celestial Pills to increase your max health, mana, and stamina.\n* Make sure you’ve defeated that optional strong mini-boss, the Wandering Wight back in the Forest of Wolves, not only to gain his Spirit, but to obtain the Cat’s Eye Beads Curio.\n* Cultivate the Spirit you like the most with at least two upgrades if possible (we recommend the Wight for its passive defense increase and massive damaging headbutt).\n* Ensure both your Gourd and Coconut Wine have both been upgraded by the Shen Monkey, and equip the Lotus Seeds as your soak.\n\nThis is also a good time to buy the rest of the medicinal items from the store at the Shrine. They don’t replenish over time, and the wares will be different when you reach the next chapter, so there’s no real reason not to stock up.\n\nOnce you’re ready, head up to the peak to find a large pagoda where the first of the Six Senses of the Great Sage rests. Before you can claim it, you’ll have to go through the true form of the Black Wind King.",
