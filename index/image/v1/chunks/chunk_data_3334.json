Much of this fight will be learning his basic combos early, but being ready to adapt when he tricks you with extended attacks when you may otherwise think you have an opening.\n\nYou can also now loot the **Treasure Chest** he was guarding, though it may only contain a rare consumable like a single Loong Aura Amplification Pellet.",
