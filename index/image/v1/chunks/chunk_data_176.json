Below, you'll find a Walkthrough of the first major area of Mount Huaguo as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Verdant Path**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Supreme Inspector\n* Yaoguai Chief - Jiao-Loong of Waves\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 1\n* Yaoguai Chief - Feng-Tail General\n* **Rhino Watch Slope**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 2\n* Yaoguai Chief - Gold Armored Rhino\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Baw-Baw\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 3\n* **Deer Sight Forest**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Cloudtreading Deer\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 4\n* Yaoguai Chief - Water-Wood Beast\n* **Mantis-Catching Swamp**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Emerald-Armed Mantis\n* Yaoguai Chief - Son of Stones\n* Yaoguai King - Giant Shigandang\nThe beginning of Chapter 6 is a linear path, so proceed down the slope from where you spawn. As you make your way along this road, you'll be intercepted by the last of the Lesser Yoaguais you need to complete your journal.\n## Mantis-Catching Swamp\nNow that you've cleaned up the majority of the optional bosses, it's time to find the last of the main bosses. You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis.\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Emerald-Armed Mantis\nZhu Bajie will be on the floor and pick up a mantis from the ground. It will hop inside Bajie's mouth, and you'll need to do the same to be able to fight the insect. You'll soon be transformed and literally entering the belly of the beast.\n\nThe mantis will now become quite erratic with its movements, flipping all around the stomach. Immobilize will help out with this, but so will the Plantain Fan, which will push the Mantis back to a part of the stomach and pin it there for you to attack. It will also stop it from being able to fly too much in the air.",
