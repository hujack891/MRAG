As such, you’ll want to equip yourself with the best possible gear in Chapter 2 — you may even want to complete the chapter and return back from Chapter 3 if you find yourself unable to make a dent in this boss. Make sure you’re stocked up on medicines to help bolster your damage output and damage reduction.\n\nIf you don’t dodge as he lands, he’ll send you into the air, grab you, and slam you repeatedly into the ground — which usually ends in instant death if you have anything less than full health.",
