The Stone Monkey is shown mid-action, likely performing a ground-pounding attack that generates a shockwave, as evidenced by the flying debris and rocks surrounding him.

The setting features a water-covered battlefield with a large, mystical structure in the background, adding to the dramatic atmosphere of the encounter.
