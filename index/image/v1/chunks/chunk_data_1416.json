He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\n\nOne of the more confusing attacks can happen when he floats up higher into the air, prompting the rings in each corner to send beams straight up in the air. beams will then start appearing at random angles in the ceiling to strike the floor in more and more locations, limiting your movement.
