He's a formidable blacksmith who you can interact with to finally upgrade your armor, allowing you to raise the armor ratings of sets you've found previously but became outdated. He also sells unlimited quantities of lower materials if you need to quickly craft or upgrade older gear.\nYou can even choose to challenge the Yin Tiger to a duel, but be warned, he is incredibly deadly, and likely way beyond your current level.
