He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\n\nEarly on, basic attacks will include a large circle of projectiles that expel from the crystal before arcing toward you. Other times, it will expel a trio of projectiles in three short bursts before they track you down in waves.",
