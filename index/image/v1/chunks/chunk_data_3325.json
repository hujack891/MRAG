You'll need a a lot of armor to withstand his hits, and plenty of poison defense to boot, which means using the Gall Soak, and poison-resistant curios to help you out.\nIf you recall your fights with the three Scorpion Princes in the Webbed Hollow, you may find more than a few of the Scorpionlord's attacks familiar, but don't be lulled into thinking you have him figured out: all of his moves strike faster, hit harder, and will evolve into longer combos as the fight drags on. Much of this fight will be learning his basic combos early, but being ready to adapt when he tricks you with extended attacks when you may otherwise think you have an opening.\n\nHe'll then launch into a series of quick and relentless tail swipes, starting with an upward slash, a downward slam, followed by a quick low sweep, and then a final extremely damaging thrust from behind his back. The timing of these strikes can be challenging to time correctly, and he'll punctuate three of the four strikes as he shouts \"Taste my... deathsting!\" Due to how powerful this move is, you'll need to practice timing your dodges perfectly to avoid getting hit and poisoned by his strikes.",
