Below, you'll find a Walkthrough of the first major area of Mount Huaguo as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Verdant Path**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Supreme Inspector\n* Yaoguai Chief - Jiao-Loong of Waves\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 1\n* Yaoguai Chief - Feng-Tail General\n* **Rhino Watch Slope**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 2\n* Yaoguai Chief - Gold Armored Rhino\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Baw-Baw\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 3\n* **Deer Sight Forest**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Cloudtreading Deer\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 4\n* Yaoguai Chief - Water-Wood Beast\n* **Mantis-Catching Swamp**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Emerald-Armed Mantis\n* Yaoguai Chief - Son of Stones\n* Yaoguai King - Giant Shigandang\nThe beginning of Chapter 6 is a linear path, so proceed down the slope from where you spawn. As you make your way along this road, you'll be intercepted by the last of the Lesser Yoaguais you need to complete your journal.\n## Mantis-Catching Swamp\nNow that you've cleaned up the majority of the optional bosses, it's time to find the last of the main bosses. You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis.\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n### Yaoguai King - Giant Shigandang\n\nIts main attack is to punch down with its giant fists, which unsurprisingly, will one-shot you if you're hit by them. The easiest way to avoid them is to just back up as far away from them as possible. Then, once the Giant Shigandang pauses punching, run up to the fists and keep hitting the blue crystals.\n\nThe other attack that the Shigandang does is to punch both fists down and send out ripples. Again, you want to hang back as much as you can. The rings will come toward you, and you can jump over them to avoid them. There are times when he'll raise both hands in the air, and seem like he's about to perform this attack, but instead, he's actually going to slam his fists down and just lay there for a bit. This is the perfect time to get in close and attack him.",
