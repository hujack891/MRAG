You can also resummon the Shigandang later for a fairer matchup once you've gotten stronger.\n\nWhen the fight starts you’ll need to watch out for an incoming leaping strike with one of its front arms, which it will usually follow up by rearing up and then slamming down with both arms pulled out around its front.",
