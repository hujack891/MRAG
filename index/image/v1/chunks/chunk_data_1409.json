He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\n\nThings will get more difficult any time you see the crystal on his staff flare brighter. These brief flashes indicate a laser beam blast that you'll only have a moment to dodge or take considerable damage, and you'll have to deal with even more as time goes on. Early on, watch for a laser to shoot out as he creates projectiles rings before you start spinning your staff.",
