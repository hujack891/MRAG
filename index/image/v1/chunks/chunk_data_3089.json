The Yellow Wind Sage has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, and is not only a deadly attacker, but a master of the Samadhi Winds — but more on that later.\nMake sure you're suitably prepared for the fight in the best ways possible: Craft a bunch of medicine to increase your damage absorption and max health, and allocate any Mind Cores you’ve found toward Celestial Medicine buffs. You should also have a full set of either the Galeguard or Insect armor fully crafted, as well as the Cloud-Patterened Stone Staff from defeating the optional Sihandang boss. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you’ve beaten the Chapter 2 Secret Boss and equipped the new Vessel, the Wind Tamer.\n\nOnce he’s down to the last quarter of health, he’ll prepare another sandstorm and grab the head back from where it’s been floating up above. During this period he’ll also summon a sand tornado to move around the arena, which you’ll need to avoid at all costs — especially if the Wind Tamer hasn’t recharged enough to use it again.",
