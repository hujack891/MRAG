You can first reach this area by heading through the Sandgate Village and defeating the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, taking the left path through the Valley of Despair and through a crack in the wall leading to a small canyon.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Tiger Vanguard\nCompared to the slow and measured slams of the Stone Vanguard, the Tiger Vanguard is a relentless beast of a foe. You’ll need to be well prepared to take him down, and make sure you have the best armor and weapons crafted. If you haven’t been using them much before, now is also an excellent time to invest in crafting consumable medicines. Items like the Evil Repelling Medicament to reduce incoming damage, and the Tiger Subduing Pellets to increase your own.\n\nThings can get even more dangerous when you see him assume a martial arts stance with one fist in front of him. Be ready for him to approach with a spinning kick that you’ll need to wait to dodge until the last moment. He’ll follow up with two quick punches, and then leap high into the air for a moment before twisting his body to come crashing down with a punching slam. He won’t shake this hand off, but you will at least have some room to fight back after he lands and slowly pulls his fist back up.",
