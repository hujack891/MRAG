The description suggests it is a unique cluster of will that cannot be cultivated, encouraging exploration of its potential elsewhere. The inventory includes various other items, each with a quantity of one, except for one item with a quantity of six. The screen also shows options for examining, sorting, and returning, with a quote at the bottom stating, \"As the thoughts linger, the spirit slowly wanes.\" The player's current currency or resource count is 19,772."
