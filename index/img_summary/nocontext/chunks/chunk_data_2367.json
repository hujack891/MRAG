    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a player character, wielding a spear with a fiery aura, is engaged in combat with a large, monstrous enemy. The enemy has a large, rock-like head and is attacking with a weapon. In the background, another creature with a glowing green core is visible. The game's user interface shows various icons and meters, including health, abilities, and resources like \"Will\" points, which are currently at 107. The environment is dark and rocky, suggesting a cave or underground setting."
