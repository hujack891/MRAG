The highlighted item is the \"Centipede Guai,\" classified as an Epic spirit with a high Qi cost. Its ability, \"Rolling Ball,\" allows the player to transform into a giant ball to collide with enemies, enhancing movement speed slightly. The interface includes options to equip the item, watch a demo, and shows various stats such as health, attack power, and defense. The player's current currency and spirit count are visible at the top right corner."
