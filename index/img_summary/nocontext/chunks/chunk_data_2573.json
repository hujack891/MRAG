    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a rocky, mountainous environment. Two characters are standing near a stone wall with carved faces. The character on the left is wearing a yellow robe and has a large spherical object on their back, while the character on the right is dressed in armor and holding a staff. The caption at the bottom of the image reads: \"It houses a treasure that none other can see â€” a scale shed by the Old Loong King of Jing River upon his beheading.\" This suggests a quest or narrative involving a hidden treasure related to the Old Loong King."
