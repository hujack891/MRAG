    "img_summary": "The image is split into two sections, both depicting scenes from a video game. On the left side, a character is seen navigating a rocky terrain, heading towards an area illuminated by a warm, orange light. An arrow points towards this illuminated area, suggesting it is a point of interest or a direction to follow. On the right side, the same character is crouched in a dimly lit cave-like environment, approaching a large pot highlighted with a dashed red circle, indicating it is an important object or target within the game. The interface displays some icons and controls at the bottom right corner, typical of a video game HUD."
