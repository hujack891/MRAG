    "img_summary": "The image displays a video game interface focused on the \"Equipment\" section, specifically highlighting a rare spirit called \"Bull Governor.\" This spirit has a high Qi cost and offers the ability to take the form of Bull Governor, allowing the player to charge at foes and cleave with a halberd, dealing Scorch Damage upon impact. The equipped effect moderately increases Scorch Damage. The interface shows various spirits available for selection, along with player stats such as health, attack, and defense. The player can press 'F' in combat to use the Bull Governor ability and 'E' to equip it."
