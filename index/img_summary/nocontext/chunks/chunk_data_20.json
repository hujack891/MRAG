The spell has a high might cost and involves transforming into a rat guai, which allows the player to slash at enemies while emitting fierce flames, inflicting Scorch Bane. The description suggests focusing before transformation for later use. The spell is marked as \"Awakened,\" and there are options to view talent, soak in, or return."
