    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character is crouching in a snowy environment, holding a spear-like weapon. The character is positioned near a stone structure with intricate designs and a large pillar. In the background, another character is visible on an elevated platform, seemingly preparing to attack with a glowing weapon. The game's interface shows various icons and gauges, including health and stamina bars, and the word \"Will\" with a count of 66. The setting appears to be a temple or historical building, surrounded by snow-covered terrain."
