A character is engaged in combat with a creature named \"Cyan Loong,\" as indicated by the health bar at the bottom of the screen. The character appears to be performing a special attack, with visual effects suggesting movement and energy. On the left side of the screen, there are instructions for two types of attacks: \"Light Attack 'Moon Dance,'\" which involves continuously slashing at the enemy to build up Focus, and \"Heavy Attack 'Moon Chase,'\" which unleashes a series of dash attacks. The game interface includes health and status indicators at the bottom and right side of the screen."
