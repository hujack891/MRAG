    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game showing the equipment menu. It highlights the \"Rat Imperial Guard\" spirit, classified as a rare item with a moderate Qi cost. The spirit's ability, \"Meat Cleaver,\" allows the player to take the form of the Rat Imperial Guard, enabling nimble attacks on targets. The equipped effect moderately increases focus from perfect dodges. The player's current stats, including health, attack power, and other attributes, are displayed on the right side of the screen. The menu options at the top include Self-Advance, Relics, Equipment, Inventory, Journal, and Settings."
