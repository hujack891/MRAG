    "img_summary": "The image displays a section of a video game interface focused on upgrading spirits. The highlighted spirit is named \"Guangmou,\" classified as Epic, with a high Qi cost. The description suggests that snakes will retreat once their venom is depleted. The upgraded effect reduces the Qi cost for the skill, while the equipped effect moderately increases poison damage and resistance. The interface shows options to watch a demo and cultivate the spirit, with a current will value of 2630 out of 1500. There is also a sorting option by rarity available."
