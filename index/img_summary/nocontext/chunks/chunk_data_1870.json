    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark and eerie landscape with barren trees and rocky terrain. In the foreground, a large, humanoid creature is wielding a massive flaming weapon, possibly an axe or club. The creature appears to be covered in glowing, fiery cracks, suggesting it is imbued with some form of elemental power. Surrounding the creature are scattered flames and debris. In the background, there are stone steps leading up to a small structure, possibly a shrine or temple, flanked by stone statues. The overall atmosphere is ominous and foreboding, with a sense of desolation and danger."
