    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the video game \"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,\" showing a player character engaged in combat with a large, humanoid boss enemy. The player character is performing a move, possibly a dodge or attack, as indicated by their crouched posture and the dust and debris around them. The boss, significantly larger in size, is standing upright, and the environment appears to be a snowy courtyard with traditional Japanese architecture in the background. The game's HUD displays various icons and a health bar at the bottom of the screen, indicating the player's status and available actions."
