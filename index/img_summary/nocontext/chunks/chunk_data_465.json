The game's interface is visible, showing various icons on the left and right sides of the screen, likely representing abilities or items. At the bottom, a health bar labeled \"Fuban\" is displayed, suggesting the creature's name or the name of the opponent. The background features rocky formations and a pagoda-like structure, adding to the game's setting."
