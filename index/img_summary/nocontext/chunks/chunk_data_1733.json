    "img_summary": "The image is from a video game interface showing the equipment menu, specifically focusing on a spirit named \"Non-Able,\" classified as Epic. The spirit has a low Qi cost and features an ability called \"Seasoned Punch,\" which allows the player to take the form of Non-Able and unleash a series of punches and kicks. Different phases of Light Attack enable various moves. The equipped effect slightly increases attack, critical hit chance, and critical damage but significantly reduces maximum mana. The player can press 'F' to use the ability in combat and 'E' to equip it. The interface also displays the player's current stats, including health, stamina, and various attributes."
