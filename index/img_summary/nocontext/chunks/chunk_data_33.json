    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game, showing a character in a rocky, desert-like environment with sparse vegetation and a set of stone steps leading upwards. The character appears to be carrying a large, rocky object. On the left side of the screen, there are instructions for two attacks: \"Light Attack 'Earth Shatter'\" and \"Heavy Attack 'Mountain Splitter'.\" The light attack involves striking the enemy three times with a heavy head, while the heavy attack involves dashing forward with full force, with the option to fully charge for a further dash. At the bottom, there is a health or stamina bar with a decorative cloud design."
