A character, dressed in fur clothing and wielding a polearm, is seen facing a winged creature standing on a rocky ledge. The creature has a health bar above its head, indicating it is likely an enemy. The game's user interface displays various icons and a health bar at the bottom of the screen, suggesting the player's available actions and current health status. The word \"Will\" appears on the right side, with a count of eight, possibly indicating a resource or ability."
