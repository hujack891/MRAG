    "img_summary": "The image displays a video game interface focused on the \"Equipment\" section. It highlights the \"Civet Sergeant,\" a rare spirit with a moderate Qi cost. The description of the spirit's ability, \"Heart Ripper,\" explains that it allows the player to take the form of Civet Sergeant, juggle twin blades, and hurl them at the enemy's chest, causing the foe to suffer from a pierced heart. The equipped effect slightly increases the player's attack. The interface shows various spirits available for selection, and the current stats of the player character, including health, stamina, and attack power. The option to equip the Civet Sergeant is available, along with a demonstration video."
