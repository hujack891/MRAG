One character is using a blue energy attack against the other. In the background, there is a large statue of a seated figure, highlighted by a red arrow. The game interface displays various icons and gauges, including health bars, ability icons, and a counter labeled \"Will\" with a value of 163. The setting is dimly lit, with debris scattered on the ground and a small pile of glowing objects near the combatants."
