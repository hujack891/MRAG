The highlighted spirit is the \"Mother of Flamlings,\" classified as an Epic item with a high Qi cost. Its ability, \"Flaming Queen,\" allows the player to take the form of the Mother of Flamlings, summoning Flamlings to assist in battle by breathing fire on surrounding foes. The equipped effect moderately reduces the cooldown for all spells. The interface shows various spirits available for selection and provides options to equip, watch a demo, or close the demo. Player stats such as health, stamina, and other attributes are visible on the right side of the screen."
