    "img_summary": "The image displays a game interface focused on the \"Equipment\" section, specifically showcasing the \"Father of Stones\" spirit, which is categorized as \"Epic\" with a high Qi cost. The spirit's ability, \"Brute Force,\" allows the player to take its form and release two powerful roars that shake and damage surrounding foes. The equipped effect slightly increases critical hit chance and critical damage. The interface provides options to equip the spirit, watch a demo, and shows various stats on the right side, including health, attack, defense, and other attributes. The left panel lists other spirits available for selection."
