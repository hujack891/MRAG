    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game showing a skill tree interface. It is divided into three categories: Stamina, Martial Arts, and Survival. The highlighted section is \"Endurance,\" which is part of the Stamina category. The description indicates that each talent level in Endurance reduces the Stamina cost of Sprinting. There is an option to \"Hold to Awaken\" the skill using the 'A' button, and the player has 1 out of 1 Sparks available for use. The interface also shows navigation options with 'LB' and 'RB' for switching between different tabs."
