    "img_summary": "The image shows a third-person action scene from a video game. The player character, wearing a fur cloak, is aiming a glowing ranged attack at an enemy in a grassy, rocky environment. The enemy appears humanoid with animalistic features and is surrounded by red visual effects, possibly indicating damage or a special ability. The user interface displays health bars, ability icons, and a stamina-like meter in the bottom left corner. The setting is a dimly lit cavern with a large gate visible in the background."
