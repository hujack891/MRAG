    "img_summary": "The image displays a video game interface focused on the \"Equipment\" section, specifically highlighting an epic spirit named \"Guangmou.\" This spirit has a high Qi cost and features the ability \"Veiled Vipers,\" which allows the player to summon snakes that inflict poison damage on enemies. The snakes disappear once their venom is depleted. The equipped effect of Guangmou moderately increases poison damage and resistance. The interface provides options to equip the spirit, watch a demo, and view details. The player's stats, including health, attack, and defense, are shown on the right side of the screen."
