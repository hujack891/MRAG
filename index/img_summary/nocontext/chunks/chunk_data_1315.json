    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dimly lit cave environment with a series of five carved stone statues embedded into the rock wall. The statues appear to be of robed figures, possibly monks or deities, standing in a row. In front of the statues, there is a peculiar, organic-looking structure resembling a cluster of large, hollow, spiked pods or shells. The ground is uneven, with scattered rocks and patches of grass, and a small body of water is visible in the foreground, reflecting light. The scene is illuminated by a warm, ambient light source, highlighting the textures of the stone and the organic structure."
