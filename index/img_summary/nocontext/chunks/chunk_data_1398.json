    "img_summary": "The image shows a video game interface focused on the \"Equipment\" section, specifically displaying the \"Jade Lotus Gourd,\" categorized as an epic item. This gourd recovers a considerable amount of health for nearby duplicates when used. It includes two enhancements: \"5-Year-Old Coconut Wine,\" which recovers 40% of maximum health per sip, with older wine providing greater recovery; and \"Celestial Lotus Seeds,\" which slowly recovers a small amount of health for a brief period after use. The gourd is currently equipped by the character, who is visible holding it on the right side of the image. The character's stats are listed on the right, including health, attack, and defense values. A quote at the bottom advises distributing virtues to avert envy and safeguard oneself."
