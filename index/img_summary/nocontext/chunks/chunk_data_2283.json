    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game showing the player's equipment menu. The player is at level 102 with various basic attributes listed, including Health, Mana, Stamina, Attack, and Defense. The selected equipment is a rare item called \"Verdant Glow,\" which has a high Qi cost. This item allows the player to take the form of a tree, absorbing nature's essence to continuously recover health, with enhanced effects when in water. The equipped effect slowly recovers a small amount of health. The menu also displays a list of spirits that can be equipped, and the option to sort them by acquisition order."
