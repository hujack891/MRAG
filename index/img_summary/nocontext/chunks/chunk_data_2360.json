    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where a character is exploring a dark cave environment. The character is holding a staff with a glowing red tip, suggesting it might be used as a weapon or a source of light. The cave is filled with rocky terrain and cobwebs, and there is a wooden structure in the background. An interface overlay is visible, displaying the character's health at 84, a resource called \"Will\" with a quantity of 109, and various icons indicating abilities or items. A red arrow points to a specific area on the left side of the image, possibly indicating a point of interest or a path to follow."
