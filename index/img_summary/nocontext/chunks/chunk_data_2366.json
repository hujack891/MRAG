The character is holding a glowing staff and appears to be heading towards a wooden structure and a lit brazier. The environment is a rugged, mountainous area with rocky cliffs. On the screen, there are various HUD elements, including health bars, ability icons, and a counter labeled \"Will\" with a value of 109. A small green glowing object is highlighted in the distance with a red dotted circle, suggesting it may be an interactive or collectible item."
