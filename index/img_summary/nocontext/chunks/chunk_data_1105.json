The player character is wielding a weapon and appears to be in motion, possibly dodging or attacking. The creature is mid-action, causing dust and debris to fly around it. The game's user interface is visible, showing health bars, various icons for abilities or items, and a map in the bottom corners. The environment is barren, with rocky terrain and sparse vegetation."
