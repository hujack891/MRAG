    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where a character, holding a staff with a glowing red tip, is standing on a wooden platform overlooking a rocky cavern. The character is illuminated by a light source, possibly a torch, attached to their back. A red arrow indicates a path or direction, and a red dashed circle highlights an object or point of interest below the platform. The game's user interface displays various icons and meters, including a health or stamina bar, in the bottom corners of the screen. The environment is dark and cave-like, with rocky textures and shadows."
