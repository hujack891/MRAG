    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game, showing a character with a torch standing in a lush, green environment. The character is wearing a cloak made of straw or grass. There are two red circles highlighting points of interest in the scene: one on the left near a structure with cobwebs and another on the right near a wooden cross-like structure. The interface displays various icons and a health or stamina bar at the bottom of the screen, suggesting the game involves exploration or combat elements. The setting is a mix of natural and man-made elements, with a mysterious and possibly ominous atmosphere."
