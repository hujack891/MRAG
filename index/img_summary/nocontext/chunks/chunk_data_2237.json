A character holding a long staff is crouched and moving toward a stone structure embedded in a rocky cliff, which features carved statues and pillars. The HUD displays various icons, including abilities or items, and a resource labeled \"Will\" with a value of 360. Health, stamina, and another bar are visible in the bottom-left corner. The setting is surrounded by trees and snow-covered terrain, with faint glowing lights near the structure."
