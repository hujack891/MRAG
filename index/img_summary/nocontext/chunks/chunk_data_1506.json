The player character is in the foreground, facing the Macaque Chief, who is positioned above and seems to be attacking. The health bar for the Macaque Chief is visible, indicating the boss's remaining health. The interface displays various icons and gauges, likely representing the player's abilities, items, or status effects. A text at the bottom reads, \"Well done. Thick skull you've got,\" possibly indicating dialogue or a taunt from the boss."
