    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where a player-controlled character, dressed in fur and holding a staff, is engaged in combat with two bird-like enemies in a snowy forest environment. The character is positioned in the foreground, facing the enemies, who are airborne and have a red health bar above them. The game interface displays various icons and a health bar at the bottom of the screen, indicating the player's status and available actions. A red arrow is drawn on the image, pointing towards the enemies, likely highlighting a point of interest or a suggested action in the game."
