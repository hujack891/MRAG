It displays a selection of \"Spirits\" available to the player, with one spirit named \"Beetle Captain\" highlighted. The Beetle Captain is classified as a rare spirit and has a moderate Qi cost. The description explains its ability, \"Airborne Sting,\" which allows the player to take the form of the Beetle Captain, soar into the air to evade attacks, and then dive down to attack upon landing. The equipped effect of this spirit moderately increases maximum stamina. The interface provides options to equip the spirit, watch a demo, and shows various stats on the right side, including health, stamina, and other attributes."
