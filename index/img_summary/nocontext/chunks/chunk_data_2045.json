    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character is engaged in combat with an enemy named \"Non-Void.\" The character is performing an attack, indicated by the glowing red weapon or effect. The enemy appears to be a ghostly or ethereal figure. The health bar for \"Non-Void\" is visible, showing that it is partially depleted. The text at the bottom of the screen reads, \"Yaoguai, meet your end!\" suggesting the character is addressing the enemy. Various icons are displayed on the left and right sides of the screen, likely representing abilities or items available to the player. The setting appears to be a dimly lit, indoor environment with a stone floor and red walls."
