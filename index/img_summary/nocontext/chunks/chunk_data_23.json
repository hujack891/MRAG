    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a cave with a rocky and earthy environment. A character holding a staff stands near another seated character, who appears to be a vendor or NPC (non-playable character) surrounded by barrels and jars. The seated character has a prompt above them indicating that the player can interact with them by pressing \"RT\" to talk. In the background, there is a large statue carved into the rock wall, partially illuminated by green glowing lights. The setting is dimly lit, with a torch providing some light on the right side of the image."
