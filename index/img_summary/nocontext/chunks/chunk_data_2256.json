    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy forest environment. A character, seen from behind, is holding a staff and facing a large, humanoid creature that is wielding a massive rock. The creature has a distinctive circular shield-like object on its back. The user interface displays various icons and meters, including a health bar, a stamina bar, and an item labeled \"Will\" with a quantity of 25. The game appears to involve combat or strategy elements, as suggested by the character's stance and the presence of the creature."
