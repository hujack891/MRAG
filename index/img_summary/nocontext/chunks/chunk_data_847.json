    "img_summary": "The image displays a video game interface focusing on the \"Equipment\" section, specifically the \"Spirits\" category. The highlighted spirit is \"Falcon Hermit,\" classified as rare with a high Qi cost. Its ability, \"Frosty Wind,\" allows the player to summon a gust of wind that deals frost damage multiple times along its path or freezes enemies with repeated hits. The equipped effect moderately increases frost damage. The player can activate this ability in combat by pressing the \"F\" key. The interface also shows various other spirits available for selection, along with the player's stats such as health, attack, defense, and elemental attributes."
