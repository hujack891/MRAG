The highlighted item is the \"Jade Lotus Pill,\" described as a lesser celestial medicine that permanently and moderately increases Maximum Health. The player has not made any of these pills yet, and the crafting requires 540 Will and one Mind Core, which costs 3 units (with 8 available). On the right side, the current character stats are shown, including Maximum Health, Mana, Stamina, Defense, Stamina Recovery Rate, and various resistances. The Jade Lotus Pill will increase Maximum Health by 15 points. The character is standing in a dimly lit environment, wearing detailed armor and holding a staff."
