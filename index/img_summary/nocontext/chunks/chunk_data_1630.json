    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game set in a snowy, mountainous landscape. The player character, dressed in a fur cloak and wielding a spear, is crouched in the snow, seemingly preparing for a stealthy approach. In the background, there are two humanoid enemies, one of whom is highlighted with a red health bar, indicating they are a target. A large, turtle-like creature is visible on the right side of the image. The game interface displays various icons and a status bar at the bottom, with the word \"Will\" and a count of eight, suggesting a resource or ability available to the player."
