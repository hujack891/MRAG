    "img_summary": "The image displays a section of a video game interface focused on equipment and character attributes. The player is viewing the \"Snake Sheriff,\" a rare spirit with a low Qi cost. The spirit's ability, \"Tiger Roar,\" allows the player to take the form of the Snake Sheriff, extending its neck to roar skyward and shake nearby yaoguais with a powerful voice. In combat, the ability is activated by pressing \"F.\" The equipped effect of the Snake Sheriff moderately increases the player's attack but considerably reduces defense. The player's current level is 102, with various basic attributes such as health, mana, stamina, attack, and defense listed on the right side. Additionally, the player's resistance to different banes like chill, burn, poison, and shock are shown, along with their respective values. The interface includes options for self-advance, relics, inventory, journal, and settings."
