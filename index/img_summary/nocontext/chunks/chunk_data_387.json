Two rare items are highlighted: the \"Back Scratcher,\" which considerably increases maximum stamina, and the \"Cat Eye Beads,\" which slightly increases critical hit chance and is currently equipped. The player's stats are shown on the right, including health, stamina, attack, defense, and various percentages. The menu allows sorting by default and provides options to remove, view details, examine, or return. A quote at the bottom reads, \"Cast not rare and precious things before avaricious eyes.\""
