The highlighted item is \"Serpentscale Bracers,\" classified as \"Uncommon.\" These bracers provide 7 defense and 3 poison resistance. They also have a special ability called \"Wave-Rider,\" which massively reduces stamina cost when in water. The crafting requirements include 25 Yarn and 1732 Will, with the player having 720 Will available. The player can hold the \"A\" button to craft the item. On the right side, there is a character with a mask and armor, along with various stats displayed. A dialogue at the bottom reads, \"I recognize you. You're no noble.\""
