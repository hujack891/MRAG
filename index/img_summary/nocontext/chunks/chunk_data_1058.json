    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, atmospheric scene from a video game, featuring a large, imposing statue of a muscular figure with an intense expression and raised arms. The statue is situated behind a wooden fence, and the area is dimly lit, creating a mysterious and foreboding ambiance. In the foreground, a character is seen running towards the statue, holding a long weapon. A red dashed circle highlights a glowing object on a table in front of the statue, suggesting it may be an important item or objective in the game. The setting appears to be an ancient or mystical temple, with wooden pillars and intricate carvings."
