    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a dense forest environment with bamboo trees, moss-covered rocks, and overgrown vegetation. A character, seen from behind, crouches while holding a staff, suggesting a stealthy approach. In the distance, another figure is interacting with a table or altar surrounded by lit candles. Stone lanterns flank the pathway leading to the altar. The user interface displays icons for abilities or items on the left, a health bar at the bottom, and a crouching silhouette on the right, indicating the player's current stance."
