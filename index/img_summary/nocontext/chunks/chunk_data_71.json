The upgraded effect increases the number of times the gourd can be used. The screen also features a character holding a gourd, surrounded by glowing particles. Instructions at the bottom suggest the need for a suitable gourd to drink from, with a promise to fetch one. The options \"Examine,\" \"Sorting,\" and \"Return\" are available for interaction."
