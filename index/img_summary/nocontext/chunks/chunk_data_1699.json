The player character is on the ground, holding a weapon, and appears to be in a challenging situation as indicated by the dialogue at the bottom of the screen: \"You are at the end of your wits, with no one to turn to. Why persist with this farce?\" Various game interface elements are visible, including health bars, icons for abilities or items, and controls."
