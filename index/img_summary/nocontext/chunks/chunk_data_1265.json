    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a dark, cave-like environment. A character, seen from behind, is standing on a rocky path. The area is dimly lit, with a warm glow emanating from a small fire or light source on the left side, illuminating a stone structure and some pottery. The scene includes twisted, vine-like structures and dense foliage, contributing to the mysterious and atmospheric setting. An arrow is pointing towards the illuminated area, possibly indicating a point of interest or a direction to follow."
