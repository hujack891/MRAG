Two items are highlighted: \"Cat Eye Beads,\" which slightly increase the player's critical hit chance, and \"Glazed Reliquary,\" which recovers a small amount of stamina when the player performs a perfect dodge. The player's current stats are shown on the right side, including health, stamina, attack power, and critical hit chance. The interface also shows the player's currency total, which is 35,286, and a quote about embracing destiny and mastering the heart."
