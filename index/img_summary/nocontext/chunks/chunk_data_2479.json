    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a dark, cavernous environment. A character, wearing a cloak made of fur or grass, stands on a wooden platform holding a spear-like weapon. The character is looking down towards a dimly lit area with a glowing fire and a small shrine-like structure. The surroundings are rocky and covered in webs, suggesting a cave or dungeon setting. In the distance, there are large egg-like structures and a figure illuminated by a torch. The game's interface is visible, showing health and stamina bars, along with various icons indicating abilities or items on the left and right sides of the screen."
