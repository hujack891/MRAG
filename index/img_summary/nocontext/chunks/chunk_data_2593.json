    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character is engaged in combat with an enemy named \"Yellow Wind Sage.\" The enemy is engulfed in flames and appears to be wielding a weapon. On the left side of the image, there are instructions for two types of attacks: \"Light Attack 'Moon Dance'\" which involves continuously slashing at the enemy to build up Focus, and \"Heavy Attack 'Moon Chase'\" which unleashes a series of dash attacks. At the bottom of the image, there is a health bar indicating the status of the \"Yellow Wind Sage.\" The environment appears to be a sandy or dusty terrain."
