    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character is standing in a dimly lit cave or dungeon environment. The character is facing a stone altar or table with two lit candles and a glowing object on it. A prompt on the screen indicates the option to \"Open\" the object, suggesting it might be a chest or container. The surroundings include rocky walls and wooden structures, with skulls mounted on a wooden frame to the right. The lighting creates a dramatic contrast between the shadows and the illuminated area."
