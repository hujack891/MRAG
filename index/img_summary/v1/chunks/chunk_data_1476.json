    "img_summary": "The image shows a weapon crafting menu from a video game, focusing on the \"Loongwreathe Staff,\" an Epic weapon with an attack value of 70. The staff has a unique effect that moderately increases damage dealt by all Pillar Stance moves. The UI displays the player's current resources, including 20,567 of a currency or resource, and various character stats such as health (390), attack (220), and defense (300). The crafting requirements for the staff include Thunderbone, Refined Iron Sand, and Will, but the player currently has insufficient materials. The background features a character holding the staff, and a quote is partially visible at the bottom."
