You'll find him just inside the Warding Temple, harassing the Wise Master until you intervene.\nAfter a second defeat, you'll face him one last time near the end of the chapter, in-between two bouts that you'll have with the end boss, Yellowbrow.\n* First Encounter\n* Second Encounter\n* Final Encounter\n### Second Encounter - Warding Temple\n\nFinally, if you spend to much time dishing out damage to his face, he'll eventually counter with an unexpected move: puking on you.
