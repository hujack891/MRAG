    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character, wielding a fiery staff, is navigating a rocky, forested environment. The character is positioned in a crouched stance, suggesting readiness or stealth. A red dashed circle highlights an object or point of interest in the distance, indicating a potential target or objective. The user interface includes several elements: a health bar at the bottom left, various ability icons with corresponding button prompts (R1, R2, L1, L2) on the right side, and a circular gauge or meter at the bottom right. These UI components suggest the player has access to multiple abilities or items that can be activated during gameplay."
