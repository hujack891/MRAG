    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a player character, resembling a monkey or primate warrior, is engaged in combat with a large, armored enemy wielding a weapon. The setting is a snowy, mountainous environment, adding a challenging terrain element to the fight. The UI displays various icons and meters: the bottom left shows a health bar and possibly stamina or magic bars, while the bottom right features ability icons with button prompts (RT, LT, etc.), suggesting special moves or powers. The enemy's health bar is visible above its head, indicating it is partially depleted, which is crucial for tracking combat progress. The player character appears to be in an attacking stance, possibly using a special ability, as indicated by the glowing effect around the character's hand."
