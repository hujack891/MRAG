    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a rocky, desert-like environment. A creature is visible in the center, appearing to be in motion, possibly executing an attack. The user interface displays two attack options on the left side: \"Light Attack 'Earth Shatter'\" and \"Heavy Attack 'Mountain Splitter',\" with descriptions for each. The light attack involves striking the enemy three times with a heavy head, while the heavy attack involves a forceful dash forward, which can be fully charged for extended range. At the bottom left, a health bar is present, indicating the player's current health status. On the bottom right, there are icons, possibly representing abilities or items, alongside a circular map or radar."
