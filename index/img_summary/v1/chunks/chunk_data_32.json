A creature resembling a large, muscular humanoid is visible, partially obscured by dust and debris, suggesting movement or impact. On the left side of the image, text describes two attack options: \"Light Attack 'Earth Shatter'\" which involves striking the enemy three times with a heavy head, and \"Heavy Attack 'Mountain Splitter'\" which involves dashing forward with full force, with the ability to charge fully for a further dash. A health bar is displayed at the bottom, indicating the player's status."
