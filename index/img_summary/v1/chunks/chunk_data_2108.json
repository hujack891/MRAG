This image corresponds to the second round of the Yellowbrow boss fight, highlighting the challenging nature of the encounter, where Yellowbrow uses electricity to stun and damage the player. The visual emphasizes the need for strategic evasion and healing due to the significant health loss caused by Yellowbrow's attacks."
