A red dashed circle highlights a Flamling creature, and a red arrow points towards the right, indicating the direction to explore. The image serves to visually guide players on where to find Flamlings, which drop important Flame Ores needed for a secret boss later in the game. The context emphasizes the importance of dealing with these creatures to avoid their ranged fire attacks while exploring the area."
