    "img_summary": "The image displays the equipment menu from a video game, showcasing the \"Fireproof Mantle,\" a legendary item. This mantle has a high Qi cost and provides burn immunity and gradually increasing focus, making it effective in specific environments and against certain enemies. The equipped effect significantly increases burn resistance and grants immunity to scorch damage from lava-covered terrain. The UI includes options for self-advance, inventory, journal, and settings. The player's stats are visible on the right, including health, attack, defense, and various resistances. The mantle is currently equipped, and there is an option to watch a demo of its use.
