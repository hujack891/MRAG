    "img_summary": "### Summary of the Image\n\nThe image depicts a dramatic battle scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, specifically within the \"Rhino Watch Slope\" area of Chapter 6, as outlined in the *Foothills Walkthrough*. The central focus is the Yaoguai Chief, the \"Gold Armored Rhino,\" a massive, armored creature with vibrant gold and blue hues, surrounded by smaller enemies and environmental details such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The foreground features a character wielding a staff, likely engaging in combat with the Rhino, while other figures appear to be mid-action, possibly allies or additional foes. This visual complements the preceding text, which provides strategic advice on building focus and using abilities like \"Immobilize\" to defeat the Rhino effectively. The image serves to illustrate the intensity and scale of this boss encounter."
