    "img_summary": "The image shows the \"Equipment\" menu from a video game, specifically highlighting the \"Fungiman\" spirit. It is classified as a \"Rare\" spirit with a high Qi cost. The Fungiman's ability, \"Whirl,\" allows the player to take its form and wield a spinning staff to charge at enemies and nearby yaoguais. The equipped effect moderately increases the recovery speed of Might. The UI includes various spirits on the left, player stats on the right (such as health, energy, and defense), and options to equip, watch a demo, or return to other menus."
