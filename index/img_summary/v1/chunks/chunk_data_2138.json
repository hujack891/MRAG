You'll find him by heading down the hill from the main road in the Forest of Felicity and into the Brook of Bliss, and then cross the bridge and head up the hill past the Shrine.\n### Non-Able Miniboss Fight and Guide\nDon't mistake his subdued appearance for weakness, Non-Able is probably one of the toughest Yaoguai Chief bosses you'll face in Chapter 3. Unlike other enemies, he won't use any magic or ranged tricks on you, and trades it all in for overwhelming power and a mastery of martial arts that makes him an extremely challenging foe -- and that's before the restraints come off.\nIf you haven't made use of them in other fights, now is definitely the time to take advantage of all the medicinal pills and consumable buffs you can craft and use. Items like the Tiger Subduing Pellets to raise your attack and others that can raise your stamina or focus can all help out greatly, and you'll want every advantage on your side.\n\nBe sure to experiment using your spells to their fullest. Rock Solid can sometimes knock him back, but often will send you skidding back instead, making Cloud Step a great alternative. We also found Red Tides to be a great transformation spell to keep up with dodging his rapid attacks, though you can also soak the blows with Azure Dust, but you won't be able to land many hits.",
