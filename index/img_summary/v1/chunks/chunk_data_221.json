    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy, mountainous environment with a stone bridge in the foreground and large, detailed rock carvings of human figures in the background. A character is seen standing on the bridge, and there is a text hint at the bottom of the screen that reads, \"Throwing a tantrum at this age? Shame on you!\" This suggests a narrative or dialogue element relevant to the gameplay. The setting appears to be a significant location, possibly a temple or sacred site, given the intricate carvings and the atmospheric conditions."
