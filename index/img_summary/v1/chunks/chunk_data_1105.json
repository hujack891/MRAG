The player character, seen in the foreground, is engaged in combat with a large, formidable enemy called \"Stone Vanguard,\" as indicated by the text and health bar at the bottom of the screen. The enemy appears to be a massive, stone-like creature, creating a cloud of dust as it moves. The user interface includes various icons on the left and right sides, suggesting abilities or items that the player can use, with buttons labeled for activation (e.g., LB, RT). The health bar at the bottom left shows the player's current health status, while a mini-map is visible on the bottom right, providing navigation assistance.
