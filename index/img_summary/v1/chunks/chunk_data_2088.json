    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character, equipped with a staff, stands in front of a stone statue in a dimly lit, ancient environment. The character is dressed in armor, suggesting readiness for combat or exploration. The user interface displays several elements: a health bar at the bottom left, indicating the player's current health status, and various icons on both sides of the screen. The left side icons appear to be related to inventory or abilities, while the right side icons might represent skills or actions, with button prompts for activation. The environment is rugged, with stone walls and overgrown grass, enhancing the atmosphere of an abandoned or historical site. The statue may serve as a point of interest or interaction within the game."
