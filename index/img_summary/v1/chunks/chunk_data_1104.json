It shows a player character, likely the Destined One, standing in a shallow body of water, facing a large, menacing creature known as the Yaoguai Chief - Jiao-Loong of Waves. The surrounding environment features dense forest and towering cliffs, contributing to the tense atmosphere. This encounter is part of the \"Verdant Path\" section of the walkthrough, where players are guided on how to deal with this boss, particularly noting its behavior when its health is reduced."
