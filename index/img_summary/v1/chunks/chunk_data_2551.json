    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene from a video game, featuring two characters engaged in battle. The character on the left appears to be the player character, equipped with armor and wielding a weapon, possibly a sword or staff. The character on the right is an enemy, distinguishable by its large size, red attire, and a visible health bar above its head. The environment is a rocky, outdoor setting with stone steps and debris scattered around. The user interface includes several elements: on the bottom left, there are icons likely representing items or abilities; a health bar with a white and blue gauge; and on the bottom right, more icons indicating different abilities or actions, with button prompts labeled RT and LT. The circular gauge with a figure suggests a special ability or energy meter. The scene emphasizes strategic combat, requiring the player to manage health and abilities effectively."
