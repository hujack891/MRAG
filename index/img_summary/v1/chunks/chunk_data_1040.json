The enemy is performing a fiery attack, creating a circle of flames around them. The setting is a lush, forested area with green foliage visible on the ground. The game's interface shows Guangzhi's health bar at the bottom center, which is partially depleted, indicating damage taken. On the left side of the screen, there are icons representing abilities or items, with numerical values next to them. The overall atmosphere suggests an intense battle sequence."
