    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy forest environment. A character is engaged in combat, wielding a staff that emits red and blue energy effects. The character appears to be casting a spell or using a special ability, as indicated by the swirling energy around them. The user interface displays various elements: on the bottom left, there are icons for different abilities or items, along with health and stamina bars. The health bar is partially depleted, suggesting the character has taken damage. On the bottom right, additional icons and a circular meter may represent abilities or cooldowns. Text at the bottom of the screen reads \"I'll get rid of all evil!\" indicating the character's intent or motivation. The name \"Non-Able\" appears above a progress bar, possibly indicating the enemy's status or a quest objective."
