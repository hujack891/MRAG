    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character is engaged in combat within a dimly lit, ancient temple-like environment. The player character is casting or using an ability, as indicated by the glowing, swirling energy emanating from their hand. A ghostly, translucent enemy figure is visible in the background, suggesting an encounter with a spectral opponent. The user interface displays various elements: a health bar at the bottom center labeled \"Non-Void,\" indicating the player's current health status, and ability icons on the bottom left and right corners, which likely represent available skills or items. The presence of button prompts (e.g., LB, RT) suggests controller inputs for activating these abilities."
