    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character navigating through a dense, overgrown forest area, likely part of a video game environment. The character is seen running towards a rocky path with a broken shrine structure in the background. The in-game interface shows an item collection notification for \"Aged Ginseng x2.\" This scene is situated in the \"Outside the Forest\" section of the document titled \"The Forest of Wolves.\" The preceding text suggests that the character is preparing to face upcoming challenges after leaving the Shrine, with a warning from the Keeper about the dangers ahead. The image serves to illustrate the environment and the initial steps of exploration in this new area."
