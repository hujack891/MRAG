    "img_summary": "The image displays an equipment screen from a video game, focusing on a weapon called the \"Willow Wood Staff.\" The staff is categorized as a common item with an attack power of 30. The screen includes various UI components such as tabs for Self-Advance, Equipment, Inventory, Journal, and Settings. In the top right corner, there are indicators for currency or points, showing values of 56 and 0. The right side lists character stats: health (300), stamina (200), mana (200), attack (30), defense (10), agility (50), and several percentages, including critical hit chance (150%). Below the weapon description, a quote provides insight into the staff's effectiveness, suggesting it is strong enough for combat but not overwhelmingly powerful. The options to examine, view details, or return are available at the bottom of the screen."
