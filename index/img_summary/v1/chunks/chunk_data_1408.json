    "img_summary": "The image depicts a gameplay scene set in a snowy, mountainous environment. A large, dragon-like creature named \"Kang Jin Loong\" is engaged in combat with the player character, who is visible on the icy ground. The creature is emitting icy effects, suggesting an attack or defensive move. The user interface includes several elements: a health bar for \"Kang Jin Loong\" at the bottom, indicating the enemy's current health status, and various icons on the left and right sides of the screen, likely representing abilities or items available to the player. The bottom left shows the player's health and stamina bars. The snowy landscape and icy surface suggest potential challenges related to movement and visibility during the battle."
