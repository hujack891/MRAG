    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game set in a rocky, cave-like environment. A character is visible in the center, wielding a staff with glowing red ends, suggesting it may be a weapon or tool. The character is moving towards a wooden structure and a lit brazier, which could serve as a checkpoint or a source of light. In the background, there is a glowing object circled in red, possibly indicating an item or objective to be collected or interacted with. The user interface displays several elements: a health bar at the top right, labeled with \"+105\" and \"85,\" and a resource labeled \"Will\" with a count of \"x109.\" At the bottom left, there are icons representing abilities or items, each with a number, likely indicating quantity or level. These UI components are crucial for managing the character's health, resources, and abilities during gameplay."
