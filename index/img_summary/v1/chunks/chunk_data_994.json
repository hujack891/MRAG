    "img_summary": "The image depicts a large, imposing creature resembling a tree or rock golem, with glowing blue-green energy emanating from its body. This creature stands in a lush, forested environment under a cloudy sky. The energy appears to be crackling and extending from the creature, suggesting it is either charging up or releasing power. In the foreground, a smaller figure, possibly a player character, is facing the creature, indicating a potential confrontation or battle scenario. The scene is devoid of any visible UI elements, health bars, or text hints, focusing solely on the dramatic encounter between the character and the creature in the natural setting."
