Though the boss has two phases, you may not have as much trouble as you did with The Scorpionlord, since you won't have to deal with poison, and their attacks are a bit easier to read and counter. Strangely enough, it also starts the fight at around 75% of its health, but it does have a second health bar waiting, so pacing yourself can be the key to this fight.\n\nHe will immediately follow this by taking to the air, and launching a string of projectiles that arc across the air to hit you in salvos. If you're already low on stamina from deflecting the first attack, you're better off running to the side to avoid them.\n\nThe good news is that his loud crow leaves enough time for you to interrupt the attack entirely by hitting him with a charged attack or Spirit Attack, cancelling the move entirely.\n\nOnce you know where and when his sword will appear, the rest of the fight will come down to waiting for openings after his big attack to hit him hard, using your Spirit Attacks and Transformation Spells in this phase to speed things up. With all of his attacks being fairly visible to spot coming, it shouldn't take too long to get the hang of and send this demon rooster to the abyss.\n\nThe Duskveil",
