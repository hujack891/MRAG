To find Yellow Loong, you'll need to wait until Chapter 4. As you make your way through the Webbed Hollow, you'll start to work toward the bottom of the area, past the Cliff of Oblivion. This is where you can find the Relief of the Fallen Loong, with the boss battle taking place nearby.\n\nDefeating him will reward you with a powerful Transformation Spell called Golden Lining, where you can become Yellow Loong and use his shock-infused long combo attacks.",

This setting is likely part of the Webbed Hollow area mentioned in Chapter 4 of the document \"Secrets in Black Myth Wukong.\" The altars and surroundings suggest a significant location where players might encounter the Yellow Loong boss and obtain the Golden Lining Transformation Spell. The image serves to visually represent the atmospheric and mysterious environment players will navigate to reach this pivotal point in the game."
