The player character is performing attacks, with visual effects showing red energy or blood around the enemy, suggesting damage being dealt. On the left side of the screen, there are instructions for two types of attacks: \"Light Attack 'Earth Shatter'\" and \"Heavy Attack 'Mountain Splitter,'\" detailing their actions and effects.
