Set in the rugged, dark terrain of the Ashen Pass III area in *Black Myth: Wukong*, the scene visually aligns with the preceding text, which describes the boss emerging to attack when the player attempts to harvest a mushroom. The image serves to illustrate the intensity and scale of the boss fight, providing visual context for the walkthrough's description of this challenging encounter."
