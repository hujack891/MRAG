    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game, showing a menu related to \"Relics.\" The highlighted relic is \"Craving Eyes,\" which provides a glimpse of the foes' might and identifies yaoguais that bear Spirits. The relic grants three abilities: \"Opportune Watcher,\" which increases Focus gained from consecutive successful Light Attack hits; \"Eagle Eye,\" which reduces the cooldown of the spell \"Unveiling Strike\" upon a successful hit; and \"Keen Insight,\" which increases Critical Hit Damage. The screen also displays a bird perched on a branch, with options to confirm, examine, or return at the bottom."
