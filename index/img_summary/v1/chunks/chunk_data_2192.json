    "img_summary": "The image displays a section of a video game interface focused on \"Relics,\" specifically highlighting the \"Craving Eyes\" relic. This relic provides the ability to identify enemies known as yaoguais that bear spirits, giving players an advantage in combat. The interface shows three abilities associated with the relic: \"Opportune Watcher,\" which increases Focus from consecutive Light Attack hits; \"Eagle Eye,\" which reduces the cooldown of the Unveiling Strike spell after a successful hit; and \"Keen Insight,\" which boosts critical hit damage. The UI includes navigation options such as \"Self-Advance,\" \"Equipment,\" \"Inventory,\" \"Journal,\" and \"Settings,\" with button prompts for confirming, examining, and returning actions. A detailed illustration of a bird-like creature is visible, possibly representing the relic or its associated spirit."
