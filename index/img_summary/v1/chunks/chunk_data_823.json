    "img_summary": "The image displays the equipment menu from a video game, focusing on a spirit named \"Elder Amourworm,\" classified as Epic with a high Qi cost. The spirit's ability, \"Foul Spray,\" allows the player to take the form of the Elder Amourworm and spray venom to create poisonous pools on the ground, applying Poison Bane to enemies that step on them. In combat, this ability can be activated by pressing 'F'. The equipped effect slightly increases the player's critical hit chance when in a poisoned state. The menu shows various spirits available for selection, each represented by an icon. On the right side, player stats are visible, including health, stamina, and other attributes, with some values highlighted in green or red indicating changes. The top right corner displays currency and a count of a specific item or resource."
