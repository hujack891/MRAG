A character, possibly the protagonist, is engaged in a battle with a Red-Haired Yaksha, as suggested by the preceding text. Sparks and visual effects indicate an intense fight, with the character's health and abilities displayed on the screen. This scene illustrates the player's encounter with an enemy, emphasizing the strategy of isolating the Yaksha from other foes for a one-on-one confrontation."
