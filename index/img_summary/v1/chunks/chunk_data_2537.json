This scene is likely related to the narrative in Chapter 4 of \"Secrets in Black Myth Wukong,\" specifically within the \"Skandha of Choice\" section. The preceding text mentions a fox guai's soul and a quest for revenge at the New Thunderclap Temple, suggesting that this cave might be a significant location in the journey, possibly where the fox guai's soul is found or where a crucial event in the quest takes place."
