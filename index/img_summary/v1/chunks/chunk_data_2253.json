    "img_summary": "The image from the document titled \"The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm\" shows a dark, rocky corridor in the Lower Pagoda (Level 2). A character, likely the player, is engaged in combat with a Frozen Corpse near a small fire. The scene is illuminated by the fire and the sparks from the combat. This image aligns with the preceding text, which describes the player needing to clear out an archer and a Frozen Corpse after crossing a wooden beam, before moving through a darkened hall filled with potential ambushes. The image visually represents this challenging section of the walkthrough, emphasizing the hostile environment and the combat encounters the player must navigate."
