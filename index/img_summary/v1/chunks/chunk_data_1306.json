    "img_summary": "The image shows a character standing in shallow water, holding a long staff. The character is facing a large, dark structure resembling a temple or shrine, partially obscured by shadows. There are two lit torches on either side of the entrance to the structure. The environment is lush and overgrown, with large rocks and statues of seated figures visible in the background. A red arrow points towards a dark opening in the rocky cliffside on the left, suggesting a path or entrance."
