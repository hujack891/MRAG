You must defeat this boss in order to free a friend from two giant cymbals embedded in the peak above Turtle Rock\n* **Rewards:** Loong Pearl, Mind Core\n## Where to Find Kang-Jin Star\nKang-Jin Star is a formidable and umissable boss you'll need to defeat to free Zhu Bajie from being imprisoned in a giant pair of cymbls. You can reach this boss by making your way through the Pagoda Realm and through the Temple of Warding and out the back to a large slope you can slide down onto Turtle Island.\n### Kang-Jin Star Boss Fight and Guide\nLike the other Kang-Jin, expect this fight to involve a heaping helping of electricity, and stock up accordingly on Shock-Quelling medicine, or you'll be taking a lot of damage. Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.\n\nOften after proclaiming \"Tremors forge thunder\" she can create electrical spots on the ground to erupt with lightning after a moment. The problem is these rings will follow you for a moment before she enacts the strike, so again you'll need to watch when she crackles with light to know the strike is coming and dodge it. At the start of the fight you'll only have to dodge one, but over time she'll do more and more of these for the first part of her attack.\n\nShe'll often follow up these strikes by finishing her sentence with \"clashes form bolts\" and then toss a projectile straight at you from her hand, requiring a second dodge before can get close and retaliate.",
