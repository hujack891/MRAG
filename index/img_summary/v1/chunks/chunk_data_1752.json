    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character, likely controlled by the player, is engaged in combat with an enemy. The environment is a rocky, snow-covered area with a cobblestone floor. The player character is wielding a weapon and appears to be in a combat stance, facing an enemy that is partially obscured by a green aura or effect. The user interface (UI) includes a health bar at the bottom center labeled \"Non-White,\" suggesting a boss or significant enemy encounter. Additional UI elements show various icons and meters, possibly indicating abilities or resources, on the bottom left and right corners. The presence of button prompts (e.g., LB, RT) suggests this is a console game."
