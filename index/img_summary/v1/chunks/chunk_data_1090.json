Still, you should try to be as aggressive as you can while you have Bajie helping you in the first part of the fight. As always, try to reserve any Gourd usage while you have Bajie, as he'll often top up your health.\n\nBesides the projectiles and using its wings to attack, the Supreme Inspector also uses a sword.
