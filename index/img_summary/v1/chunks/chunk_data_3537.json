This visual likely corresponds to the side quest initiated by the Pale-Axe Stalwart after his defeat, where he tasks the player with destroying the five element carts. The setting aligns with the walkthrough's description of Ashen Pass I, emphasizing the eerie and foreboding atmosphere of the game environment."
