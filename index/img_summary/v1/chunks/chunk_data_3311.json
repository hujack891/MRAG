It shows the player character standing in a dark, rocky environment, likely exploring the lower portion of the cave system. A glowing object, marked with a red circle, is visible in the distance, suggesting an important item or point of interest. This moment follows the defeat of Buddha's Right Hand and marks progression into the final area of the Webbed Hollow, as part of the Chapter 4 walkthrough."
