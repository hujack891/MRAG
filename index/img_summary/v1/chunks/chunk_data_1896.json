    "img_summary": "The image displays an equipment menu from a video game, focusing on a \"Rat Archer\" spirit. The spirit is categorized as rare and has a high Qi cost. Its ability, \"Mighty Release,\" allows the player to take the form of a Rat Archer, enabling them to load and shoot arrows multiple times in succession, dealing repeated damage. The player can activate this ability in combat by pressing the \"F\" key. An equipped effect is noted, which moderately reduces the stamina cost for a staff spin. The menu also shows various spirits available for selection, each with distinct appearances. On the right side, player stats like health, attack, defense, and others are displayed, alongside the player's current Qi and spirit count. The interface includes options for self-advancement, relics, inventory, journal, and settings."
