    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a player character is engaged in combat with a floating, humanoid enemy in a dark, web-covered environment. The enemy has a visible health bar above its head, indicating its current health status. The player character is wielding a weapon and appears to be in an attacking stance. The user interface (UI) includes several elements: a health and stamina bar at the bottom left, and various ability icons with cooldown indicators at the bottom center and right. The environment is dimly lit with some areas illuminated by small fires, adding to the eerie atmosphere. The presence of webbing and a large insect-like creature in the background suggests a theme of infestation or decay."
