    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy forest environment. The player character, equipped with a large staff and dressed in heavy, camouflaged clothing, is seen from behind. They are approaching an enemy standing on a rock ledge ahead, indicated by a red health bar above the enemy's head. The user interface displays various elements: in the bottom left corner, there are icons for different abilities or items; in the bottom center, a health bar and stamina bar; and in the bottom right corner, additional icons for abilities or items, with button prompts for RT and LT. The top right corner shows the player's current resource count labeled \"Will\" with a quantity of 67. The overall scene suggests an imminent combat encounter in a challenging, wintry landscape."
