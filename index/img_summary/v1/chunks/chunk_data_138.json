    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense combat scene from a video game set in a snowy environment. A character is performing a powerful attack, as indicated by the bright, electric-like visual effects emanating from their weapon. The UI elements include a health and stamina bar at the bottom left, with the health bar showing a low level, suggesting the character is in a critical state. The bottom center displays ability icons, and the bottom right corner shows a mini-map with directional indicators. The text \"Kang Jin Star\" appears above a health bar, likely indicating the enemy's name and health status. The word \"Spin\" is displayed at the bottom, possibly a command or ability being executed."
