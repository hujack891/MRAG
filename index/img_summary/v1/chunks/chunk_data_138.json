    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game showing an intense combat scene in a snowy environment. A character is performing a powerful attack, emitting bright blue and white energy beams, with sparks flying around. The action takes place near a rocky area with a barren tree in the background. The interface displays various icons on both sides of the screen, likely representing abilities or items, and a health bar at the bottom labeled \"Kang Jin Star.\" The word \"Spin\" is visible, possibly indicating the name of the attack or action being executed."
