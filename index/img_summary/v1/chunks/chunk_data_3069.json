    "img_summary": "### Summary of the Image:\n\nThe image depicts a snowy, forested area with a character navigating through the terrain, holding a long staff. A red arrow overlays the scene, pointing toward a path leading uphill, suggesting the next direction to proceed. The environment includes rocks, sparse vegetation, and a stream, emphasizing the icy and challenging conditions. HUD elements indicate the player's stats and inventory, with \"Will\" being highlighted as a collectible resource.\n\n### Narrative Role:\n\nThis image serves as a visual guide within the \"Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\" section of the *Valley of Ecstasy Walkthrough*. It likely illustrates the path players should take after defeating the frog miniboss, Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang, to continue exploring the area toward the Towers of Karma or other objectives. The snowy setting aligns with the preceding text's description of the boss's frost-based attacks and the need for body-warming items."
