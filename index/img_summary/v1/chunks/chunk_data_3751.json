With multiple entrances and exits to this area, we’ll start with the first Shrine on the other side of the Crouching Tiger Temple.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Yellow Wind Sage\nThe final boss of Chapter 2 is a hulking rat who holds an incredible trident spear in one hand, while the other carries… a giant head? If you think this may limit his moves, you’re unfortunately in for a rude awakening. The Yellow Wind Sage has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, and is not only a deadly attacker, but a master of the Samadhi Winds — but more on that later.\nMake sure you're suitably prepared for the fight in the best ways possible: Craft a bunch of medicine to increase your damage absorption and max health, and allocate any Mind Cores you’ve found toward Celestial Medicine buffs. You should also have a full set of either the Galeguard or Insect armor fully crafted, as well as the Cloud-Patterened Stone Staff from defeating the optional Sihandang boss. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you’ve beaten the Chapter 2 Secret Boss and equipped the new Vessel, the Wind Tamer.\n\nIf you see the spear tip glow behind the Yellow Wind Sage’s back, be ready for him to sweep the weapon out and then slam the trident down for another of his erupting sand spear attacks in a line.",
