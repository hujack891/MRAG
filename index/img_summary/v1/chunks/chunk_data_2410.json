    "img_summary": "The image depicts a moment from the boss fight against Red Boy in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The scene shows the player character facing Red Boy in a fiery battlefield, emphasizing the intense and flame-filled nature of the encounter. Red Boy appears to be wielding a staff, surrounded by flames, which aligns with the preceding text describing his use of fire-based attacks and his ability to create a ring of fire during combat. This visual likely illustrates the challenging environment and mechanics players must navigate during this fight."
