    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a rocky, forested environment. A character in elaborate armor wielding a glowing staff is engaged in combat with a large, winged enemy. The enemy appears to be a griffin or similar creature, adorned with gold armor. There are three red, glowing orbs on the ground, possibly indicating some form of attack or trap. The scene is dark and atmospheric, with detailed textures on the ground and surrounding cliffs. The visual elements suggest a high-stakes battle, with the character likely needing to avoid the red orbs while attacking the winged enemy."
