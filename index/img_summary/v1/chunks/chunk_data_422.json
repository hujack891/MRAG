The user interface includes a health bar for both the player and the boss at the bottom of the screen, with the player's health bar showing some depletion. On the left, there are several icons indicating available abilities or items, and on the right, additional icons likely representing special moves or powers. The player character appears to be wielding a weapon, possibly a sword, as they engage in combat with the boss."
