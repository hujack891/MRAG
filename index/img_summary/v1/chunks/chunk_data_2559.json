A character, possibly the protagonist, stands in front of the shrine, suggesting a moment of reverence or a significant event in the narrative. This scene is likely part of the \"Non-Void\" section in Chapter 3 of the document titled \"Secret Bosses in Chapter 3.\" The shrine may be related to the questline involving Chen Loong, where players collect a tonic and are transported to Zodiac Village to challenge the Yin Tiger, earning rewards such as an additional Curio slot and the ability to craft tough armor."
