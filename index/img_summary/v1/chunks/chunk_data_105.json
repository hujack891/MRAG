    "img_summary": "The image displays an equipment menu from a video game, focusing on a spirit called \"Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang,\" categorized as Epic. The spirit has a high Qi cost and features a \"Tongue Whip\" ability, which allows the player to attack foes from a distance using a tongue. The ability is noted for inflicting significant damage despite its softness. The player can activate this ability in combat by pressing the \"F\" key. The equipped effect of this spirit moderately reduces the stamina cost for jumps and jump attacks. The menu also shows a list of other spirits available for selection, and a demo of the ability is playing in a small window. The player's stats, such as health, stamina, and various resistances, are displayed on the right side of the screen."
