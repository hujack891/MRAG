    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dynamic combat scene from a video game. The player character, positioned in the foreground, is engaged in an action that emits green and blue energy effects, suggesting a magical or special attack. The environment is a rocky, cave-like setting with a wooden structure in the background. The user interface displays various elements: a health bar at the bottom left with a white and blue gauge, and a circular icon that likely represents a special ability or charge. On the right, there are icons for different abilities or items, with labels indicating button mappings (RT, LT) for quick access. The top right shows a \"+105\" score or experience gain, and a \"Will\" meter with a count of 12, possibly indicating a resource or currency used for abilities.
