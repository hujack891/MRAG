    "img_summary": "The image is from a video game interface showing the \"Equipment\" menu, specifically focusing on the \"Spirits\" section. It highlights the \"Spearbone,\" a rare spirit with a high Qi cost, described as an \"Evil Banisher.\" The spirit allows the player to take its form, using a tiger shield to ward off attacks and repel foes, with abilities to bash enemies and shake them within range. The equipped effect slightly increases damage reduction. The player's level is 91, with detailed basic attributes such as health, mana, stamina, attack, and defense displayed on the right side. There are also stats for critical hit chance and damage, damage bonus, and reduction, alongside resistances to various banes like chill, burn, poison, and shock. The interface provides options to sort spirits by acquisition order and to equip the selected spirit."
