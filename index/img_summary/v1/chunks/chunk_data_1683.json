    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a player character is engaged in combat with an enemy named \"Yellowbrow.\" The environment appears to be a dimly lit temple with large columns and statues. The enemy is shown performing a powerful attack, emitting bright blue lightning effects. The player character is crouched, wielding a spear, and seems to be preparing to counter or evade the attack. The user interface displays various elements: health bars at the bottom left, indicating the player's current health and possibly stamina or mana; a name bar for the enemy \"Yellowbrow\" at the bottom center; and several icons on the bottom right, likely representing abilities or items available to the player. The icons include symbols that might correspond to different types of attacks or spells, with button prompts for activation."
