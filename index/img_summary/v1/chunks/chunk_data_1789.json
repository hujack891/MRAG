    "img_summary": "The image shows a combat encounter in a dark, rocky environment with a reddish tone. The player character, wearing a yellowish robe and holding a staff-like weapon, is engaged in a fight with a humanoid enemy wielding a large, glowing spear. The enemy has a visible health bar above its head, indicating its status. The user interface (UI) displays various elements: a health bar, stamina bar, and what appears to be a magic or special ability gauge in the bottom left. On the right side, there are icons for abilities or items, with button prompts (e.g., R2, R1). In the background, additional enemies or NPCs can be seen, suggesting potential reinforcements or hazards. The scene emphasizes strategic combat and resource management."
