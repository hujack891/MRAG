    "img_summary": "The image depicts a gameplay scene from a video game set in a rocky, barren environment. A large, stone-like creature is prominently featured, likely an enemy or boss character. The UI on the left side provides instructions for combat moves: \"Earth Shatter\" (light attack), \"Mountain Splitter\" (heavy attack), and \"Rockfall\" (spell). Each move has specific actions and effects, such as striking the enemy multiple times or causing area damage. At the bottom, a health bar labeled \"Shigandang\" suggests the creature's name or type, indicating it is the current target. On the lower right, there are icons possibly representing abilities or items, alongside a circular icon that might be related to the player's status or abilities."
