    "img_summary": "The image depicts a monstrous, multi-limbed creature standing in front of an old, weathered building with twisted roots surrounding it. The creature appears to be a significant adversary, likely encountered in \"The Duskveil - Purple Cloud Mountain\" section of Chapter 4 titled \"Secrets\" from the document. The preceding text suggests that this creature may be related to the boss fight with Daoist Mi, who transforms into a formidable opponent with two phases. The image serves to illustrate the challenging encounter players will face in this part of the narrative."
