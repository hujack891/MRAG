    "img_summary": "The image displays a game interface focused on upgrading spirits. On the left, there is a grid showing various spirits that can be acquired and upgraded, each with a distinct icon. The highlighted spirit is named \"Guangmou,\" classified as \"Epic,\" with a high Qi cost. The description notes that the spirit's upgraded effect reduces the Qi cost for its skill. Additionally, the equipped effect moderately increases poison damage and resistance. The interface includes options to sort spirits by rarity and watch a demo. At the bottom, there's a cultivation option requiring the player to hold a button, with a display showing current and required Will points (2630/1500). The top right corner shows a total of 2630 points available."
