    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic moment from the \"Son of Stones\" boss fight in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" It shows the Son of Stones, a massive stone figure, with green lightning effects and debris flying around, suggesting an intense attack or transformation. This visual is likely illustrating the part of the guide where the boss uses powerful lightning attacks, which players must avoid and then exploit the boss's vulnerability to deal significant damage. The surrounding environment appears to be a mountainous and forested area, aligning with the Foothills setting described in the guide."
