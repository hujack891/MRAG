In fact, you may want to attempt this optional fight later on, especially after you've completed the rest of Chapter 4 and gotten tougher armor sets and weapons before challenging him. While he doesn't have a huge moveset, the attacks he does can some fast, and when imbued with lightning can often kill you before you're able to react.\nIf you do challenge him early, you should really consider arming yourself to the teeth: Upgrade the Loongscale Armor to reduce shock duration, stock up on every medicine you can think of in addition to Shock-Quelling Powder, and ask the Xu Dog for extra pills that may include rare ones that give you boosts of health or damage increases. Such a powerful foe is deserving of your good consumables -- but you may want to practice a bit first before using them in battle.\n\nThe other move is even more aggravating, as he can Cloud Step without warning even when standing around between moves if you try to attack, and can completely waste a fully charged strike. He'll dash backward while intangible, then quickly race forward to strike -- though you can turn that tables by deflecting his counter-attack.",
    "img_below_text": "Because of this, its often better to rely on building your focus with light attack combos, and only unleash heavy attacks after deflecting with Rock Solid for an instant hit that he won't have time to dodge. Getting your meter filled to the fourth focus point also ensures you'll be dealing the best possible damage that will knock him down every time.\n\nExpect this fight to take a lot of attempts as you learn the different ways he can string his combos together, when the best times are to catch him off guard, and - most importantly - practice dodging his lightning dive-bomb attacks that can kill your attempt in an instant. Try to get rid of the Shocked status effect any time you get inflicted, so long as you don't leave yourself open while doing so.\n\nOnce Yellow Loong is finally revealed, his fate will be sealed, as the Ancient Master whose garment he was hiding in will convince the ancient dragon to relinquish his power, channeling it into his polearm, which you can grab to obtain the Golden Lining Transformation Spell to become a Loong yourself! You'll also finally get the last ingredient types to craft the ultimate Loong Staff Weapon!\n\nYellow Loong",
