    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where the player character is standing in a dimly lit, rocky environment. The character is near a glowing blue flame, which is likely an item or resource that can be collected, as indicated by the on-screen prompt \"RT Take.\" The user interface displays various elements: on the left, there are hexagonal icons possibly representing abilities or items, and on the bottom, there are health and stamina bars, along with additional icons that might indicate skills or actions available to the player. The environment suggests a cave or underground setting with patches of grass and rocks."
