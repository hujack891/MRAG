    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where a character is navigating through a rocky cave environment. The character is holding a staff with a glowing red tip, suggesting it might be used for combat or illumination. On the right side of the screen, there is a notification indicating that the player has acquired \"Will x5.\" The bottom of the screen displays various icons and gauges, likely representing the character's abilities, health, or resources. The cave is dimly lit, with some light coming from the passage ahead, creating an atmosphere of exploration or adventure."
