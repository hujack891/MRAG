Still, when it does get close enough to strike, a well-timed Rock Solid deflection can send it crashing to the ground, and is useful to have for this fight. It can also use frozen winds to deal chilling attacks you should be ready for, so have warming medicine on hand or consider equipping a Curio that reduces frostbite, and consider trying the Ring of Fire to warm yourself up.\n\nOnce it's tired of staying on the ground, it will often spread its wings wide to create another gust of freezing wind in a huge radius as it propels itself back into the air, where it can perform a number of attacks.",
