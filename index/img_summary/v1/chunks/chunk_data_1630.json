The player character, equipped with a spear and wearing a cloak made of straw, is crouching and appears to be sneaking up on an enemy. The enemy, dressed in red, is highlighted with a health bar above their head, indicating they are a target. In the background, another enemy can be seen. The environment features snow-covered trees and a rocky landscape, with a large, dinosaur-like creature partially visible on the right.
