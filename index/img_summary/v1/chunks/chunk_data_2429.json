    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a dark, cavernous environment with rocky walls and patches of green grass. The central character, wearing a fur-like cloak, is holding a torch that emits a warm glow, illuminating the immediate area. In front of the character, there is a coiled object on the ground, possibly an item to interact with or collect. The user interface (UI) displays several elements: on the left, hexagonal icons likely representing inventory items or abilities, with one showing a count of 17; on the bottom, a health bar with a white and blue segment; and on the right, circular icons with symbols and button prompts, suggesting available actions or skills. The scene suggests exploration or preparation for interaction within the game."
