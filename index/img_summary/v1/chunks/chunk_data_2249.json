    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy environment with a large, muscular enemy wielding a stone, engaging in combat with a smaller character dressed in red. The smaller character appears to be dodging or attacking the larger enemy. In the background, another enemy is visible, possibly preparing to attack. The user interface displays several elements: a health bar at the bottom left, indicating the player's current health status; a series of icons on the left and right sides, likely representing abilities or items that can be used with specific button inputs (RT, LT); and a mini-map on the bottom right corner showing the player's location. The environment features snow-covered trees and stone structures, suggesting a temple-like setting."
