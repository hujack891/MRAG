    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game showing a character in a stealthy stance, holding a spear, and approaching two enemies on a snow-covered wooden walkway. The character is wearing a cloak that blends with the environment, suggesting a stealth approach. The enemies are positioned ahead, with one having a visible health bar and an alert icon above their head, indicating they are aware of the player's presence. The game interface displays various icons and gauges, including health and ability meters, at the bottom of the screen. The setting features traditional Asian architecture with snow-covered rooftops and trees in the background."
