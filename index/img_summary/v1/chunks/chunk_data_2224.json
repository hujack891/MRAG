    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy, rocky environment. The player character, wielding a staff, is approaching a large enemy with a red health bar above its head, indicating a potential combat encounter. The enemy appears to be a muscular humanoid creature. The user interface (UI) displays various elements: in the bottom left, there are icons arranged in a radial menu, likely representing different abilities or items. At the bottom center, there are three bars, possibly indicating health, stamina, and another resource. In the bottom right, additional icons and a mini-map are visible, showing the player's location and available actions. The environment suggests a cave entrance behind the enemy, hinting at a possible objective or path forward."
