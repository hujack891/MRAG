Upon reaching Chapter 4 in the Webbed Hollow, he will become bewitched, and will need your help to free himself of the lure of the Crimson Spider.\n* Rewards: Blood Stained Needle, Jade Moon Rabbit Curio, Fine Gold Thread, 3410 Experience x2, 2578-2612 Will x2\n## Zhu Bajie Boss Fight and Guide - Second Encounter\nFor this encounter, the pig clearly has the home field advantage, and he'll remind you every step of the way with a wide variety of painful moves that are extremely hard to dodge.\n\nHe'll start by transforming into a giant carp fish, which will wiggle a bit before leaping high into the air. Immediately get onto your Pillar Stance before he slams down on the ground, as it will release a shockwave across the mud that's hard to dodge given the conditions of the arena. You'll only have a moment to land your Pillar Stance smash, but after that you should only be focused on evasion (you won't be able to Immobilize his transformations).",
