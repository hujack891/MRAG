    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game, displaying the equipment menu where the player can select a spirit called \"Snake Herbalist.\" This spirit is classified as rare and has a moderate Qi cost. Its ability, \"Venom Spray,\" allows the player to take the form of the Snake Herbalist and create poisonous pools by smashing venom from a herb basket on the ground. Enemies stepping into these pools will accumulate Poison Bane. The equipped effect of this spirit recovers a small amount of health when taking medicines. The interface shows various stats on the right side, including health, stamina, and other attributes. The player can press 'F' to use the spirit in combat and 'E' to equip it. There is also an option to watch a demo of the spirit's ability."
