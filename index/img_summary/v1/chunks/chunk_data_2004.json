    "img_summary": "The image shows a game menu screen focused on the \"Equipment\" section, specifically highlighting a rare spirit called \"Snake Herbalist.\" The spirit has a skill called \"Venom Spray,\" which allows the player to take the form of the Snake Herbalist and create poisonous pools on the ground. These pools inflict \"Poison Bane\" on enemies that step into them. The spirit's Qi cost is moderate, and it has an equipped effect that recovers a small amount of health when taking medicines. The interface includes various UI components such as health and attribute bars on the right, and a list of spirits on the left. There's also a small demo video showing the spirit in action, and options to equip or watch a demo. The top menu bar includes options like Self-Advance, Relics, Inventory, Journal, and Settings."
