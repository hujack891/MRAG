    "img_summary": "The image depicts a cave entrance leading to a rocky, mountainous environment. The scene is dark, with the cave interior in shadow, contrasting against the bright, misty landscape visible through the opening. A small stack of stones is visible on the ground outside the cave, suggesting a path or marker. A red circular icon with a silhouette of a character is positioned at the top right of the cave entrance, indicating a point of interest or an objective in the gameplay. This icon likely serves as a guide for players to focus on or interact with the highlighted area."
