The character is holding a staff and appears to be in motion. On the right side of the screen, there is an enemy wielding a large axe. The user interface (UI) shows several elements: a health bar at the top right with a \"+25\" indicator, and a list of collected items including \"Will,\" \"Tiny Piece of Gold,\" and \"Stone Spirit.\" The bottom left corner displays various icons likely representing abilities or items, while the bottom center shows additional character or ability icons. The environment is detailed with wooden structures and natural elements, suggesting a blend of man-made and natural obstacles."
