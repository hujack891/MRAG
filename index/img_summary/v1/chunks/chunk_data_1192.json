On the bottom left, there is a player health bar and a set of icons, possibly representing abilities or items. On the bottom right, additional icons suggest more abilities or actions, with button prompts labeled \"RT\" and \"RB,\" indicating controller inputs. The text \"and spill!\" appears at the bottom, possibly part of a dialogue or narrative element."
