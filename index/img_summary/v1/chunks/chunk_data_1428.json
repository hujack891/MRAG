    "img_summary": "The image shows a traditional Japanese pellet drum, known as a den-den daiko, which is likely an in-game item or artifact. The drum features a circular frame with a floral design on its surface and has a handle attached. This item may be used for specific gameplay functions such as triggering events, solving puzzles, or interacting with characters or environments within the game. The absence of UI components, characters, or text hints suggests that the focus is on the drum itself, indicating its significance in the game."
