    "img_summary": "The image shows a traditional Japanese pellet drum, known as a den-den daiko. It features a circular drum head with floral decorations, mounted on a red handle. The drum has small black pellets attached to strings on either side, which create sound when the drum is rotated. The background is dark and blurred, focusing attention on the drum itself."
