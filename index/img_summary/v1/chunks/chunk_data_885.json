    "img_summary": "The image shows a barren, rocky landscape with a character in the foreground, wearing a hat and carrying a staff or weapon on their back. The environment is dark and desolate, with a prominent red glow on the ground, highlighted by a red arrow, suggesting a point of interest or a clue for the player. This glow might indicate a hidden item, a quest marker, or a path to follow. The overall setting appears to be a volcanic or mountainous area, with jagged rock formations in the background. The image is likely part of a guide to help players navigate or identify important locations within the game."
