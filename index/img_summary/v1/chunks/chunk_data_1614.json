    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy environment with a pagoda-style building in the background, surrounded by mountains and trees. The central character, silhouetted against the light, is walking towards the building, carrying a large spear. The user interface displays various elements: a health bar at the bottom left with three segments, and icons indicating abilities or items on the bottom right, labeled with buttons for activation (RT, RB). Additional icons are present on the left side, possibly representing inventory or skills. The environment suggests a traditional Asian architectural style, contributing to the atmospheric setting of the game."
