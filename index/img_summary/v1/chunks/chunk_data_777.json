    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game, displaying the equipment menu focused on \"Spirits.\" The highlighted spirit is \"Dragonfly Guai,\" classified as a rare item with a moderate Qi cost. Its ability, \"Rain of Arrows,\" allows the player to take the form of Dragonfly Guai and shoot poison arrows at enemies. The equipped effect slightly increases Qi gained from hits but reduces maximum health, mana, and stamina. The interface shows options to equip the spirit, watch a demo, and use it in combat by pressing 'F.' The player's stats are visible on the right, indicating current health, mana, and other attributes. The top menu includes tabs for Self-Advance, Relics, Inventory, Journal, and Settings, with a currency count and Qi level displayed."
