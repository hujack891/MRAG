    "img_summary": "The image displays the equipment menu from a video game, focusing on the selection of a spirit called \"Mad Tiger.\" This spirit is classified as Epic and has a high Qi cost. Its ability, \"Boulder Smash,\" allows the player to transform into Mad Tiger, using a powerful roar to shock nearby enemies and deal area damage. The equipped effect significantly boosts attack power but reduces maximum health. The interface shows various spirits available for selection, each with unique icons. On the right side, the player's basic attributes are listed, including health, mana, stamina, attack, and defense, along with additional statistics like critical hit chance and damage. The player's level is 103, with a health bar indicating current and maximum health. The menu provides options to equip the spirit, watch a demo, and sort spirits by acquisition order."
