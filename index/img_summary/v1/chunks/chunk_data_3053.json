The player character, Wukong, is engaged in battle against the miniboss \"Non-White\" in a snowy, stone-paved arena surrounded by rocky cliffs. The miniboss appears to be using poison-based attacks, as indicated by the green mist surrounding it. The player's health and abilities are displayed in the UI, emphasizing the strategic use of items like the Fiery Gourd or Ring of Fire to counter frost and poison effects mentioned in the preceding text. This image visually reinforces the guide's advice on preparing for Non-White's aggressive moves and environmental challenges."
