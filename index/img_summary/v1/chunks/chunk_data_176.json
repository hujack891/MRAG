    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a player character, dressed in red and wielding a staff, is engaged in combat with a large, electric-blue dragon-like enemy named \"Chen Loong.\" The environment is a rocky, snowy coastal area, with waves crashing onto the shore. The user interface displays several elements: a health bar for \"Chen Loong\" at the bottom center, indicating the enemy's remaining health, and a player health bar at the bottom left, showing the player's current health status. There are various icons on the screen, likely representing abilities or items available to the player, positioned on the left and right sides of the screen. The scene suggests a boss battle, with the player needing to manage health and abilities to defeat the formidable enemy."
