    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy environment with a character engaged in combat against multiple humanoid enemies. The enemies are wearing robes and hats, and each has a visible health bar above their heads. The player character is executing an attack that causes a large rock to smash into the ground, suggesting the use of the \"Rockfall\" spell, which is indicated in the UI on the left side of the screen. The UI lists three combat options: \"Earth Shatter\" for light attacks, \"Mountain Splitter\" for heavy attacks, and \"Rockfall\" for spell attacks, each with corresponding button prompts. Additionally, there is a health bar at the bottom of the screen, showing the player's current health status. The environment features a traditional Asian-style building and stone steps, contributing to the setting's aesthetic."
