    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy environment, featuring a combat scenario. The player character is engaged in battle with multiple enemies, using a powerful attack that causes debris to scatter. On the left side of the screen, there are instructions for different attack moves: \"Earth Shatter\" (light attack), \"Mountain Splitter\" (heavy attack), and \"Rockfall\" (spell). Each move has a brief description of its effect, such as striking enemies or causing area damage. The bottom of the screen shows a health bar and icons related to the player's abilities. The background includes a traditional-style building and snow-covered terrain."
