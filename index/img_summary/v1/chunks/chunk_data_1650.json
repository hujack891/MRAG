    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game, depicting a character standing in a snowy environment in front of a large, traditional wooden building. The character is holding a spear with a fiery tip and is wearing a cloak made of straw or grass. The interface displays various icons and meters, indicating the character's status and available actions. A red circle highlights a point of interest near a statue, where another figure is crouching. The game seems to involve exploration and possibly combat, as suggested by the character's weapon and the HUD elements."
