    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic transition between two contrasting environments within the \"Corridor of Fire and Ice\" section of Bishui Cave in *Black Myth: Wukong*. On the left, glowing lava and dark rocky surfaces represent the fiery portion of the area, while on the right, icy formations and a cold, blue-lit ambiance signify the ice-covered section. Central to the scene is a mystical swirling energy emanating from an altar-like structure, suggesting an important interactive or narrative element. This visual aligns with the walkthrough's description of navigating through these elemental zones, collecting key items, and progressing toward the Keeper's Shrine."
