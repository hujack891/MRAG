    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy courtyard environment with traditional architecture in the background. Two humanoid characters are visible: one wearing a blue robe and prayer beads, gesturing with their hand, and another resembling an anthropomorphic boar with a similar outfit and a weapon slung over their shoulder. A text prompt at the bottom reads, \"Buddha? Where is it?\" suggesting dialogue or a quest-related interaction. The scene appears to be part of a narrative or quest progression in the game."
