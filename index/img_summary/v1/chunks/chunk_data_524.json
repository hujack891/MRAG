    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where a character is engaged in combat with a large, armored creature resembling a scorpion, named \"The Scorpionlord.\" The setting is a forest with autumn foliage. On the left side of the image, instructions for two types of attacks are visible: \"Light Attack 'Sprouting Spring'\" which involves performing consecutive slashes to build up Focus, and \"Heavy Attack 'Withering Winter'\" which is slower but deals more damage and builds up Focus faster. The health bar of \"The Scorpionlord\" is displayed at the bottom, indicating the ongoing battle. The game interface includes various icons and a gauge at the bottom right corner."
