    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene from the game *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing the protagonist battling the Black Wind King in his human form during the boss fight in Black Wind Cave. The environment is dark and atmospheric, with fire-lit surroundings and dense vegetation. The Black Wind King is wielding a weapon and engaging in close combat, while the player character executes fiery attacks, as indicated by the glowing effects and action prompts on the screen (\"Light Attack 'Moon Dance'\" and \"Heavy Attack 'Moon Chase'\"). A dialogue at the bottom highlights the Black Wind King's taunt: \"You! I asked you to guard the bells for your master. You failed!\" The image emphasizes the intensity and mechanics of the fight, aligning with the guide's description of the boss's powerful attacks and strategies."
