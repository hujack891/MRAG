    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy mountainous environment. The main character, equipped with a staff, is moving through the snow-covered terrain. The user interface displays several elements: a health bar at the bottom center, which includes a white, blue, and yellow segment; icons on the bottom left and right corners, likely representing abilities or items, each associated with the RT button; and a mini-map on the bottom right. A red-dotted circle highlights a glowing object in the distance, suggesting a point of interest or objective. The environment is rugged, with large rocks and cliffs, and snow is falling, adding to the atmospheric conditions."
