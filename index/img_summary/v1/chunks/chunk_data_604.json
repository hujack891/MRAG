Strangely enough, it also starts the fight at around 75% of its health, but it does have a second health bar waiting, so pacing yourself can be the key to this fight.\n\nOne quick nasty attack to watch out for is if you spot The Duskveil pivot to hide its left arm behind its body, it will launch a very quick jab with that arm, but the good news is that it won't follow up this attack with any others.",
