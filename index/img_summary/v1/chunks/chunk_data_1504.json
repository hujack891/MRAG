The player character is shown wielding a weapon with a glowing tip, facing off against the boss. The user interface includes a health bar for the Macaque Chief at the bottom center, indicating the boss's remaining health. On the bottom left, there are icons representing various abilities or items, with numeric indicators suggesting their quantity or level. The bottom right displays additional icons, likely representing different abilities or status effects, also with numeric values. A text prompt at the bottom provides a motivational message: \"Boy, you've got no less fur than him. Don't let him outdo you!\" This suggests a narrative element encouraging the player to persevere in the fight."
