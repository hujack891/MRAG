    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where a character is engaged in combat with a large, rocky creature in a barren, rocky landscape. The creature appears to be made of stone, resembling a golem, and is positioned in the center of the image. The player character is in the foreground, holding a weapon and seemingly preparing to attack or defend. The game's interface displays health bars labeled \"Stone Vanguard\" and \"Shigandang,\" indicating the names of the entities involved in the battle. Various icons are visible on the screen, likely representing abilities or items available to the player. The environment is desolate, with dry grass and rocky formations, and a partially collapsed structure is visible in the background."
