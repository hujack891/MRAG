    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a dark, cavernous environment. A character dressed in rugged, medieval-style armor is standing in the foreground, holding a long, staff-like weapon. The cave is dimly lit, with stalactites hanging from the ceiling and stalagmites rising from the ground. There is a patch of green vegetation on the cave floor, and a cluster of glowing mushrooms or fungi is visible on the right side. A red arrow is pointing towards a specific area in the distance, suggesting a direction or point of interest for the player to explore."
