The player character appears to be engaged in combat with Non-White, who is using frost-based attacks, as indicated by the icy environment and the frost effect icon on the screen. The health bar labeled \"Non-White\" suggests the boss fight is ongoing, while the fiery visuals hint at the use of fire-based abilities, possibly to counter the frost effects. The UI displays health, stamina, and item options, emphasizing the strategic nature of the fight. This image serves to illustrate the intense and challenging combat mechanics described in the walkthrough."
