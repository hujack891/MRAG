    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense combat scene from a video game, where a player character is executing a fiery attack on a large, grotesque enemy named \"Elder Jinchi.\" The enemy is engulfed in flames, suggesting a powerful offensive move. On the left side of the image, there are on-screen instructions detailing different attack options: \"Light Attack 'Moon Dance'\" with the X button, \"Heavy Attack 'Moon Chase'\" with the Y button, and a special move that combines dodge with a heavy attack using the B and Y buttons. At the bottom, a health bar labeled \"Elder Jinchi\" indicates the enemy's remaining health. The environment appears to be an outdoor area with a dark, ominous atmosphere. The UI elements include a circular icon in the bottom right corner, possibly representing the player's current status or abilities."
