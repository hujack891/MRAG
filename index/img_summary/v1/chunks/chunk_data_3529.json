The red markers in the image likely indicate points of interest or objectives. This scene is part of the \"Ashen Pass I\" section in the \"Woods of Ember Walkthrough\" for the game Black Myth: Wukong. The preceding text suggests that players have just regained control of their character and are about to navigate through a tunnel to reach the first Keeper's Shrine of the chapter. The image serves to visually guide players through this initial area of the Ashen Pass I."
