The protagonist, referred to as the \"Destined One,\" is shown wading through a reflective body of water in a rocky, arid environment. The interface displays game elements such as health, abilities, and an item notification for acquiring a \"Jade Lotus.\" This visual likely represents exploration within the Sandgate Village area, setting the stage for navigating the rugged terrain and encountering challenges or collectibles."
