A red arrow points towards a specific spot on the ground, indicating an area of interest. This visual likely serves to guide players to a key location where they can collect the green Wisp, as mentioned in the preceding text. The setting appears to be a crucial part of the walkthrough, helping players navigate through the Valley Entrance and prepare for encounters with enemies like Scorching-Fire rocks."
