The player character is in the foreground, seemingly attacking with a weapon, as indicated by the bright sparks and energy emanating from the point of contact. The game's interface is visible, showing health and stamina bars, as well as various ability icons on the screen. The environment is dark and atmospheric, with skeletal remains scattered on the ground, suggesting a dangerous and foreboding setting."
