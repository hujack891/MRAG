    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game interface showing the equipment menu. It highlights the \"Rat Governor,\" a rare spirit that can be equipped. The Rat Governor allows the player to take its form, leap with a staff, and shoot lightning to deal Thunder Damage. The equipped effect moderately increases Thunder Damage. The player's level is 91, with various basic attributes displayed, including health, mana, stamina, attack, defense, and critical hit statistics. The player's resistance to different types of damage—chill, burn, poison, and shock—is also shown. The interface offers options to equip, watch a demo, and sort spirits by acquisition order."
