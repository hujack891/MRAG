    "img_summary": "The image displays a character equipment screen from a video game, focusing on the \"Rat Governor\" spirit, which is classified as \"Rare\" with a moderate Qi cost. The spirit allows the player to transform into the Rat Governor, enabling them to leap and shoot lightning from a staff, dealing Thunder Damage. The player can activate this ability in combat by pressing the \"F\" key. The equipped effect moderately increases Thunder Damage. The screen also shows a list of spirits available for selection, with various character icons. On the right side, the player's level is 91, with detailed basic attributes such as health (690), mana (380), stamina (310), attack (102), and defense (348). Additionally, there are resistances to different elements, including Chill, Burn, Poison, and Shock. The interface includes options for self-advance, relics, inventory, journal, and settings, with navigation prompts for sorting and examining items."
