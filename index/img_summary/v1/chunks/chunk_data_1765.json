The player character, named \"Old Ginseng Guai,\" is engaged in combat, as indicated by the health bar at the bottom of the screen. The character is performing an attack, causing debris and dust to scatter. On the left side of the screen, instructions for two types of attacks are visible: \"Light Attack 'Earth Shatter,'\" which involves striking the enemy three times with a heavy head, and \"Heavy Attack 'Mountain Splitter,'\" which involves dashing forward with full force and charging to dash further. The top right corner shows numerical values, possibly indicating points or currency. The game interface includes icons and a circular map in the bottom right corner."
