    "img_summary": "The image shows a humanoid enemy in a dark, rocky cave-like environment. The character has a heavily scarred and burned appearance, adorned with beads and a cloth sash, and is wielding a sharp weapon in one hand. A small, ornate stone lantern is visible on the left side of the image, suggesting a shrine or ceremonial area. The setting appears dimly lit, with light filtering in from the left, creating a tense and atmospheric scene. This enemy likely serves as a significant challenge or boss encounter in the game."
