    "img_summary": "The image shows a character in a dark cave environment, holding a torch that illuminates the immediate area. The character is wearing a cloak made of what appears to be natural materials. The cave walls are covered with webs, suggesting a potentially dangerous or unexplored area. In the distance, a red-circled glowing object or marker is visible, possibly indicating a point of interest or objective. The user interface (UI) at the bottom left displays a health bar and several icons, likely representing abilities or items available to the player. The bottom right UI shows additional icons, possibly for skills or actions, with button prompts for activation. This scene likely involves exploration or a quest objective within the game."
