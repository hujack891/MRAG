    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy, mountainous environment. A character dressed in red and wielding a long staff is positioned in the foreground, seemingly moving towards a large stone statue. The statue is seated and partially covered in snow, suggesting it may be an important landmark or objective in the game. The user interface displays various icons and gauges, including a health bar, a compass, and ability icons, indicating the player's current status and available actions. A red arrow points towards the statue, possibly highlighting it as a point of interest or a target for interaction. The environment is detailed with rocky terrain and snow-covered surfaces, enhancing the immersive atmosphere of the game."
