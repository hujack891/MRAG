    "img_summary": "The image displays the equipment menu from a video game, focusing on the selection of spirits. The highlighted spirit is the \"Commander Beetle,\" classified as Epic, with a high Qi cost. Its ability, \"Blade Flurry,\" allows the player to take the form of the Commander Beetle, spinning twin blades to attack targets and deal area damage. The equipped effect moderately increases poison resistance. The menu shows various spirit options, each with distinct icons and appearances. On the right, there is a demonstration video of the Commander Beetle's ability in action. The user interface includes character stats such as health, attack power, and defense, alongside other attributes. The top bar provides navigation options like Self-Advance, Relics, Inventory, Journal, and Settings, with indicators for new items or updates."
