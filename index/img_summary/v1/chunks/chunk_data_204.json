The character, wielding a staff, is attacking a creature with a furry appearance. Sparks fly from the point of impact, indicating a hit. Above the enemy, a health bar is visible, showing its current health status. In the upper part of the image, another enemy wearing yellow is seen climbing a rock wall. The user interface displays various icons on the bottom left and right corners, likely representing abilities, items, or actions available to the player.

Text at the bottom reads, \"You'll know my strength soon enough!\" suggesting dialogue or a taunt from the enemy."
