Plan ahead by crafting or buying Body-Warming Pills to offset this.\n\nThese formidable foes are pretty beefy, and use their wicked weapons to throw at you like boomerangs from a distance. They can also string long combo attacks together, requiring you to interrupt one with a Rock Solid deflection or wait until their final leaping slash or delayed uppercut to retaliate.\n\nOnce the Patroller is down, you can find a green Wisp to absorb at the foot of the building to replenish your gourd, but there's not much else here.",
