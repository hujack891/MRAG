    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character sitting in a snowy forest environment, wearing a fur cloak and a necklace made of large beads. The character appears to be in distress, with visible injuries and a sorrowful expression. Surrounding the character are natural elements like trees and ferns, along with a bowl and scattered stones on the ground. At the bottom of the image, there is a text hint: \"I beg you, sir, to take my fur and wear my form. Confront him and calm my sorrowful heart.\" This suggests a quest or task in the game where the player may need to take on the character's appearance or role to confront another entity and resolve the character's emotional turmoil."
