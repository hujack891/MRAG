    "img_summary": "The image appears to be a screenshot from a video game, depicting a gameplay moment with a focus on combat mechanics. On the left side of the screen, there are instructions for two types of attacks: a \"Light Attack\" called \"Earth Shatter,\" which involves striking the enemy three times with a heavy head, and a \"Heavy Attack\" named \"Mountain Splitter,\" which allows the player to dash forward with full force and charge further. The environment looks like a rocky or sandy terrain, suggesting an outdoor setting. In the bottom right corner, there is a UI element showing a circular icon with a character or creature's face, possibly indicating the player's character or a special ability. There are also hexagonal icons above it, which might represent different abilities or status effects. A health or stamina bar is visible at the bottom left, providing information about the player's current status."
