On the left side, there are two attack moves listed: \"Light Attack 'Earth Shatter'\" which involves striking the enemy three times with a heavy head, and \"Heavy Attack 'Mountain Splitter'\" which involves dashing forward with full force, with the option to fully charge for a further dash. The bottom right corner shows a character icon and some game interface elements, including a health or energy bar at the bottom. The background appears to be a rocky or sandy terrain."
