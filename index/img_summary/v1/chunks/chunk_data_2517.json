The player character, armed with a staff, is seen moving deeper into the cave, suggesting exploration or preparation for combat. In the background, a wooden structure resembling a tomb or ancient building is visible, reinforcing the narrative context of \"The Loong’s Secret Tomb\" in the \"Valley of Despair\" section of the *Sandgate Village Walkthrough*. This setting likely precedes an encounter with the Swift Bat enemy mentioned in the text, emphasizing the dangerous and atmospheric progression of the game."
