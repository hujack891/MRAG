    "img_summary": "The image displays an equipment menu from a video game, focusing on the selection of a spirit called \"Fungiwoman,\" classified as an Epic item with a high Qi cost. The description explains that the player can transform into Fungiwoman, allowing them to drift through the air with a mushroom cap and release spores. Upon landing, these spores rain down on enemies, potentially recovering health if they hit. The interface shows a grid of various spirits available for selection, with Fungiwoman highlighted. The right side of the screen displays player stats, including health, attack, and defense values, some of which have modifiers. A small demo video is shown, illustrating Fungiwoman in action. The player can equip this spirit by pressing 'E' and use it in combat with the 'F' key."
