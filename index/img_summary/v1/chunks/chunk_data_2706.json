The foreground shows a player character preparing for battle, emphasizing the confrontation. This visual aligns with the guide's description of the boss fight in Chapter 6 of *Black Myth: Wukong*, where players are instructed to approach the cliff edge to engage the Son of Stones. The image serves to illustrate the boss's imposing presence and the environment of the encounter."
