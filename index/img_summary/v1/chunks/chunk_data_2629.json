That way is blocked by a tough looking new enemy, the Monk Supporter.\n## Frost-Clad Path\n### Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Macaque Chief (First Encounter)\nYou can consider this one half of a real boss fight, since you won't actually defeat this miniboss here. Despite that, the Macaque Chief is not to be taken lightly. Many of his attacks inflict Frost, and if your bar fills, you'll have extremely reduced mobility and be unable to dodge many of his attacks. Plan ahead by crafting or buying Body-Warming Pills to offset this.\n\nWith the area now clear, you're free to continue up the mountain path to a large walled temple in the distance. Once you reach the final set of stairs leading up to the temple, be ready for a Cyan Bat hanging from a nearby tree to ambush you.",

It shows the player character standing on a snow-covered staircase, looking towards a distant, large walled temple. The environment is wintry, with snow-covered structures and barren trees. A red circle highlights a point of interest, likely indicating an upcoming ambush by a Cyan Bat, as mentioned in the preceding text. This image serves to visually guide players through the game's challenging terrain and prepare them for the encounter ahead."
