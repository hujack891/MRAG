The environment is a lush field with yellow flowers and trees in the background. The user interface displays various consumable items and abilities, such as \"Evil Repelling Medicament,\" \"Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets,\" \"Shock-Quelling Powder,\" and \"Longevity Decoction,\" each with their respective quantities. Additionally, there are abilities labeled \"Rock Solid,\" \"Immobilize,\" \"Golden Lining,\" and \"A Pluck of Many,\" mapped to specific controller buttons.
