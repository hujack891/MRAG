    "img_summary": "The image depicts a gameplay moment from the boss fight against the Second Sister, a giant venomous spider in *Black Myth: Wukong*. Set in the eerie Village of Lanxi, the scene showcases the protagonist mid-combat, wielding a glowing weapon, while the spider unleashes an attack surrounded by sparks and movement effects. The environment features dark, web-covered structures and barren trees, emphasizing the tense and atmospheric nature of the battle. This image aligns with the guide's description of the Second Sister's challenging attack patterns and the importance of strategic retreat during her poison-based moves."
