It shows a player character standing near a rocky environment with prominent glowing blue crystals embedded in the rock face. These crystals are likely the target points for attacking the Giant Shigandang boss, as suggested by the preceding text, which emphasizes striking the blue crystals on its fists to defeat the monster. The image visually reinforces the strategy described in the guide, aiding players in identifying key elements during the fight."
