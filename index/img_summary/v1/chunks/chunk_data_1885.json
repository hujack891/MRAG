    "img_summary": "The image displays a game interface focused on the \"Equipment\" section, specifically highlighting a rare spirit called \"Puppet Tick.\" This spirit has a high Qi cost and features the ability \"Bursting Spiders,\" which allows the player to transform into Puppet Tick, summon Stone Spiders to attack enemies, and release venom upon their demise to poison nearby foes. The interface includes a demo video of the ability in action, which can be closed with the \"F\" key. The equipped effect of Puppet Tick reduces the mana cost for another ability, \"A Pluck of Many.\" The player's stats are shown on the right, including health, mana, and various attributes, with some values indicating recent changes. The UI also includes navigation options for other game sections like Self-Advance, Relics, Inventory, Journal, and Settings."
