A character is seen crouching and holding a long staff, moving towards a structure carved into a rocky cliff. The structure features multiple statues and pillars, suggesting it may be a significant location in the game. The user interface displays several key elements: a health bar at the bottom left, which includes three colored bars indicating different statuses, and icons for abilities or items. On the right side, there is a counter labeled \"Will\" with a value of 360, possibly indicating a resource or currency. Additionally, there are circular icons that might represent different abilities or actions the player can perform.
