Located at the center of the large black tornado in the Yellow Wind Formation in the center of the region, you'll need two Key Items to open a path to him.\n* **Rewards:** Samahdi Wind Agate, Cold Iron Leaves x2, Refined Iron Sand x1, Silk x5, Yaoguai Core x2, Mind Core x1, 2583 Experience, 1944 Will\n## Yellow Wind Sage Boss Fight and Guide\nThe final boss of Chapter 2 is a hulking rat who holds an incredible trident spear in one hand, while the other carries… a giant head? If you think this may limit his moves, you’re unfortunately in for a rude awakening. The Yellow Wind Sage has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, and is not only a deadly attacker, but a master of the Samadhi Winds — but more on that later.\nMake sure you're suitably prepared for the fight in the best ways possible: Craft a bunch of medicine to increase your damage absorption and max health, and allocate any Mind Cores you’ve found toward Celestial Medicine buffs. You should also have a full set of either the Galeguard or Insect armor fully crafted, as well as the Cloud-Patterened Stone Staff from defeating the optional Sihandang boss. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you’ve beaten the Chapter 2 Secret Boss and equipped the new Vessel, the Wind Tamer.\n\n* One version will run up to you with its free hand glowing and swing it upwards to trigger a line of sand spears to explode up from the ground. It will then launch into several sweeping attacks with its spear",
