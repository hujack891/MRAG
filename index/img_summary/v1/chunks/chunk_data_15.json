The spirit grants the ability to transform into the Apramāṇa Bat, allowing the player to leap into the air to evade attacks and release freezing gusts that deal Frost Damage. If the target's Frost gauge is maxed, they can be frozen in place. The UI shows various spirits available for selection, with the Apramāṇa Bat highlighted. On the right, player stats are displayed, including health, stamina, and various attributes. The menu offers options to equip the spirit, watch a demo, and sort spirits by acquisition order."
