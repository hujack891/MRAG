Oddly enough, despite his appearance, he doesn’t employ any poison attacks, so having the Celestial Lotus Seeds as your gourd’s Soak is the better option for this fight.\nThe Whiteclad Noble opts instead to attack with his strong spear, and can harness the power of water itself to amplify its reach. He’ll use it often to create waves of watery force you’ll need to dodge or suffer a lot of damage from. He’s also not above simply tossing his spear at you, and then calling it back to his hand.\n\nUnfortunately, you’re going to need to memorize these attacks and learn to take as little damage as possible, because depleting his health bar won’t end the fight. When you’ve knocked him down, he’ll begin to show you his true form, elongating his body in a larger serpent form, and replenishing his entire health bar.",
