    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the \"Yellow Sand Formation Walkthrough\" document. It shows a character standing in a rocky, desert-like environment, possibly near the Windseal Gate, as mentioned in the metadata. The character appears to be preparing to move forward, likely after defeating the Gore-Eye Daoist mini-boss. The setting includes large stone structures and a rugged landscape, which aligns with the narrative of exploring the final main region of Chapter 2. The image serves to illustrate the environment and progression point in the game following a significant mini-boss battle."
