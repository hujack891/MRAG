This moment follows the defeat of a lone archer and the removal of a curse, as described in the preceding text. The character must now be cautious of a Frozen Corpse as they prepare to cross the final wooden beam. The image serves to illustrate the treacherous environment and the challenges faced at this stage of the walkthrough."
