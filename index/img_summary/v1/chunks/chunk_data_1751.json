    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character is engaged in combat. The character, seen from behind, is wielding a weapon with a glowing orange tip, suggesting an attack or special ability. The environment is a rocky, snow-dusted area with cobblestone flooring. On the left side of the screen, text instructions for combat moves are visible, indicating \"Light Attack 'Moon Dance'\" and \"Heavy Attack 'Moon Chase'\" with corresponding button prompts (X and Y). The bottom of the screen shows a health bar labeled \"NonWhite,\" which is partially depleted, indicating the character's current health status. Additionally, a UI element on the right displays a set of icons, possibly for abilities or items, with one highlighted. The presence of green smoke or energy suggests a magical or poisonous effect in play."
