    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character is engaged in combat. The character is crouched on a stone-paved ground, wielding a weapon that emits a fiery glow. Green particles are visible in the air, suggesting some form of attack or effect. The game interface displays two attack options: \"Light Attack 'Moon Dance'\" and \"Heavy Attack 'Moon Chase',\" with descriptions for each. The character's name, \"NornWhite,\" is shown above a health bar at the bottom of the screen. The environment is rocky, with a statue visible in the background, and a small structure resembling a pagoda is seen to the right."
