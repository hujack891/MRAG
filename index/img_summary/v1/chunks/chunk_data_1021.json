    "img_summary": "The image displays a skill tree interface from a video game, focusing on three categories: Stamina, Martial Arts, and Survival. Each category has a series of nodes representing different skills or abilities. The highlighted skill is \"Endurance\" under the Survival category, which reduces the stamina cost of sprinting as the talent level increases. The right side of the screen shows a visual of a character running in a natural environment, reinforcing the skill's effect. The UI indicates the player has 1 \"Spark\" available to unlock or upgrade skills, with a prompt to \"Hold to Awaken\" using the \"A\" button."
