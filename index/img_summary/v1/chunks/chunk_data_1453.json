    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene from a video game where the player character is engaged in a battle with an enemy named \"Second Rat Prince.\" The environment appears to be a barren, rocky terrain. The enemy is a large, humanoid rat wielding a staff, and the player character is in close proximity, seemingly in a defensive stance. The UI shows various elements: on the bottom left, there is a health bar with a flame icon indicating the player's health status, and several icons possibly representing abilities or items. On the bottom right, more icons are visible, likely for different actions or skills, with button prompts for RT (right trigger) and LB (left bumper) suggesting control inputs. The enemy's health bar is displayed at the center bottom of the screen, indicating the current status of the \"Second Rat Prince.\""
