A large, centaur-like creature with a humanoid upper body and multiple limbs, named \"Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,\" is engaged in combat with a player character. The creature is wielding a glowing sword and is surrounded by a bright, golden aura. The player character, who appears to be armored and holding a weapon, is positioned in the foreground, facing the creature.
