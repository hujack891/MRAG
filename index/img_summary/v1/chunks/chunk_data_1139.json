The scene shows the deer in a snowy, rocky environment with sparse vegetation and dark, ominous lighting. The deer appears to be in a grounded position, possibly mid-battle, with its large antlers and imposing form highlighted. This image visually complements the preceding text, which provides strategies for defeating the Cloudtreading Deer, including the use of the Wind Tamer vessel to counter its tornado attacks."
