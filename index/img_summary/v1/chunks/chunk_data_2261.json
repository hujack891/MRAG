    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy environment with a character engaged in combat with an enemy. The character is wielding a staff and appears to be mid-action, possibly attacking the enemy, who has a visible health bar above their head. The environment includes a stone path leading through a wooden torii gate, surrounded by snow-covered trees. The user interface displays several elements: a health and stamina bar at the bottom left, a set of icons indicating abilities or items on the left side, and a circular icon at the bottom right, possibly representing a map or special ability. Additionally, there is a text hint on the right side of the screen showing \"Will\" with a +4 and x13, likely indicating a resource or currency gained during gameplay."
