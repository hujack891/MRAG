The character is wearing a fur garment and beads, and there is a caption at the bottom that reads, \"I beg you, sir, to take my fur and wear my form. Confront him and calm my sorrowful heart.\" This scene is likely part of the Snow Fox questline in the game, where the player must obtain the Snow Fox Brush by interacting with this character's body near a shrine in the Forest of Felicity, located in the Valley of Ecstasy in The New West. The Snow Fox Brush is a Curios item that enhances the duration of Transformation Spells when equipped."
