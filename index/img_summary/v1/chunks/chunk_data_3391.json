She can lash out with her appendages, which will subtly shift into long blades but also give you a clue as to where her main attacks will come from. As you might expect, you'll also have to deal with dodging both poison and webbing, making mobility key to your survival.\n\nThe good news is this phase doesn't last forever, but you will need to survive it for about 30 seconds, so you should also consider utilizing Immobilize to trap her in place, or even a Transformation Spell to offload the damage onto a different form.\n\nHer eyes will stop glowing after you've been mesmerized once, so once the room is back to normal, continue to dodge her projectiles and get your hits in after her violent stabs and slam attacks.\n\nWhen the queen of spiders finally falls to your assault, she'll beat a hasty retreat to return to wherever she's hidden the Sage's Relic. You'll need to follow quickly, because a literal spider army will appear to give chase!\n\nViolet Spider",

The on-screen interface indicates that Wukong has just acquired a \"Spider Leg\" material, along with \"Will\" and \"Refined Iron Sand\" resources. This image likely represents a moment after a battle or significant encounter within the cave, emphasizing the collection of materials and resources following the fight with the Violet Spider."
