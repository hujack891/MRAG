    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character is engaged in combat with a large enemy named \"Yellow Wind Sage.\" The environment is a barren, rocky landscape with a sandy ground. The player character is wielding a staff and appears to be preparing for an attack. There are visual effects indicating wind or energy swirling around the enemy. The user interface shows the player's health bar at the bottom left, which is partially depleted, and several ability icons on both sides of the screen. The bottom right corner displays additional icons, possibly for items or skills, along with a mini-map. The presence of these elements suggests a focus on strategic combat and resource management."
