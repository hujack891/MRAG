    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a player character is engaged in combat with an enemy. The enemy appears to be a large, grotesque creature with a yellowish hue, and the character is attacking it with a melee weapon. Sparks and visual effects suggest an ongoing battle. A health bar above the enemy indicates its remaining health. The environment is a dimly lit, rustic interior with wooden beams and a lit torch providing some illumination. A treasure chest is highlighted with a red dashed circle, suggesting it is an important or interactable object. The user interface at the bottom left shows the player's health and mana bars, along with several ability icons, indicating available skills or items."
