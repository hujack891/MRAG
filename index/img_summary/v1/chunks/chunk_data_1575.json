    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy, mountainous environment. A character wearing a yellow robe and a wide-brimmed hat stands on a wooden platform covered in snow, overlooking a frozen lake. The character holds a staff, suggesting they may have magical or combat abilities. In front of the character is a glowing object on a pedestal, possibly an interactive element or a checkpoint. The background features towering snow-covered mountains, adding to the cold and isolated atmosphere. There are no visible enemies or UI components such as health bars or icons, focusing the player's attention on the environment and the glowing object."
