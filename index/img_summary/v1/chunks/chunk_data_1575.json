This visual likely serves as a gameplay hint, directing players to climb or navigate toward the ledge as part of the progression in Chapter 3 of *Black Myth: Wukong*. The context suggests this is part of the path leading to the boss or item required to unlock the purple magic seals on prison doors in the Pagoda Realm."
