    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a rugged, desert-like environment with dry, rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. In the foreground, a character or creature is partially visible, possibly engaging in combat. The user interface displays two attack options on the left: a \"Light Attack\" called \"Earth Shatter\" that strikes the enemy three times, and a \"Heavy Attack\" called \"Mountain Splitter\" that involves dashing forward with full force, with the ability to charge for a longer dash. At the bottom left, there is a health or stamina bar, and in the bottom right corner, there are icons that might represent abilities or status effects. These elements suggest the player is in a combat scenario, with options to execute different attack strategies."
