    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character, armed with a long staff, is navigating a rocky and grassy terrain. The environment is rugged, with large rocks and sparse vegetation. In the background, there is a large stone head partially buried in the ground, with glowing eyes suggesting it might be significant to the gameplay. The user interface includes several elements: a health bar at the bottom left, a set of icons indicating available abilities or items, and additional icons at the bottom right representing character stats or skills.
