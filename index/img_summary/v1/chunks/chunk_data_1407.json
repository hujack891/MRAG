    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic scene from a video game where a character, possibly the player, is engaged in combat with a large dragon-like creature amidst a snowy, mountainous environment. The character is shown in a dynamic pose, seemingly dodging or preparing to attack, with a staff in hand. The creature is emitting a powerful lightning attack, indicated by the bright, jagged lines of electricity. The user interface (UI) displays various elements: a health bar at the bottom center labeled \"Kang Jin Loong,\" suggesting the name of the enemy or boss. On the bottom left, there are icons for different abilities or items, and on the bottom right, additional ability icons are visible, with button prompts indicating controls. The setting and UI components suggest a high-stakes boss battle requiring strategic movement and ability usage."
