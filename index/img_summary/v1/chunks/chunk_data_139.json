    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene from a video game set in a snowy mountain environment. Two characters are engaged in battle: one wearing dark armor wielding a glowing staff, and the other, named Kang Jin-Sim, is dressed in red robes and appears to be casting a spell with a blue aura surrounding them. The UI displays various elements including health bars at the bottom, with Kang Jin-Sim's health bar visible, indicating the player's current target. On the left side, there are icons representing different abilities or items, while the right side shows additional icons likely related to combat actions or skills, each assigned to specific controller buttons (RT). The scene is dynamic, with visual effects such as sparks and debris adding intensity to the battle."
