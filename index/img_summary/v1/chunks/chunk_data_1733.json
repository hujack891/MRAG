    "img_summary": "The image displays a game menu focused on the \"Equipment\" section, specifically showcasing an epic item called \"Non-Able.\" This item has a low Qi cost and grants the ability \"Seasoned Punch,\" which allows the player to take the form of Non-Able and unleash a series of punches and kicks. Different phases of light attacks enable various moves. The equipped effect of this item slightly increases attack, critical hit chance, and critical damage but significantly reduces maximum mana. The menu includes a list of spirits on the left, each represented by an icon, and the player's stats on the right, including health, mana, attack power, and various percentages related to abilities. The player can equip the item by pressing \"E\" and use it in combat by pressing \"F.\" A demo video of the ability is available for viewing, indicated by a small screen showing gameplay."
