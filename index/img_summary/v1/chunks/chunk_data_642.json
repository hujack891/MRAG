    "img_summary": "The image shows a blue, double-gourd-shaped object with a red cloth or paper protruding from the top. This object appears to be a Molotov cocktail or similar explosive device, commonly used in video games as a throwable weapon. It is likely used to deal area damage to enemies or to ignite flammable objects in the environment. The lack of additional elements such as characters, enemies, or UI components suggests that the focus is solely on this item, indicating its importance or utility in the gameplay."
