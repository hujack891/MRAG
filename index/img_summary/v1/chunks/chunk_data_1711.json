    "img_summary": "The image displays a video game interface focused on the \"Equipment\" menu, specifically highlighting the \"Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\" spirit. This spirit is classified as \"Epic\" and has a high Qi cost. Its ability, \"Emergence,\" allows the player to take the form of Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai, which causes lingzhi to sprout and explode, dealing poison damage to nearby foes. The spirit also has an equipped effect that moderately reduces the mana cost of mysticism spells. The interface shows various spirits available for selection, and the player can equip the highlighted spirit by pressing 'E'. The screen also includes character stats such as health, mana, and other attributes."
