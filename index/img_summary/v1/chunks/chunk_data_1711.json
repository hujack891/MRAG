    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game showing the equipment menu, specifically focusing on a spirit called \"Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai,\" classified as Epic. The description explains that this spirit allows the player to take its form, causing poison damage to nearby foes when activated. The \"Qi Cost\" for using this ability is high. The equipped effect moderately reduces the mana cost of mysticism spells. The interface includes a list of spirits on the left, with icons and names, and a detailed description of the selected spirit in the center. On the right, there are character stats such as health, mana, and other attributes. The top of the screen shows options like Self-Advance, Relics, Inventory, Journal, and Settings, along with currency and a spirit count. There is a small demo video in the center-right showing the spirit in action, with a prompt to close it using the 'F' key."
