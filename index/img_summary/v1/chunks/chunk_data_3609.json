    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic moment from the Yaksha King boss fight in *Black Myth: Wukong*. It showcases the Yaksha King executing a powerful attack with a glowing blade, creating a fiery, extended arc across the battlefield. This visual aligns with the preceding text, which describes the boss switching to a single blade and performing wide-reaching attacks in chains of three, accompanied by verbal cues like \"Merciless\" or \"Sheathless.\" The dark, volcanic environment and intense visual effects emphasize the challenge and danger of this final Chapter 5 encounter."
