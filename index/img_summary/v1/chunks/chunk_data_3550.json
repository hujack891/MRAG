A glowing marker surrounded by a red dashed circle highlights a specific location, and a red arrow points toward a pathway leading deeper into the area. This visual likely serves as a guide for players to identify a key point of interest or progression, such as a Meditation Spot (\"The Relief\") mentioned in the preceding text. The image complements the walkthrough by providing spatial context for navigating the terrain."
