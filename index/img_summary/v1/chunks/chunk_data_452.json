    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene from a video game, featuring a large enemy named \"Tiger Vanguard\" in a rocky, arid environment. The enemy is a tiger-like creature wielding a spear, and it appears to be in the midst of attacking the player character, who is equipped with a staff. The user interface displays various elements: a health bar for the Tiger Vanguard at the bottom center, indicating the enemy's remaining health; the player's health and stamina bars at the bottom left; and several icons representing abilities or items on the left and right sides of the screen. These UI components suggest the player has access to different skills or consumables during the battle."
