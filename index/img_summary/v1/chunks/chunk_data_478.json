    "img_summary": "The image displays an equipment menu from a video game, focusing on a legendary item called \"Wind Tamer.\" This item has a high Qi cost and, when activated, significantly increases damage reduction and grants immunity to strong winds for a short duration, making it effective against specific enemies. The activation effect can be triggered in combat by pressing certain buttons. The item also provides a slight increase in damage reduction when equipped. The UI shows the player's current stats, including health, attack, defense, and other attributes, along with a currency count of 39,905 and a Qi level of 3. The interface allows the player to equip the item, watch a demo, or return to the previous menu."
