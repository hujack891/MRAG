    "img_summary": "The image displays a section of a video game interface focused on equipment management. The highlighted item is a legendary vessel called \"Wind Tamer,\" which has a high Qi cost. Its activation effect significantly increases damage reduction for a short period and provides immunity to strong winds, making it effective against certain enemies. In combat, players can activate this effect by pressing the RT and Y buttons. When equipped, the item slightly increases damage reduction. The interface also shows various player stats, including health, attack, defense, and other attributes, along with options to watch a demo, equip the item, view details, examine, or return."
