    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene from a video game, featuring a player character engaged in battle with an enemy named \"Non-Pure.\" The environment is a dimly lit, stone-floored room with bright light streaming in from an opening, creating strong contrasts. The player character is on the left, seemingly knocked down or in a vulnerable position, while the enemy on the right wields a large axe. The user interface displays various elements: a health bar at the bottom left, which is nearly depleted, and several ability or item icons on both sides of the screen, indicating available actions or items. The enemy's health bar, labeled \"Non-Pure,\" is prominently displayed at the bottom center, suggesting a boss or significant enemy encounter."
