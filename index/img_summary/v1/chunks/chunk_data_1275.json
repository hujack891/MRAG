    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character in ornate armor, holding a staff, standing on a rocky path in a snowy environment. The character is facing a large, stone statue of a human head, which appears to be part of a larger, broken structure. The environment includes detailed stone textures and snow-covered surfaces, suggesting a cold, mountainous setting. There are no visible UI components or text hints in the image, focusing solely on the character and the surrounding environment. The scene may be relevant to exploration or puzzle-solving aspects of the game, given the presence of the statue and the intricate design of the character's attire."
