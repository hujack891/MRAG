The character wields a staff and moves cautiously through a rocky snowfield, aligning with the preceding text's description of an area filled with Frozen Corpses and challenging visibility due to snowy winds. A glowing marker in the distance (circled in red) suggests a point of interest or progression path. The image emphasizes exploration and the need for careful navigation in this treacherous environment."
