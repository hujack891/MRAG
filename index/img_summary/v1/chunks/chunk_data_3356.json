    "img_summary": "The image depicts a tense moment from the boss fight against Zhu Bajie during the \"Second Encounter\" in *Black Myth: Wukong*, as outlined in the \"Webbed Hollow - Lower Hollow Walkthrough.\" Zhu Bajie, a pig-like character, is shown mid-attack in a large muddy battlefield surrounded by rocky terrain. The player character, armed with a glowing staff, appears to be struggling against Zhu Bajie's powerful moves, emphasizing the difficulty of the encounter. The on-screen dialogue, \"If there's no joy for me, then there's no joy for anyone!\" reflects Zhu Bajie's aggressive and despair-driven demeanor, aligning with the narrative's description of his home-field advantage and challenging combat style."
