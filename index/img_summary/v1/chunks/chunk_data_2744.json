    "img_summary": "The image depicts the Supreme Celestial Inspector, a winged boss character from *Black Myth: Wukong*, hovering in a rocky clearing surrounded by chains and natural terrain. This scene aligns with the narrative in Chapter 6, where players encounter the Inspector as part of their ascent to the mountain's peak. The Inspector is airborne, emphasizing its use of aerial attacks and projectiles, as described in the preceding text. The environment reflects the game's atmospheric design, with rugged cliffs and shadows enhancing the tension of the encounter."
