The character is carrying a long staff and is dressed in a feathered outfit. Above the structure, a large creature is visible, surrounded by dust or smoke. The game interface displays various icons and meters, including health and stamina bars, and the word \"Will\" with a count of 338. The environment is rugged, with barren trees and a large stone statue resembling a mythical creature."
