    "img_summary": "The image is from a video game interface showing the \"Equipment\" menu, specifically focusing on a rare item called \"Poisestone.\" This item has a low Qi cost and a special ability called \"Strike at Heart,\" which allows the player to leap up and kick an enemy in the chest. If the kick misses, a ground slam follows, damaging nearby foes. The item is equipped by pressing 'F' in combat. The equipped effect moderately increases the damage of jump light attacks and reduces the stamina cost of sprinting. The menu also displays a list of spirits on the left, with one highlighted, and player stats on the right, including health, attack, and defense values. The top menu options include Self-Advance, Relics, Inventory, Journal, and Settings."
