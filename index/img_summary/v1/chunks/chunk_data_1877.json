    "img_summary": "The image displays a section of a video game interface focused on equipment selection, specifically highlighting a rare item called \"Poisestone.\" This item has a low Qi cost and provides the ability \"Strike at Heart,\" which allows the player to leap up and kick an enemy in the chest. Even if the kick misses, the impact on the ground can damage nearby foes. The item is equipped by pressing 'F' during combat. Additionally, it moderately increases the damage of Jump Light Attacks and reduces the stamina cost of sprinting. The interface also shows various spirits available for selection and detailed player stats on the right side."
