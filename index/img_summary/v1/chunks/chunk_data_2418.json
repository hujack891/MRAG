    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a dark, rocky cave environment. The main character, positioned in the foreground, is holding a glowing red orb, suggesting a magical or combat ability. Above the character, an enemy creature is visible, appearing ghostly or undead, indicating a potential threat. The user interface displays several elements: on the bottom left, there are icons for abilities or items, with one highlighted; a health bar is shown at the bottom center, with a small portion depleted; and in the top right corner, a numerical value of +105 and 82, possibly indicating points or currency. The environment is dimly lit, with some glowing elements in the background, adding to the eerie atmosphere."
