    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy forest environment. The central focus is on a large humanoid enemy with a wooden beam strapped to its back, kneeling on the ground. The enemy is being attacked, as indicated by the fiery visual effect on its head. The user interface (UI) shows various elements: a health bar at the bottom center with blue and red segments, suggesting player health and possibly stamina or another resource. There are hexagonal icons on the left and right sides of the screen, likely representing abilities or items, with labels such as \"RT\" and \"LT\" indicating button prompts for actions. In the bottom right corner, there are circular icons, one with red dots, possibly indicating the player's health status or a special ability.
