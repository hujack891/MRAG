A character wearing a red cloak is seen from behind, walking through the snow while holding a long staff. The character appears to be approaching another figure in the distance, who is partially obscured by the snowy landscape. The game's interface shows various icons on both sides of the screen, indicating possible actions or abilities. The bottom left corner displays a health or stamina bar, while the bottom right corner shows icons that might represent different skills or powers. Additionally, the word \"Will\" is visible on the right side of the screen, with a count of 84, possibly indicating a resource or currency within the game."
