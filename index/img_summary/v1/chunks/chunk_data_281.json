    "img_summary": "The image shows a third-person perspective of a character in a video game, wielding a large staff-like weapon, running towards a glowing object highlighted with a red circle. The environment is a dimly lit, forested area with lush greenery and large stone structures. The user interface displays various elements: on the bottom left, there are icons for different abilities or items, and a health bar with a white orb and blue and beige segments. On the bottom right, there are additional icons, possibly representing skills or actions, with button prompts labeled \"RT\" and \"LT.\" The glowing object ahead seems to be a point of interest, possibly indicating an objective or collectible item."
