This scene is likely from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from Chapter 4, \"Secrets,\" under the section \"Daoist Mi and the Snake Lady - Purple Cloud Mountain.\" The courtyard appears to be part of the setting described in the preceding text, where players encounter the Scorpionlord near the Deity's Abode Keeper's Shrine. The image serves to illustrate the environment and atmosphere of this part of the game."
