    "img_summary": "The image depicts a tense moment from the **Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Buddha's Right Hand** section of the game *Black Myth: Wukong*. The player character, armed with a glowing staff, faces off against a large, grotesque creature with spider-like limbs in a narrow, dimly lit cave hallway. The creature, identified as \"Buddha's Right Hand,\" looms menacingly, blocking the path ahead. The fight occurs in a confined space, emphasizing the need for strategic movement and targeting both the creature's hand and head. The image visually reinforces the preceding text's description of the unorthodox and challenging nature of this miniboss encounter."
