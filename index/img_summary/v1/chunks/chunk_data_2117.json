The enemy has glowing blue hands and a visible health bar above its head. The player character is wielding a weapon that emits sparks and is positioned in a defensive stance. The interface displays various items and abilities available to the player, including \"Evil Repelling Medicament,\" \"Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets,\" \"Antimiasma Powder,\" and \"Longevity Decoction,\" each with a numerical count indicating their quantity. Additionally, there are abilities labeled \"Rock Solid,\" \"Immobilize,\" \"Umbral Abyss,\" and \"A Pluck of Many,\" with corresponding button prompts for activation. The environment appears to be a stone courtyard with a building in the background."
