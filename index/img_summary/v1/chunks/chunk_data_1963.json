    "img_summary": "The image displays a video game interface focused on the \"Scorpion Prince\" spirit, categorized as a rare item in the player's equipment menu. The spirit's ability, \"Deathsting,\" allows the player to transform into a Scorpion Guai, using its tail to pierce enemies and inflict poison damage in a small area. Foes within this area receive increased damage. The equipped effect moderately boosts poison damage. The interface also shows various other spirits available for selection, and the player's stats are visible on the right side of the screen. The option to equip the Scorpion Prince is highlighted, and a demo of the ability can be watched."
