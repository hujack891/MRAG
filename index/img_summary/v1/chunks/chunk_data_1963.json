    "img_summary": "The image displays the equipment menu from a video game, focusing on a spirit called \"Scorpion Prince,\" classified as rare with a high Qi cost. The ability \"Deathsting\" allows the player to transform into a Scorpion Guai, using its tail to inflict poison damage in a small area, affecting enemies within the vicinity. The equipped effect moderately increases poison damage. The UI includes options for self-advancement, relics, inventory, journal, and settings. The player's stats are shown on the right, including health, attack power, and various resistances. The player can press 'F' to use the ability in combat and 'E' to equip it.
