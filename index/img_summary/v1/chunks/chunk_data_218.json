The character is holding a staff and appears to be wearing a red outfit. An arrow points to a significant in-game object, a stone statue or shrine, suggesting it may be important for the player's progression or interaction. The user interface includes health bars at the bottom left, indicating the player's health status, and several icons on both sides of the screen, likely representing abilities or items.
