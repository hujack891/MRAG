    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a rocky, canyon-like environment. A character wearing a yellow cloak is seen carrying another character, possibly unconscious, across a narrow wooden bridge suspended by chains. To the left, a blue-skinned enemy or creature is crouched near a rock formation, suggesting potential danger or a stealth element. The user interface at the bottom left shows a health bar with a white flask icon, indicating the player's health status. Additional UI elements include circular icons, likely representing abilities or items, and a silhouette of a character in the bottom right corner, possibly indicating the player's current status or action. The environment and characters suggest a focus on navigation and possibly combat or stealth gameplay."
