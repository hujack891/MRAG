    "img_summary": "The image depicts the boss fight against *The Duskveil* in *Black Myth: Wukong*, set against a haunting, blood-red backdrop with twisted vines and rocky terrain. The undead, rooster-like creature is shown mid-combat, emphasizing its eerie and disfigured appearance. The player character is visible in the foreground, with the boss's health bar displayed, indicating the intensity of the encounter. This scene aligns with the guide's description of *The Duskveil's* second phase, where a Blood Moon transforms the atmosphere and the boss gains new abilities, including wielding a skeletal sword. The image visually reinforces the eerie and challenging nature of this optional boss fight."
