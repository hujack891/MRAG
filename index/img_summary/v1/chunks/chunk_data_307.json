    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character is interacting with a large, ornate chest, suggesting a potential loot or treasure acquisition. The environment appears to be a dimly lit cave or dungeon, with rocky textures and shadows. In the lower left corner, there is a user interface displaying a health bar, which is partially depleted, indicating the player's current health status. Next to the health bar are several icons, likely representing abilities or items available to the player. In the lower right corner, additional icons are visible, possibly indicating other gameplay elements such as inventory or skills. The presence of these UI components suggests the player is in a strategic or exploration phase of the game."
