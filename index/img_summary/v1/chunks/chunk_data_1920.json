The player character is wielding a weapon with a fiery effect. On the left side of the screen, there are instructions for different attack moves: \"Light Attack 'Moon Dance',\" \"Heavy Attack 'Moon Chase',\" and a combination move involving a dodge followed by a heavy attack. The bottom of the screen displays a health or stamina bar with a decorative design. The environment is a rocky, desert-like terrain with a set of stone steps in the background."
