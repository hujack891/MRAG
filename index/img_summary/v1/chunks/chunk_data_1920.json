    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene from a video game set in a desert-like environment with rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. A character, wielding a fiery weapon, is engaged in battle with a large, menacing enemy that has a dark, spiky appearance. The enemy has a visible health bar above it, indicating its current health status. On the left side of the screen, there are instructions for different attack moves: \"Light Attack 'Moon Dance'\" using the X button, \"Heavy Attack 'Moon Chase'\" using the Y button, and a combination move \"Follow Dodge with Heavy Attack\" using the B and Y buttons. These moves suggest a focus on building up attack strategies and performing powerful maneuvers. At the bottom of the screen, a UI component displays the player's health or energy bar, alongside an icon that may represent the player's character or a special ability."
