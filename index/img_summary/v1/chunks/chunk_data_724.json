On the left side, there are instructions for three different attacks: \"Earth Shatter\" (light attack), \"Mountain Splitter\" (heavy attack), and \"Rockfall\" (spell). Each attack has specific actions and effects, such as striking enemies or causing area damage. The UI elements include a health bar at the bottom, indicating the player's current health status, and icons on the right that likely represent abilities or items. The environment features a large, ornate stone structure, and the presence of debris suggests active combat."
