This image is located under the \"Height of Ember\" section, in the sub-section \"Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones.\" The preceding text suggests that players should follow the path to the left towards the cave, where they will find a green Wisp to collect before entering. The image likely serves to visually guide players on what to expect as they approach and enter the cave."
