Finding opportunities to get your own attacks in can be difficult, but you'll need to resist the urge to jump in too early or you'll be hit and staggered multiple times.\nGiven his long sweeping swings, having backup from A Pluck of Many or Spirits that summon other allies won't work as well as they'll tend to get hit even if he's focusing all his attention on you.\n\nTo make matters worse, Non-Pure also has a large gauntlet that he can periodically imbue with deflecting power, making him even harder to damage when he's not unleashing combos.
