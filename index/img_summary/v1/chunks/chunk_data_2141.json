The highlighted Spirit, Non-Able, offers the \"Seasoned Punch\" ability, allowing the player to take Non-Able's form and execute a series of punches and kicks. This Spirit power slightly increases Attack, Critical Hit Chance, and Critical Damage but significantly reduces Maximum Mana, making it a situational choice depending on the player's style. The image serves to illustrate the details and effects of Non-Able's Spirit within the game's equipment menu."
