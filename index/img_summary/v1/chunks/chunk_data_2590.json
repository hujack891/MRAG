The visible health bar and combat interface suggest the player is actively engaged in the fight, likely during the Shigandang's shockwave attack described in the preceding text. This attack involves the boss slamming down on all fours, creating a powerful arena-wide explosion. The image serves to illustrate the scale and ferocity of the Shigandang, emphasizing the need for strategic positioning and timing to avoid damage."
