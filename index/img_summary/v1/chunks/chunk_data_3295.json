These weapons boost your damage, critical hit chance, and sometimes they have a unique perk that can change how you approach combat. However, each new weapon will require you to defeat one, or several, of the dozens of Black Myth: Wukong bosses scattered across the game’s chapters.\nMost compulsory bosses will unlock a new piece of gear like a weapon, but you will often need to kill an optional boss in a side area to get the right crafting materials to craft the weapon in question. This guide will take you through all the weapons in the game, their stats, unique effects, and where they can be found.\n## Black Myth: Wukong Weapons Locations\nBelow, you can find a list of all the weapons in the game, how you can unlock them. Clicking on each individual link, will take you to a dedicated page on how to obtain that weapon in more detail. You can also head our Walkthrough for the game. You can also check each one off as you unlock them.\nChapter 1: Black Cloud, Red Fire Map\nWeapon | Damage | Critical Hit Chance/Defense | Unique Effect | Unlock Requirement | Crafting Ingredients Needed | Collected\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---\n• 4 Refined Iron Sand\n• 8 Yaoguai Core\n• 21,000 Will | Rat Sage Staff",
