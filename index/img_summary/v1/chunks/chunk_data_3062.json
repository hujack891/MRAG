It shows the protagonist engaged in a battle with the Yaoguai Chief miniboss, Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang, in a snowy, forested area. The boss, a large frog-like creature, is imbued with ice powers, making the environment and the fight challenging due to freezing conditions. The player character is equipped with fiery weapons, likely to counteract the frost attacks. This image illustrates the intense and strategic nature of the boss fight, emphasizing the need for specific items and tactics to succeed."
