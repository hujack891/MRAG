    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game, displaying the equipment menu focused on selecting a spirit called \"Falcon Hermit.\" This spirit is classified as rare and has a high Qi cost. The ability \"Frosty Wind\" allows the player to take the form of Falcon Hermit, summoning a gust of wind that deals frost damage or freezes enemies with repeated hits. The equipped effect moderately increases frost damage. The interface shows a list of spirits on the left, with various icons representing different spirits. On the right, player stats are visible, including health, attack, and defense values. The top menu includes options like Self-Advance, Relics, Inventory, Journal, and Settings. The player can equip the spirit by pressing 'E' and use it in combat by pressing 'F'. A small demo video is also available for preview."
