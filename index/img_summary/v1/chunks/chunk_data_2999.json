The central character, likely the protagonist, stands in front of a large, intricate statue, with a defeated enemy, possibly the Yellow-Robed Square (the Drunken Boar), seated nearby. The text overlay indicates a dialogue where the Drunken Boar expresses a craving for Jade Lotus, hinting at a quest or task related to finding this item. This image serves to illustrate the narrative progression and the environment within the secret area where players can encounter the \"Tiger Vanguard\" miniboss."
