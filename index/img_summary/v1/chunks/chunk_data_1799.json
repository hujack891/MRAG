    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character, equipped with a large weapon, is positioned on a wooden platform in a rocky environment. The character appears to be performing an action, possibly an attack or a spell, as indicated by the swirling visual effects and particles surrounding them. In the background, an enemy is visible, standing on a ledge across a gap. The user interface displays various elements: on the bottom left, there are hexagonal icons likely representing abilities or items, along with a health bar and another bar beneath it. On the bottom right, additional icons suggest different abilities or actions, with labels indicating button prompts (RT, LT, etc.). The environment is characterized by reddish rock formations, suggesting a canyon or cave-like setting."
