    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character is navigating a rocky, barren landscape. The character is holding a staff and appears to be running towards a dark cave or passageway, indicated by a red arrow. The environment is rugged, with dry grass and a lit brazier on the left side, suggesting a path or checkpoint. The user interface (UI) includes various icons on the bottom left and right corners, likely representing abilities or items, with some mapped to controller buttons (e.g., RT, LT). Health or stamina bars are visible at the bottom, indicating the character's current status. The scene suggests exploration or a quest objective in a potentially dangerous area."
