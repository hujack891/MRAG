    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character, possibly the player, is facing a massive, blurred creature in a desert-like environment. The creature is causing a sandstorm, indicated by the swirling dust and debris. The user interface (UI) includes a health bar at the bottom left, showing the player's health status, and several ability icons on both sides of the screen. The name \"Fuban\" is displayed above a large health bar at the bottom center, suggesting this is a boss fight. The UI also shows button prompts for abilities or actions, labeled \"RT,\" indicating controls for console gameplay. The environment is open and arid, with rocky formations in the background."
