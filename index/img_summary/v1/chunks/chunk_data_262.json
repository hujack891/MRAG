The player character is wielding a weapon and is positioned in the foreground, facing the enemy. The enemy appears to be a giant creature with glowing blue elements, possibly indicating a magical or powerful attack. The user interface displays various icons on the left and right sides, likely representing abilities or items available to the player. At the bottom, there is a health bar for the player and a separate health bar for the enemy, \"Black Loong,\" indicating the ongoing battle's status. The presence of action prompts, such as \"RT\" and \"LT,\" suggests that the player can perform specific actions or attacks during the fight."
