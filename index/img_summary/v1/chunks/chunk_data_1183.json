    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a game walkthrough titled \"The Forest of Wolves.\" It shows a character engaged in combat with a wolf-like enemy in a forest setting. The character appears to be performing a heavy attack, as indicated by the on-screen prompt. This image likely illustrates a moment where the player must defeat wolf enemies while navigating through the forest, as described in the preceding text. The context suggests that this encounter occurs early in the game, before the player collects a crafting material called Aged Ginseng."
