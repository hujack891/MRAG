Two items are highlighted: \"Cat Eye Beads,\" which slightly increase critical hit chance, and \"Agate Jar,\" which moderately increases defense. The Agate Jar is currently selected, displaying its detailed view on the right side of the screen. The player's stats are visible on the right, showing various attributes such as health, attack, and defense, with some values altered by the Agate Jar's effect.
