    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a dense, misty forest environment. A character, wearing a straw hat and holding a staff, stands on a wooden bridge. The character appears to be looking towards the direction indicated by a large red arrow, which points deeper into the forest, suggesting a path or area of interest. The environment is lush with greenery, rocks, and large trees, creating a sense of mystery and exploration. There are no visible UI components or text hints in the image. The arrow serves as a guide for players to follow or investigate further into the forest."
