    "img_summary": "The image shows an in-game item from a video game, featuring a spiked, metallic object with two curved blades protruding from it. The object is mounted on a twisted, wooden base. This item likely serves as a weapon or a collectible within the game, potentially offering unique abilities or enhancements to the player. The design suggests it may be used for combat purposes, given the sharp blades. There are no visible UI components or text hints in the image to provide further context."
