    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character, holding a staff-like weapon, is engaged in combat with two enemies in a dark, rocky environment. The character is positioned in the foreground, facing the enemies. One enemy is a humanoid figure with glowing blue energy and a red health bar above its head, indicating it is an opponent. The second enemy is a skeletal creature wielding a spear. The game interface shows various icons and bars at the bottom of the screen, likely representing health, abilities, and other game mechanics. The setting is dimly lit, with small flames scattered across the ground."
