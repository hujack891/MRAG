    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where the player character is standing at the entrance of a cave, looking out into a snowy, rocky landscape. The character is wearing a hat and carrying a sword on their back. Two red circular icons are visible, likely indicating points of interest or targets. One icon is near the cave entrance, and the other is further out in the open area, where an enemy or creature is visible. The environment is detailed with rocky textures and sparse vegetation, suggesting a rugged terrain. The icons may serve as markers for the player to focus on specific areas or enemies during gameplay."
