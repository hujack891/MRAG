    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game, showing a character in a cave-like environment. The character, dressed in a red outfit and holding a long staff, appears to be in a combat stance. In the background, there is a large stone statue of a seated figure, partially illuminated by the cave's lighting. Another character is engaged in combat near the statue, with a health bar visible above them. The user interface displays various icons and a health bar at the bottom, indicating gameplay elements such as health and abilities. An arrow points to the statue, possibly highlighting it as a point of interest."
