    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy forest environment in a video game, where a player character, dressed in red with glowing elements on their back, is facing an enemy in the distance. The enemy appears to be a large humanoid figure wielding a weapon. The user interface includes several key components: on the bottom left, there are icons for different abilities or items, with one labeled \"LB\" and others mapped to \"RT\" and \"LT\" buttons, suggesting controller inputs for actions. A health bar or stamina bar is visible at the bottom center, with a label \"Non-Able,\" possibly indicating a status effect or ability limitation. On the bottom right, additional ability icons are mapped to \"RT\" and \"LT\" buttons, with a circular map or radar. The scene suggests a combat scenario where the player must manage their abilities and resources effectively."
