He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).\nAs mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses.\n\nIf he instead lets his sword float around the talismans to become imbued with lightning, be ready for him to toss the sword directly at you with quick speed. You'll have a moment to close the distance and get some hits in, but be ready when you see him raise his arms wide and begin to spin around as he advances, as his sword will reappear in his hand to perform two quick downward slashes, and then imbue his sword for a final slash (but you can deflect the two earlier slashes to stagger him).",
