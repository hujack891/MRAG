    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character is engaged in combat, wielding a flaming weapon against a wooden barricade. The environment is dark and eerie, featuring a cobweb-covered structure in the background, suggesting a haunted or abandoned setting. The user interface displays several elements: a health bar at the bottom left, icons for abilities or items, and a circular gauge likely indicating stamina or energy. On the right, there is text showing \"Will\" with a count of 19, possibly representing a resource or currency. A red circular marker highlights an area on the building, potentially indicating an objective or point of interest."
