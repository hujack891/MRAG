    "img_summary": "The image shows the equipment menu from a video game, highlighting the \"Fireproof Mantle,\" a legendary item. The mantle has a high Qi cost and provides burn immunity and increasing focus for a short duration after activation, making it effective in certain environments and against specific enemies. In combat, players can activate it by pressing specific buttons. The equipped effect significantly increases burn resistance and grants immunity to scorch damage from lava-covered areas. The UI displays various stats such as health, stamina, and other attributes, alongside the player's currency and item count. A quote at the bottom adds narrative context to the item."
