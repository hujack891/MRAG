    "img_summary": "The image displays a menu screen from a video game, focusing on the \"Set Spells\" section under \"Transformations.\" It highlights a specific spell or ability called \"Ashen Slumber,\" which requires a high might cost. The description explains that this ability allows the player to transform into a rat guai, enabling them to slash at enemies while emitting flames, causing the \"Scorch Bane\" effect. It emphasizes the need to build focus before transformation, which can be converted for use afterward. The interface includes options to view talent details and indicates the spell is \"Awakened.\" Navigation options are shown at the bottom with \"Soak In\" and \"Return\" commands."
