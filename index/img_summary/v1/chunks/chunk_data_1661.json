    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game set in a snowy environment. A character, dressed in fur clothing and holding a spear, stands on a snow-covered rocky terrain, facing a frozen river. Across the river, there are two humanoid creatures on a rocky area, and a wooden structure is visible in the background. A red dashed circle highlights a glowing object on the ground, suggesting it is an item of interest. The game's interface displays various icons and a health bar at the bottom left corner, while the text \"Gentian x1\" appears on the right side, indicating the acquisition of an item named Gentian."
