    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark cave environment with a makeshift wooden bridge leading across a gap. The bridge appears to be constructed from planks, suggesting a temporary or precarious crossing. A red arrow points towards a specific area beside the bridge, possibly indicating a point of interest or a path to follow. The surroundings are rocky, with stalagmites visible on the left and some web-like textures on the ground, hinting at potential spider activity. There is a bowl or circular object on the right side of the bridge, which could be an interactive element or a clue. The lighting is dim, creating a mysterious atmosphere typical of exploration or puzzle-solving scenarios in video games."
