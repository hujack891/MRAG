In the image, a character is shown standing in a rocky, forested area, with a prompt to \"Gather\" an item from the ground. This corresponds to the narrative where the monkey leaves behind the Skandha of Form for the player to collect. The image serves to illustrate the moment in the game when the player can pick up this key item."
