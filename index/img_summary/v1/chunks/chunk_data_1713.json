    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene in a snowy forest environment from a video game. The player character, dressed in red and wielding a sword, is engaged in battle with a large enemy who appears to be attacking with a powerful kick. The UI shows several key components: a health bar at the bottom left, indicating the player's health status; a set of icons on the left side, possibly representing abilities or items; and additional icons on the right side, which might be related to combat skills or magic. The text \"Non Able\" appears above the health bar, suggesting a status effect or condition affecting the player. The snowy landscape and trees provide a visually immersive setting for the encounter."
