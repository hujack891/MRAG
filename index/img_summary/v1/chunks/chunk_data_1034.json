A character, seen from behind, is holding a weapon and facing a large, creature-like enemy on a forest path. The enemy is highlighted with a red dashed circle, indicating it is a point of interest or target. In the bottom left corner, there is a health and stamina bar, suggesting the character's status. The bottom right corner displays an icon that likely represents an ability or action the character can perform. The forest is dense with greenery, and there are two lit torches in the background, adding to the atmosphere."
