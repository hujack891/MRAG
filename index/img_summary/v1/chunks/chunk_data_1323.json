    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark cave environment with rocky formations and stalactites. A character dressed in red and gold armor stands in the foreground, holding a weapon. The cave is dimly lit, with a bright light source visible in the distance, highlighted by a red arrow pointing towards it. The arrow suggests a direction to proceed or an area of interest within the cave. The overall atmosphere is mysterious and foreboding."
