    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a rocky canyon environment. A character, clad in dark armor and wielding a staff, stands near a lit brazier and a wooden chest, suggesting a point of interest or interaction. The user interface displays various icons and gauges: a health and stamina bar at the bottom left, and several ability or item icons along the bottom and right side of the screen. These UI elements indicate the character's current status and available actions. The environment is illuminated by the brazier's fire, casting light on the surroundings and highlighting the chest, which may contain valuable items or be part of a quest objective."
