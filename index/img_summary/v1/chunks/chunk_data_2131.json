    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character is observing an ancient mural or painting on a stone wall within a cave-like environment. The character is seen from behind, with a focus on their head and shoulders, and they appear to be holding a weapon or object that emits a fiery glow. The environment is dimly lit, with two visible torches providing illumination. The mural seems to contain faded images or symbols, possibly relevant to the game's lore or a puzzle. The setting suggests exploration or discovery within a dungeon or historical site."
