A character in armor, possibly the player character, stands in the foreground, looking towards a path marked by a red arrow. This path appears to lead towards a distant pagoda-like structure and a twisted tree on a cliff. The image is from the \"Fallen Furnace Crater\" section of the \"Field of Fire Walkthrough\" document for the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" It visually represents the treacherous environment the player must navigate to progress towards the Bull King, as described in the preceding text."
