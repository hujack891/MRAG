The red dashed circle highlights a specific area of interest, possibly indicating a hidden object, pathway, or point of interaction. This scene appears to follow the defeat of Captain Wise-Voice, as described in the preceding text, marking a moment when players can freely explore the area without the debuff caused by the bossâ€™s chant. The visual reinforces the narrative of post-battle exploration in the \"Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Captain Wise-Voice\" section of *The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm*."
