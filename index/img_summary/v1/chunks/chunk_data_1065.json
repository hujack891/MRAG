    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character is standing in a rocky, outdoor environment. The character is holding a staff and is facing a small structure made of wooden beams, partially obscured by shadows. A red arrow points towards this structure, suggesting it is a point of interest or a direction to follow. In the bottom left corner, the user interface displays several icons, likely representing abilities or items, along with health and stamina bars. The bottom right corner shows additional icons, possibly related to combat or character status. A small fire burns near the rocks, providing a source of light. The environment is detailed with grass and rocky formations, creating a natural and rugged setting."
