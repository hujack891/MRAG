Still, when it does get close enough to strike, a well-timed Rock Solid deflection can send it crashing to the ground, and is useful to have for this fight. It can also use frozen winds to deal chilling attacks you should be ready for, so have warming medicine on hand or consider equipping a Curio that reduces frostbite, and consider trying the Ring of Fire to warm yourself up.\n\nOnce you've gotten it on the ground for an extended period to dish out damage, be mindful not to get overconfident. If you see it hunch over and turn completely gold, it will use its own rock solid deflection to make your attack bounce off.\n\nListen for the sound cue of your attack being deflected, and it will quickly rise up and extend a bladed wing up in the air before slamming it down on you. You can turn the tables with your own deflection (though it will send you sliding back), or dodge to the side and bash it with a Spirit Attack.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game Black Myth Wukong, specifically the Apramana Bat miniboss fight. The player character is engaged in combat with the Apramana Bat, a large gold variant of lesser bats encountered earlier in Chapter 3. The setting is a snowy landscape with skeletal remains in the background, indicating the North Shore of Bitter Lake. The image illustrates the challenging nature of the fight, where the bat uses ranged flying attacks and frozen winds, requiring strategic deflections and the use of warming medicine or frostbite-reducing items. The encounter is part of an optional boss fight that offers rewards such as experience points and materials upon victory."
