The character is positioned in front of the chest, which is highlighted by a small, glowing dot indicating interaction. The user interface displays various icons on the left and right sides of the screen, likely representing abilities or items. On the bottom left, there is a health bar with blue and black segments, and a potion icon with a button prompt \"LB\" for use.
