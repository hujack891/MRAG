    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a dark, rocky cave environment. The central focus is on two characters engaged in combat. The player character, visible from behind, wields a staff and is dressed in elaborate armor with a distinctive headpiece. The enemy, facing the player, is a humanoid creature with a skeletal appearance, carrying a large shield. The user interface (UI) elements include a health bar and various icons at the bottom of the screen, indicating available abilities or items. These icons suggest options for combat or inventory management. The environment is littered with bones and skulls, adding to the ominous atmosphere of the scene."
