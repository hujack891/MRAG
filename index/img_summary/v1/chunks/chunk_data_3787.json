Zhu Bajie, now bewitched, is shown mid-combat wielding his signature 9-pointed rake in a dynamic attack. The player character is engaged in the fight, surrounded by glowing effects and petals, emphasizing the intensity of the encounter. This scene aligns with the guide's description of Zhu Bajie's unorthodox fighting style and dangerous rake attacks, highlighting the challenge of freeing him from the Crimson Spider's influence during the first encounter."
