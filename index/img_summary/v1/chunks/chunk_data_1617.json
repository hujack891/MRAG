    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene from a video game set in a snowy, stone-paved environment. A character, wearing red and gold armor, is engaged in a melee attack against an enemy lying on the ground. The enemy appears to be wearing fur clothing and is holding a spear. Above the enemy, a red health bar indicates their remaining health. The user interface displays several elements: a health and stamina bar at the bottom left, and various icons for abilities or items on both sides of the screen. These icons suggest available actions or resources, with button prompts labeled \"RT\" and \"LT\" for potential controls. The environment features snow-covered stone pathways and structures, contributing to the game's atmospheric setting."
