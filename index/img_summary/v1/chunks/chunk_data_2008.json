    "img_summary": "The image shows a video game equipment menu focused on headgear. The selected item is the \"Snout Mask,\" classified as rare with a defense value of 17. It has a unique effect where using a gourd temporarily increases attack, while refraining from using it for a longer duration moderately decreases attack. The character wearing the mask is displayed on the right side, and various stats are listed, including health, attack, and defense. The menu allows players to equip the mask and provides options to sort, view details, examine, or return. A quote is visible at the bottom of the screen."
