A character, possibly the player, is engaged in combat with an enemy, as indicated by the visible health bar above the enemy. The character is surrounded by sparks, suggesting an attack or special ability is being used. The user interface displays various elements: on the bottom left, there are icons representing abilities or items, each associated with a button prompt (RT); a health bar and possibly stamina or mana bars are visible.
