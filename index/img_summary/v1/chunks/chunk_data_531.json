    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a rustic, autumnal environment with rocky terrain and a traditional building in the background. The player character, equipped with a large weapon, is crouched and appears to be sneaking up on an enemy dressed in a yellow robe, who has a visible health bar above their head. Another enemy is marked with a red circle, indicating a potential threat or objective. The user interface displays various icons on the left and right sides of the screen, likely representing abilities or items, along with a health bar at the bottom center. The game seems to involve stealth and combat mechanics, as suggested by the player's posture and the presence of enemies."
