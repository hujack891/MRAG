She can lash out with her appendages, which will subtly shift into long blades but also give you a clue as to where her main attacks will come from. As you might expect, you'll also have to deal with dodging both poison and webbing, making mobility key to your survival.\n\nIf this happens, you'll suddenly be transported to an illusory realm where you're on a bed of webs instead of solid ground. This can get extremely bad as the more you move around, the more you'll be slowed until eventually you'll be exposed as you try and break free of the webbing.\n\nExpect the Violet Spider to absolutely take advantage of your vulnerability in these moments, attacking with both her talons and a large jump slam attack that even staggers her for a bit. You'll need to stand your ground and use Rock Solid to knock away her blasts if you're unable to dodge them in time.",
