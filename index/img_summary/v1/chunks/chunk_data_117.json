    "img_summary": "The image displays a skill tree interface from a video game, specifically focusing on the \"Cloud Step\" ability under the \"Alteration\" category. The skill tree shows interconnected nodes, indicating possible upgrades or related abilities. The \"Cloud Step\" ability is described as a mobility spell that creates a decoy and allows the player to disperse into mist for escape, making it useful for evading attacks or trapping enemies. It is active for 35 seconds and costs 30 points. Additionally, upon returning from the mist state, players can perform an \"Unveiling Strike\" to surprise opponents. The interface includes tabs for other categories like Foundation, Staff Stances, Mysticism, Strand, and Transformations, suggesting a comprehensive skill system. The UI also shows a small image of a character in an outdoor environment, possibly demonstrating the ability in action."
