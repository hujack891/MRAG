    "img_summary": "The image displays a game interface focused on the \"Equipment\" menu, specifically showcasing the \"Gore-Eye Daoist\" spirit, categorized as \"Epic\" with a high Qi cost. The spirit description highlights its ability, \"Raging Blood,\" which allows the player to take the form of the Gore-Eye Daoist, wielding a staff topped with a glowing toad to enhance attacks. The staff's glow boosts the player's attack temporarily. The equipped effect moderately increases maximum mana. The interface includes options to sort spirits, watch a demo, and equip the spirit. The UI also shows player stats like health, mana, and various attributes on the right side, with a demonstration image of gameplay in the top right corner."
