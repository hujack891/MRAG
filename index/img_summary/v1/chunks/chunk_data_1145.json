    "img_summary": "The image shows a character in a video game, dressed in a traditional, possibly Asian-inspired outfit, holding a long staff-like weapon. The character stands in a rocky, dimly lit environment, facing a dark entrance to a structure that resembles a temple or shrine. Two areas are highlighted with red dashed circles, indicating points of interest or potential interactive elements. One is located on the ground to the left, and the other near the entrance on the right. A small shrine with burning flames is visible on the right side, adding to the atmospheric setting. The image likely serves as a guide to highlight important locations or items within this game area."
