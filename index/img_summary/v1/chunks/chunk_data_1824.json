    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character is navigating a snowy, rocky environment, ascending a staircase towards a large statue. The character is equipped with a staff and appears to be casting or preparing a spell, indicated by the glowing effect around them. The user interface includes several elements: on the left, there are hexagonal icons representing different abilities or items, and a health bar with blue and brown segments. On the right, additional icons suggest various skills or actions, with button prompts labeled \"RT\" and \"LT\" for controller inputs.
