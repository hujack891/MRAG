Two items are highlighted: the \"Fine China Tea Bowl,\" which moderately increases stamina recovery rate, and the \"Wind Chime,\" which slightly increases movement speed. The interface shows a grid of curios obtained by the player, with various items depicted visually. The UI includes tabs for different sections like Self-Advance, Relics, Inventory, Journal, and Settings. Player stats are visible on the right, including health, stamina, and various attributes.
