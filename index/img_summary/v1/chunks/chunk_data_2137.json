This Yaoguai Chief hides in the Valley of Ecstasy, serving a penance alone above a nearby brook.\n* **Rewards:** Non-Able Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Cold Iron Leaves, Random Materials, 1847 Experience, 1182 Will\n## Where to Find Non-Able\nNon-Able is an optional boss, and sits alone in a large snowy field in the Valley of Ecstasy. You'll find him by heading down the hill from the main road in the Forest of Felicity and into the Brook of Bliss, and then cross the bridge and head up the hill past the Shrine.\n### Non-Able Miniboss Fight and Guide\nDon't mistake his subdued appearance for weakness, Non-Able is probably one of the toughest Yaoguai Chief bosses you'll face in Chapter 3. Unlike other enemies, he won't use any magic or ranged tricks on you, and trades it all in for overwhelming power and a mastery of martial arts that makes him an extremely challenging foe -- and that's before the restraints come off.\nIf you haven't made use of them in other fights, now is definitely the time to take advantage of all the medicinal pills and consumable buffs you can craft and use. Items like the Tiger Subduing Pellets to raise your attack and others that can raise your stamina or focus can all help out greatly, and you'll want every advantage on your side.\n\nHaving stamina in reserve is crucial for this phase, as Non-Able routinely flows into very long combo attacks that are hard to keep pace with. One attack will have him start with a shoulder check, and then expel energy from his raised palm. He'll quickly flow into a sweeping punch and two spinning kicks all in a row, which again is where moves like Cloud Step or Immobilize can help grant you some breathing room.\n\nExpect this fight to take you awhile to learn. For any chance of winning, you'll need to learn his first phase enough to the point you can power him down quickly before he can do much damage in return, and save the majority of your healing for phase two.",
