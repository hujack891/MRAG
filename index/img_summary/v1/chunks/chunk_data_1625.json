    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy, traditional Asian temple environment. A character, dressed in fur-like attire and wielding a weapon, stands in the foreground. The character is facing a red-circled object, possibly an item of interest, located near a stone monument and a tree. The user interface shows various elements: on the bottom left, there are icons for different abilities or items; a health bar is visible at the bottom center; and on the bottom right, there are additional icons and a circular meter, likely indicating status effects or special abilities. The setting suggests exploration or a puzzle-solving segment, with the highlighted object possibly being a collectible or a quest item."
