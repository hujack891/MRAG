    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character, dressed in fur and wielding a flaming weapon, is engaged in combat with an enemy. The enemy appears to be a humanoid figure surrounded by a blue aura, and its health bar is partially depleted, indicating ongoing combat. The environment is a dark cave with rocky terrain and a large statue carved into the wall. Several UI components are visible: a health bar at the bottom left, a set of icons representing abilities or items, and a counter labeled \"Will x106\" on the right side of the screen. These elements suggest resource management and ability usage are key aspects of gameplay."
