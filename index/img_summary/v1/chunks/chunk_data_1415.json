    "img_summary": "The image displays a weapon crafting interface from a video game, focusing on the \"Kang-Jin Staff,\" classified as an Epic weapon. The staff has an attack value of 70 and a critical hit chance of 6%. It features a unique effect called \"Punishing Downpour,\" which converts thunder damage to target-specific damage rather than area damage. The crafting menu shows the materials required to craft the staff, including Starlit Cloud-Bidden Antler, Refined Iron Sand, and Yaoguai Core. The player currently lacks sufficient materials, specifically needing more \"Will\" points, as indicated by the red text. The UI on the right side shows various character stats such as health, attack, defense, and elemental resistances, with some stats highlighted in green or red to indicate changes. A poetic text is displayed at the bottom, possibly providing lore or thematic context."
