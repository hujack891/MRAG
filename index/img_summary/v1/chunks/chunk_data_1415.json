    "img_summary": "The image displays a crafting menu from a video game, focusing on the \"Kang-Jin Staff,\" an epic weapon. The staff has an attack power of 70 and a critical hit chance of 6%. Its unique effect, \"Punishing Downpour,\" deals thunder damage to enemies instead of area damage. The crafting requirements include Starlit Cloud-Bidden Antler, Refined Iron Sand, Yaoguai Core, and Will, but the player currently has insufficient materials, specifically lacking Will. The player's current stats are shown on the right, including health, attack, and various other attributes. A quote at the bottom reflects on desires and valor in life and death."
