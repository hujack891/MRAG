    "img_summary": "The image showcases the Golden Loong Staff, a mythical weapon in the game *Black Myth: Wukong*. It highlights the weapon's stats, unique effect, and crafting requirements. The staff moderately boosts damage for Pillar Stance moves and enables summoning a \"loong\" to execute thunder attacks during heavy strikes. The crafting menu indicates insufficient materials for upgrading the weapon, while the detailed design of the staff emphasizes its golden, dragon-like aesthetic. The image serves to illustrate the weapon's functionality and visual appeal within the game's crafting system."
