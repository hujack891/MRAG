    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the video game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically during the boss fight against the Violet Spider in Chapter 4. The player character is engaged in combat with the Violet Spider, a formidable boss that takes the form of a giant spider. The image captures the moment when the Violet Spider has burrowed its head into the ground, leaving its abdomen exposed, which is a precursor to a deadly poison explosion attack. This visual serves as a guide to players, illustrating a critical phase in the battle where caution is advised."
