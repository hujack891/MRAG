This scene is part of the Precept Corridor section in the Bitter Lake Walkthrough of the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" The corridor is a transitional area where players navigate through challenging terrain, including sliding down slopes and encountering obstacles, ultimately leading to a cave-like room with a significant Buddha statue. The image captures the atmospheric and mystical environment players experience while traversing this part of the game."
