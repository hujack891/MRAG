    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy environment with traditional Asian architecture. The main character, dressed in fur clothing and wielding a spear, is crouched and appears to be sneaking or preparing for combat. An enemy is visible on a wooden structure, marked by a red indicator above its head, suggesting it is aware of the player's presence. The user interface includes several elements: a health bar at the bottom left, a \"Will\" counter showing 39 units, and various icons indicating abilities or items. The environment suggests strategic gameplay involving stealth and combat."
