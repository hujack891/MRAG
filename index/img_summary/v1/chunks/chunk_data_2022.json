    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where two characters are engaged in combat on a snowy terrain. The character on the left is mid-air, appearing to attack the character on the right, who is crouching with a weapon in hand. There are visual effects indicating impact or an explosion around the airborne character. The interface displays various icons and meters, including health bars for both characters, and action buttons labeled with \"RT\" and \"LT\" at the bottom of the screen. The environment is a rocky, snow-covered area, suggesting a cold, mountainous setting."
