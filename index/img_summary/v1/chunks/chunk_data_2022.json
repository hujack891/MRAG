    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene from a video game set in a snowy environment. Two characters are engaged in battle; one is airborne, seemingly attacking, while the other is crouched defensively on the ground. The airborne character has a visible health bar above them, indicating they are an enemy. The user interface (UI) displays various icons on the left and right sides of the screen, likely representing abilities or items available to the player. At the bottom left, there is a health bar and possibly a stamina or mana bar, showing the player's current status. The environment is detailed with snow-covered ground and rocky terrain, suggesting a cold, mountainous setting."
