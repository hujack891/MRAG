Whenever you spot him rise up in the air on his two appendages and create a gust around him, he's actually coating the area in frost, which will quickly raise your frost meter while in the area.\n\nConsidering how snowy the area already is, this can be quite dangerous as it's hard to tell where the affected area is. Look carefully for a low mist, or try to reposition yourself in a non snow-covered area to see when its been painted over in white.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically during the miniboss fight against the \"Monk from the Sea\" in the New Thunderclap Temple region. The scene shows a character, likely the player, engaged in combat with the Monk from the Sea, who is airborne and appears to be preparing an attack. The snowy, mountainous environment emphasizes the frost-infused abilities of the miniboss, which are a key challenge in this encounter. The image is part of a walkthrough guide, illustrating the intense and visually striking nature of this particular boss fight."
