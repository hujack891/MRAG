    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character is engaged in combat with a fiery attack. The character is surrounded by flames, suggesting the use of a fire-based ability. On the left side of the image, there are instructions for different attacks: \"Light Attack 'Chop Wood'\" using the X button, \"Heavy Attack 'Blow Fire'\" using the Y button, and \"Spell 'Fiery Burst'\" using the RT + B buttons. These attacks appear to involve building up focus, burning enemies, and dealing area damage. The bottom of the image shows a health or focus bar labeled \"Non-Void,\" indicating the status of the character or enemy. The environment is a stone floor with scattered debris, and a large door is visible in the background."
