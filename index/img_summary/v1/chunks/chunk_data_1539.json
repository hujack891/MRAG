The character is near an altar, and a red arrow points towards a distant location, likely indicating the direction to find the first Purple Talisman in the Middle Hollow. This is part of a guide to help players locate all Purple Talismans in the chapter, which are essential for triggering cutscenes and encountering a hidden boss. The image serves as a visual aid to guide players to the specific location of the first talisman."
