In the foreground, a character resembling the Destined One from *Black Myth: Wukong* is seen, suggesting a pivotal moment or setting in Chapter 3 - \"White Snow, Ice Cold.\" The serene yet foreboding environment aligns with the chapter's theme, transitioning from the arid deserts of Chapter 2 to a harsh, frozen realm. This visual likely serves to immerse players in the story's progression and highlights the stark contrast between chapters."
