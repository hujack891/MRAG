    "img_summary": "The image displays a video game interface focused on the \"Equipment\" section, specifically highlighting a spirit called \"Mountain Patroller.\" This spirit is classified as rare and requires a moderate Qi cost for use. The ability \"Swift Leap\" allows the player to take the form of Mountain Patroller, performing a leap and unleashing a flurry of slashes to deter foes. The equipped effect slightly increases the critical hit chance of jump heavy attacks. The interface includes options to equip the spirit and watch a demo, with various stats listed on the right side, such as health, stamina, and attack power."
