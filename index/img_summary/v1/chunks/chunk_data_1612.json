    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game showing the \"Equipment\" menu, specifically focusing on the \"Spirits\" section. The player is selecting the \"Mountain Patroller,\" a rare spirit with a moderate Qi cost. The spirit's ability, \"Swift Leap,\" allows the player to take its form and perform a series of slashes to deter foes. The equipped effect slightly increases the critical hit chance of jump heavy attacks. The UI displays various spirits available for selection, each with unique icons. On the right side, there are player stats such as health (690), stamina (380), and attack power (310), among others. The player can equip the spirit by pressing \"E\" and use it in combat with \"F.\" A small demo image shows the spirit in action within a forest environment."
