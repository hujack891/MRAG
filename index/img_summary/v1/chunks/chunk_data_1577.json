    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game set in a snowy, mountainous environment with large statues of meditating figures carved into the rock face. The player character, dressed in elaborate armor and wielding a staff, stands in front of a large statue. A prompt on the screen indicates the player can press \"RT\" to \"Meditate.\" The user interface (UI) displays various icons on the left side, likely representing abilities or items, and a health bar at the bottom left. The bottom right corner shows a mini-map and additional icons, possibly for navigation or other gameplay functions. The scene suggests a moment of interaction or a checkpoint where the player can meditate, possibly to regain health or save progress."
