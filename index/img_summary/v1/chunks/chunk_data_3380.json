    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a tense moment from the boss fight against the Violet Spider in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The player character is engaged in combat with the spider, a large and grotesque creature surrounded by webbing in a dimly lit, cavernous environment. The spider appears mid-attack, emphasizing its threatening presence. The game's interface is visible, showing health bars, abilities, and the boss's name, \"Violet Spider,\" at the bottom of the screen.\n\n2. **Purpose and Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates the climactic encounter with the Yaoguai Queen, a major boss in the \"Webbed Hollow - Lower Hollow Walkthrough.\" It visually supports the preceding text, which describes the spider's attack patterns, such as webbing, poison projectiles, and blade-like appendages. This serves to highlight the challenge and strategy required to defeat the Violet Spider in this section of the game."
