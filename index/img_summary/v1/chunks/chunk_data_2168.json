    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, rocky cave environment with a path leading into a dimly lit area. A red arrow is prominently pointing towards the entrance of the cave, suggesting it as a direction or point of interest for the player. The surrounding area is shadowy with overgrown vegetation, indicating a natural setting. The lack of visible characters or UI elements suggests this is a navigational cue within the game, directing players to explore or proceed through the cave entrance."
