    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where a character is engaged in combat with a large, stone-like creature named \"Stone Vanguard.\" The creature appears to be performing a powerful attack, causing debris and dust to scatter around. On the left side of the screen, instructions for two types of attacks are displayed: a \"Light Attack\" called \"Earth Shatter,\" which involves striking the enemy three times with a heavy head, and a \"Heavy Attack\" called \"Mountain Splitter,\" which involves dashing forward with full force and can be fully charged to dash further. The bottom of the screen shows a health bar for the Stone Vanguard, indicating its remaining health."
