The character is holding a glowing staff, and the game interface indicates the player's current status and abilities.\n\n2. The image's purpose is to illustrate a moment in the game where the player discovers a secret passage in \"The Loong’s Secret Tomb\" by luring the First Prince of Flowing Sands into breaking the wall. This visual supports the preceding text's description of a hidden mechanic in the boss fight, emphasizing the importance of the player's positioning and actions to reveal secrets.\n\n3. The metadata, such as the document and section titles, helps to situate the image within the context of the guide for finding and defeating the First Prince of Flowing Sands in \"Black Myth Wukong,\" specifically within \"The Loong’s Secret Tomb.\""
