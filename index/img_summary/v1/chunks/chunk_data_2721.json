It shows the protagonist standing in a rocky, temple-like environment, surrounded by stone lion statues and a lit brazier, with a key object or shrine visible in the background. This setting is likely where the player uses the \"Sterness of Stone\" Key Item to interact with a Tally, enabling progression through the chapter. The image visually supports the preceding text's explanation of the item's role in unlocking paths and gates."
