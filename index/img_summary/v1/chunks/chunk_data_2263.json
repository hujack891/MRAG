    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy forest environment from a video game, showing a character dressed in a cloak and carrying a staff, moving through the snow. The user interface (UI) elements include a health bar at the bottom left, which appears to be full, and several ability icons arranged in a circular pattern, indicating available skills or items. On the bottom right, there are additional ability icons with button prompts (RT, LT) suggesting controller inputs. A red arrow in the scene points towards a distant figure, possibly an enemy or an objective, partially obscured by trees.
