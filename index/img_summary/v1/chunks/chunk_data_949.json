It will hop inside Bajie's mouth, and you'll need to do the same to be able to fight the insect. You'll soon be transformed and literally entering the belly of the beast.\n\nThe mantis will now become quite erratic with its movements, flipping all around the stomach.

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic moment from the boss fight against the Emerald-Armed Mantis in *Black Myth: Wukong*. Set inside Zhu Bajie's stomach, the scene showcases the player character wielding a flaming weapon, facing off against the glowing, insect-like mantis amidst a grotesque, organic environment. The smoky atmosphere and dynamic pose emphasize the intensity of the battle. This visual aligns with the guide's description of the mantis's erratic movements and the need for strategic tools like the Plantain Fan to immobilize it."
