    "img_summary": "The image displays the equipment menu from a video game, focusing on the \"Civet Sergeant\" spirit. This spirit is categorized as \"Rare\" with a moderate Qi cost.

The ability can be activated in combat by pressing 'F'. The equipped effect slightly increases the player's attack. The menu shows a grid of various spirits available for selection, with the Civet Sergeant highlighted. On the right, player stats are displayed, including health, stamina, and other attributes. A small demo video of the ability is visible, with an option to close it. The interface includes navigation options for different sections like Self-Advance, Relics, Inventory, and more."
