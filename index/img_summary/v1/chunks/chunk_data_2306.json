Captain Wise-Voice is seen emitting thin beams of light from its head, which are part of its unorthodox attack pattern. The beams are shown erupting in various directions, creating a visually intense scene that aligns with the preceding text's advice to strafe and dodge when the beams converge. The image serves to illustrate the challenging nature of this boss fight, emphasizing the need for strategic movement and quick reflexes."
