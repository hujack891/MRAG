    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character, seen from behind, is holding a large staff or pole weapon and facing two enemy creatures. These creatures resemble humanoid animals, possibly wolves or other similar beasts, and are positioned in a forested environment with rocky and grassy terrain. The setting is dimly lit, suggesting a natural, possibly mystical forest area. There are no visible UI components or text hints in the image, focusing solely on the confrontation between the player character and the enemies. This scene likely represents a combat encounter within the game."
