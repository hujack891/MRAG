In the foreground, a figure crouches near some objects, possibly preparing for an encounter. This scene is part of the \"Where to Find the Tiger's Acolyte\" section in the document titled \"Tiger's Acolyte.\" The image serves to illustrate the location within the Yellow Wind Formation where players can find the optional miniboss, Tiger's Acolyte, in Chapter 2 of the game Black Myth Wukong."
