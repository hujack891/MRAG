The caption \"That includes yours too.\" suggests an interaction or dialogue, possibly related to the mysterious purple seal and the warning from the cell's occupant mentioned in the preceding text. This image serves to illustrate the challenging and ominous atmosphere of the Pagoda Realm, emphasizing the narrative of danger and the need for caution."
