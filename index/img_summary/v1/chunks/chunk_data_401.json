    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character, holding a staff, is standing in front of a small stone altar or pedestal in a rocky, cave-like environment. The character appears to be interacting with the altar, as indicated by the on-screen prompt \"RT Open,\" suggesting that the player can press the RT button to open or interact with the object. The altar is illuminated, possibly indicating its importance or the presence of an item. The game's user interface displays various icons and a health bar at the bottom of the screen. The setting is dark and atmospheric, with a large, fallen stone structure visible in the background."
