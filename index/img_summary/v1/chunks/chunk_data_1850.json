    "img_summary": "The image depicts the Macaque Chief, a recurring miniboss in *Black Myth: Wukong*, during the first encounter in the Snowhill Path. The snowy environment highlights the Frost-inflicting attacks that reduce mobility, as described in the guide. The Macaque Chief is shown mid-action, wielding his blade in a spinning attack, emphasizing his agility and combat style. This visual complements the preceding text, which advises players to prepare for the fight by using Body-Warming Pills to counter Frost effects. The image serves to illustrate the challenging nature of this boss fight and its setting."
