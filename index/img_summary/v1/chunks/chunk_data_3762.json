Located at the center of the large black tornado in the Yellow Wind Formation in the center of the region, you'll need two Key Items to open a path to him.\n* **Rewards:** Samahdi Wind Agate, Cold Iron Leaves x2, Refined Iron Sand x1, Silk x5, Yaoguai Core x2, Mind Core x1, 2583 Experience, 1944 Will\n## Yellow Wind Sage Boss Fight and Guide\nThe final boss of Chapter 2 is a hulking rat who holds an incredible trident spear in one hand, while the other carries… a giant head? If you think this may limit his moves, you’re unfortunately in for a rude awakening. The Yellow Wind Sage has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, and is not only a deadly attacker, but a master of the Samadhi Winds — but more on that later.\nMake sure you're suitably prepared for the fight in the best ways possible: Craft a bunch of medicine to increase your damage absorption and max health, and allocate any Mind Cores you’ve found toward Celestial Medicine buffs. You should also have a full set of either the Galeguard or Insect armor fully crafted, as well as the Cloud-Patterened Stone Staff from defeating the optional Sihandang boss. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you’ve beaten the Chapter 2 Secret Boss and equipped the new Vessel, the Wind Tamer.\n\nUsing his giant weapon, the Yellow Wind Sage is able to create huge waves of force by slashing his trident spear, sending out wide projectile slices your way. He’ll often perform two in a row from an upward slash followed by a horizontal slash, and then a delay before jumping upward to create a third vertical slash and send the wave of force your way.",
