This visual accompanies the description of the bad ending in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" where The Destined One confronts Wukong after the final boss fight. The image likely represents the moment when The Destined One, despite gaining great powers, faces Wukong, leading to a somber conclusion as a crown falls into the water, symbolizing a failed or incomplete victory."
