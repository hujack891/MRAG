    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy forest environment. A bald character wearing a torn jacket is shown in a dynamic pose, seemingly in the middle of an action or combat sequence. The character is holding a severed leg, which appears to be part of another character or creature. The interface displays various icons and gauges, including health and stamina bars, as well as action buttons labeled \"RT\" and \"LT.\" The name \"Non-Able\" is visible above a gauge, suggesting it might be related to the character or a status effect."
