    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a rugged, barren environment with rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. In the foreground, a character is engaged in combat, possibly performing an attack. The left side of the screen displays a list of combat moves and their descriptions: \"Light Attack 'Chop Wood'\" (X button), \"Heavy Attack 'Blow Fire'\" (Y button), and \"Spell 'Fiery Burst'\" (RT + B buttons). These moves involve using an iron blade, unleashing a fiery attack, and a self-detonating spell that deals area damage. At the bottom, a UI element shows a gauge, possibly indicating health or energy, and an icon that might represent the character or a status effect. The environment suggests a challenging area with potential for combat encounters."
