That said, he does hit harder and can empower certain moves, so don’t assume this will be a cakewalk. You’ll want to have upgraded your staff after defeating the Whiteclad Noble to dish out more damage, and using the Wandering Wight’s Spirit on this guy can help tremendously.\n\nOnce Elder Jinchi is defeated, you’ll automatically be returned back to the third bell in the Marsh of the White Mist.
