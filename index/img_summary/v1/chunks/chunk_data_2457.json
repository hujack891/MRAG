    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character, wearing a cloak made of straw or grass, is wielding a staff with a glowing, fiery end. The character is positioned in a rocky, cave-like environment. In the distance, two enemies are visible, one of which has a health bar above its head, indicating it is an opponent. The user interface (UI) displays various elements: in the bottom left corner, there are icons for items or abilities, with one showing a count of 17. A health bar is visible above these icons. The bottom right corner shows additional skill icons, each with button prompts (e.g., R2, L1+R2), suggesting different abilities or actions the player can perform. The image is likely from a combat scenario, highlighting the player's readiness to engage with the enemies."
