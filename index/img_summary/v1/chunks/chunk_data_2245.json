    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy forest environment. A character, equipped with a large staff, is navigating through the snow-covered terrain. The user interface displays several key elements: a health bar at the top right corner, indicating the character's current health status; a \"Will\" counter showing 67 units, possibly related to a resource or ability; and various icons at the bottom left, which likely represent abilities or items the character can use. Additionally, there are icons at the bottom center labeled with button prompts (RT, LT), suggesting actions or abilities that can be activated. The environment is detailed with snow-covered trees and rocks, contributing to the immersive setting of the game."
