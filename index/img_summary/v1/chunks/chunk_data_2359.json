    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where a character is navigating a precarious, rope-like bridge in a dark, cavernous environment. The character is holding a glowing, fiery staff, illuminating their path. The bridge is made of twisted, organic-looking ropes. Game interface elements are visible, including icons and a health or stamina bar at the bottom of the screen, indicating the player's current status and abilities. The setting is atmospheric, with a dimly lit cave and a distant light source in the background."
