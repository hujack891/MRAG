Taking double damage from any of his attacks is highly inadvisable, so make sure your Shock-Quelling Powder is on your quickbar for this fight.\nYellowbrow chiefly attacks with a large spiked mace while he holds his magic seedbag in the other hand. Be incredibly wary of his weapon, as it has the ability to change its shape, and he can extend the handle at will both in size, length, and flexibility.\n\nWhen he starts to chastise you and proclaim you \"insolent\", watch for him to wave his mace around to create small little motes of electricity around his head. Hang back when he does this, and wait for a moment for the orbs to come racing in your direction. Use your staff spin to quickly clear them out, while being ready to dodge if Yellowbrow employs another attack.",

Yellowbrow, a large and formidable character, is seen mid-attack, generating powerful lightning effects aimed at the player character, who is shown in a defensive stance. The image highlights the intense and visually striking nature of the boss battle, emphasizing Yellowbrow's use of lightning attacks and the player's need to dodge and counter these moves. This visual serves to illustrate the challenging encounter described in the walkthrough, where players must be cautious of Yellowbrow's varied and dangerous abilities."
