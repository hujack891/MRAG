    "img_summary": "The image depicts a gameplay moment from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing the protagonist engaged in combat with a boss-like enemy named \"Red Loong.\" The scene highlights the use of heavy attacks, as suggested by the context of the section \"11. Heavy Attacks Work Differently.\" The dark, atmospheric environment and visible UI elements, including health bars and ability icons, emphasize the strategic nature of the encounter. This visual likely supports the preceding text, which explains the unique mechanics of heavy attacks, such as their effectiveness for single-target damage and the ability to charge them while moving."
