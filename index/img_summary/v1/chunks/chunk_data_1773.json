    "img_summary": "The image shows a character in a dark, dilapidated environment, possibly a courtyard with old structures. The character is holding a weapon and is partially obscured by shadows. The UI elements include various icons on the left and right sides, likely representing abilities or items, and a health bar at the bottom left. There is a prompt in the center of the screen indicating the option to \"Use\" something. Text at the bottom reads \"I'm here, little monkey,\" suggesting a narrative or quest element. The environment appears to be ancient and abandoned, contributing to a mysterious and eerie atmosphere."
