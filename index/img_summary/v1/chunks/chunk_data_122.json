Though the game helps by limiting the skills trees you can first interact with, there is still a wide variety of skills to choose from. With so many choices, choosing which skills to unlock can be daunting, but our guide is designed to help you decide which skills to unlock.\n**Jump to:**\n* How to Unlock Skills in Black Myth: Wukong\n* How to Understand the Early Game Skills Trees\n* How to Understand the Mid-to-Late Game Skills Trees\n* Best Foundation Skills to Unlock\n* Best Staff Stances Skills to Unlock\n* Best Mysticism Skills to Unlock\n* Best Alteration Skills to Unlock\n* Best Strand Skills to Unlock\n* Best Transformations Skills to Unlock\n## How to Understand the Mid-to-Late Game Skills Trees\nWhen you hit level 20 and beyond, you'll start to unlock even more of the Skills Trees. By the end of Chapter 2/start of Chapter 3, you can have all of the Skills tabs unlocked (as long as you've explored thoroughly and taken down optional bosses). This will grant you the Alteration, Strand, and Transformations skills.\nAlteration applies to spells like Cloud Step and Rock Solid and will improve the health of your decoy, movement speed, and unlock the chance to deflect attacks with a parry.\nThe Transformations menu applies to any Transformation spells you collect and you'll find skills to improve might recovery, maximum health when transformed, increased defense, and more.\n### Best Foundation Skills to Unlock\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Simian Agility**|  Moderately reduces stamina cost of Dodging\n**Robust Constitution**|  Each talent level moderately increases Maximum Health\n**Rampant Vigor**|  Increase maximum stamina\n**Effortless Finisher**|  More Focus when the Second move on Light Attack combo hits an enemy\n**Punishing Downpour**|  Light Attack Finisher deals extra Damage after six successful hits\n**Composure**|  Dodging doesn't interrupt Light Attack Combo\nFoundation Skills are full of useful abilities and we'd recommend focusing your Sparks in this category, especially at the start of the game.\nRobust Constitution and Rampant Vigor will give you boosts to your health and stamina respectively, helping you in those early fights. Similan Agility works well with Rampant Vigor, reducing the stamina cost of dodging, while you're already benefiting from an increase to max stamina. Being able to dodge consistently and worry less about stamina will get you out of some sticky situations.\n\nFinally, in the Strand menu, you'll find the spell A Pluck of Many, where you can send out multiple Duplicates to help you. The skills you can unlock here will increase the health of your Duplicates, along with their attack power, and more.",
