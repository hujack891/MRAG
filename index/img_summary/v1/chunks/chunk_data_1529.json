    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a player character is engaged in combat with a large enemy named \"Mad Tiger.\" The environment is a rocky, dimly-lit area with debris and dust in the air, suggesting an intense battle. On the left side of the screen, there are instructions for two types of attacks: a \"Light Attack\" called \"Earth Shatter,\" which involves striking the enemy three times, and a \"Heavy Attack\" named \"Mountain Splitter,\" which allows the player to dash forward with full force. A health bar labeled \"Mad Tiger\" is visible at the bottom, indicating the enemy's remaining health. Additionally, there are UI elements on the right, including icons that may represent abilities or items, and a circular icon at the bottom right that could be related to the player's status or abilities."
