    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game set in a dimly lit cave environment. The central character, equipped with a staff, appears to be a humanoid figure with distinctive, possibly mythical features, such as horns. In the background, there are two enemies: one with a visible health bar and an eye icon above it, suggesting it is aware of the player's presence, and a larger, shadowy figure in the distance. The user interface at the bottom of the screen includes health and stamina bars, along with various ability or item icons, indicating the player's available actions or resources. The scene suggests a combat or stealth scenario where the player must navigate and possibly engage with the enemies."
