The character is shown airborne in a rocky, forested environment, emphasizing its ability to attack from the air using projectiles. This visual complements the preceding text, which advises players to use the Plantain Fan to bring the Supreme Inspector down for easier attacks. The image serves to illustrate the boss's appearance and its aerial combat behavior within the walkthrough narrative."
