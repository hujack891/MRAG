    "img_summary": "The image displays the equipment menu from a video game, featuring a selection of spirits that can be equipped by the player. The highlighted spirit is labeled \"Epic\" and named \"Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top,\" with a high Qi cost. Its ability, \"Two in One,\" transforms the player into an iron ball that strikes foes three times. The equipped effect significantly increases defense but moderately reduces attack. The menu provides options to equip the spirit, watch a demo, and use it in combat by pressing 'F'. The UI shows various player stats, including health, attack, defense, and other attributes, with some values indicating increases or decreases. The top right corner displays the player's currency and another resource count."
