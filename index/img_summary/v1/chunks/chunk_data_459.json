A character, equipped with a staff, is approaching a small creature highlighted by a red dashed circle, indicating it may be an objective or enemy. The user interface (UI) includes several elements: a health bar at the bottom left, a selection of icons for abilities or items on the left side, and additional icons on the right side, possibly for actions or powers. The bottom right corner shows a mini-map and indicators for controls using RT and LT buttons, suggesting the game is played on a console.
