    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character in a video game, equipped with a spear-like weapon, sliding down a steep, moss-covered cliff. The environment is a lush, rocky landscape with a mix of greenery and barren areas. In the background, a river or stream is visible, surrounded by dense forest. A red arrow points towards a specific area at the bottom of the cliff, suggesting a target location or objective for the player. This visual cue indicates a direction or path that the player should follow, likely as part of the gameplay progression."
