    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a player character is engaged in combat with a large enemy. The enemy appears to be a humanoid creature engulfed in flames, suggesting it might have fire-based abilities or vulnerabilities. The environment is a barren, rocky landscape with sparse vegetation. The user interface includes several elements: a health bar at the bottom left showing the player's current health status, which is partially depleted; a series of icons indicating available abilities or items; and a circular gauge at the bottom right, possibly related to stamina or special abilities. Additionally, there are button prompts labeled \"RT\" and \"LT,\" likely indicating actions the player can perform using a controller. Overall, the image highlights a tense combat scenario requiring strategic use of the player's abilities and resources."
