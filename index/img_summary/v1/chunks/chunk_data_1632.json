    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy environment. The player character, holding a spear, stands on a staircase leading down to a path where an enemy is approaching. The enemy, a large humanoid figure, has a red health bar above its head, indicating it is hostile. The user interface includes various icons on the bottom left and right corners, likely representing abilities or items that can be used, with some labeled with button prompts like \"RT.\" The environment features snow-covered trees and a traditional stone lantern, suggesting a setting inspired by East Asian architecture. The player's health and stamina bars are displayed at the bottom center of the screen."
