    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character is running through a barren, rocky desert environment. The character is holding a long staff and is viewed from behind, suggesting a third-person perspective. The user interface (UI) elements include a health bar at the bottom left, which appears to be partially depleted, and several icons on both sides of the screen. The left side icons might represent abilities or items, while the right side icons could indicate skills or actions, with button prompts labeled \"RT\" (likely for a controller). The environment is desolate, with rocky terrain and sparse, leafless trees, creating a sense of isolation or a challenging journey ahead."
