    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character is exploring a rocky, cavernous environment. The character is holding a glowing staff, suggesting they may have magical abilities or are using it as a light source. In the foreground, there is a cluster of glowing objects on the ground, possibly collectibles or items to interact with. The interface shows various icons, likely representing abilities or items the character can use, and a status bar indicating the character's current health or energy level. The top right corner displays a resource labeled \"Will\" with a count of 66, possibly a currency or energy type used in the game. The environment is dimly lit, with shadows and a mysterious atmosphere."
