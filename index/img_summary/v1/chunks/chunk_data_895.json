He’s fairly formidable in his own right, and you’ll need to learn his attacks to win the duel. The Yellow-Robed Squire is a big fan of hurling dust clouds in your direction to mask his movements, and you’ll need to be even more reactive than usual to make sure you don’t get blindsided.\n\nHe’ll often start the fight by hurling dust in front of him, and then performing a fast charge attack to gore you with his tusks, but you can shut him down with a well timed Rock Solid deflection.\n\nOne of his main combos will begin with another “pocket sand” attack, followed by two quick swipes from his extended claws, and then a delayed jump attack to finish the combo, which can send up tremors from where he impacts.",
