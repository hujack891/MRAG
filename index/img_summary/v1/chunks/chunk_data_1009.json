It shows a player character facing off against the Flint Vanguard, a large, rocky creature with glowing fiery cracks, accompanied by smaller fiery enemies. This visual represents the challenging encounter described in the preceding text, where players must first deal with the accompanying Searing and Scorching-Fire enemies before focusing on the Flint Vanguard."
