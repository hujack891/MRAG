This visual likely corresponds to the instructions in the \"Returning to Fox Form\" sub-section of the \"Snow Fox Questline\" document, guiding players to navigate the environment by sticking to the right side, ascending stairs, and crossing the bridge to progress in the quest. The setting emphasizes exploration and the transition to fox form in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\""
