    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character, wielding a staff, is engaged in combat with a large, dust-covered enemy named \"First Prince of Flowing Sands,\" as indicated by the health bar at the bottom of the screen. The environment is a rocky, desert-like area with swirling sand and debris, suggesting a dynamic battle setting. The user interface includes various icons on the left and right sides, likely representing abilities or items, with some buttons labeled for quick access (e.g., RT, LT). The player's health or resource bar is visible at the bottom left, showing a mostly full status. The scene suggests an intense boss fight scenario."
