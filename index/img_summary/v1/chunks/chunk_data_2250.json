    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy environment featuring two characters engaged in combat. One character is attacking with a spear, while the other is on the ground, seemingly defending or evading. In the background, there are large stone carvings of figures on a wall, adding to the atmospheric setting. The user interface (UI) displays various elements: on the bottom left, there are icons for abilities or items, with labels like \"LB\" and \"LT\"; a health bar is visible, showing a white, red, and blue segmented bar indicating the player's health and possibly other stats. On the bottom right, additional icons suggest more abilities or actions, labeled with \"RT\" and other symbols. The UI components provide information on available actions and the player's status during gameplay."
