    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a desolate and rugged area within Windrest Hamlet, part of the Yellow Sand Formation in *Black Myth: Wukong*. It features a traditional stone archway in the background surrounded by barren terrain, twisted trees, and rocky formations. In the foreground, a humanoid figure crouches near logs and debris, suggesting stealth or preparation for combat. The scene conveys an atmosphere of tension and danger, aligning with the preceding text's guidance on strategic combat against enemies in this area.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThe image visually represents the challenging environment of Windrest Hamlet, where players must navigate hostile terrain and engage enemies strategically. It complements the walkthrough's advice on isolating melee attackers and exploring nearby structures for items like the green Wisp. The archway may signify a transition point or a significant location within the area."
