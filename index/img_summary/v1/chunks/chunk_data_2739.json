Additionally, each sip grants a considerable amount of Qi - which is a nice bonus on top of the basic healing.\nAs with all Drinks, the potency of it can be increased by finding the Awoken Wine Worm locations around the game's areas. Our page has each location for you.\nYou can then use these Crafting Materials to upgrade the Drink at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove within Black Wind Mountain. Each upgrade will provide a sizeable buff to your healing potential. As you level the Drink up, more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed to further upgrade it.\nThis carries over to New Game Plus too, as you can upgrade your Drinks even more, but once again more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed, so you will have to recollect them all in your New Game Plus run.\n## Black Myth: Wukong Sunset of the Nine Skies Location\nThe Sunset of the Nine Skies drink can be found in the Temple of the Yellow Flowers, Court of Illumination area in The Webbed Hollow.
