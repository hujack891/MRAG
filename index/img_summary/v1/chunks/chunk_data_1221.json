    "img_summary": "The image depicts a gameplay scene from a video game where the player character is engaged in combat with an enemy named \"Green-Capped Martialist.\" The environment appears to be a rocky, dimly-lit area, possibly a cave or dungeon. The enemy is a dark, humanoid figure surrounded by a fiery aura, suggesting it is performing an attack or special move. The player character is seen crouching or preparing to dodge. The user interface includes health and stamina bars at the bottom, with the health bar showing partial depletion. There are also various icons indicating abilities or items available for use, with corresponding button prompts (RT, RB) for activation. A text hint at the bottom reads, \"Kindness is useless if you don't have wisdom,\" possibly offering thematic advice or narrative context."
