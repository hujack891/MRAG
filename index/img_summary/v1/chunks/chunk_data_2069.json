Finding opportunities to get your own attacks in can be difficult, but you'll need to resist the urge to jump in too early or you'll be hit and staggered multiple times.\nGiven his long sweeping swings, having backup from A Pluck of Many or Spirits that summon other allies won't work as well as they'll tend to get hit even if he's focusing all his attention on you.\n\nWhen he decides to get nasty with his combos, you'll either want to learn the moves and deflect one to knock him off balance, or Immobilize to shut him down. One of his most lengthy combos will come when he sweeps his weapon upward and then back down for two rotations, and then quickly swings it back and forth three more times, before leaping up to perform one last spin attack as he lands. Without a lot of stamina in reserve, it will be tough one to evade completely.",
