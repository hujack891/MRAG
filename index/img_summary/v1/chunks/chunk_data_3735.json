    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a rocky outdoor setting with two characters interacting near a carved stone statue embedded in the cliffside. One character appears to be the Wise Master, referenced in the preceding text, who previously imbued the protagonist's gourd with spirit-absorbing powers. The dialogue at the bottom mentions a treasure tied to the Old Loong King, hinting at lore or a quest item related to the narrative.\n\n2. **Purpose and Narrative Role**:  \nThis scene likely serves as a key moment in the \"Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Gore-Eye Daoist\" section of the *Yellow Sand Formation Walkthrough*. It provides additional context or guidance for the protagonist, possibly introducing a significant item or piece of lore (the scale shed by the Old Loong King) that may aid in the upcoming mini-boss fight or broader exploration of the Windseal Gate area."
