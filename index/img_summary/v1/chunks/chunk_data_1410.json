The character, Wukong, is standing inside a hut near a golden turtle-shaped container on a table, which likely holds the Goji Shoots. This Soak provides a gameplay buff that extends the duration of the Ring of Fire effect when using the Gourd. The image serves as a visual guide to help players identify the exact spot to find the Goji Shoots in the game."
