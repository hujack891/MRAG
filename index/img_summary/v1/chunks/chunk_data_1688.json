    "img_summary": "The image depicts a climactic moment from the boss fight against the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The scene shows the boss, now transformed into a centipede-like demon, bathed in a golden dome of energy, which marks the start of his final phase. This phase is characterized by increased damage output, stamina reduction for the player, and the boss abandoning his sword in favor of electric fist and tail attacks. The golden hue and shattered debris emphasize the intensity and danger of this stage in the battle. The image serves to visually represent the described transition to the boss's most challenging form."
