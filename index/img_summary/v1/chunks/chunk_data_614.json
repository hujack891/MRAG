    "img_summary": "The image shows a character standing in a dimly lit, rocky environment, possibly a cave or cavern. The character is equipped with a staff and wears a hat and armor, suggesting they are prepared for combat or exploration. In front of the character, a glowing purple flame or aura is visible, indicating an interactable object or item. A UI prompt appears next to the flame, displaying the text \"E Take,\" which suggests the player can press the 'E' key to collect or interact with the object. The environment is dark and rugged, with shadows and textures that imply a mysterious or challenging setting."
