Taking double damage from any of his attacks is highly inadvisable, so make sure your Shock-Quelling Powder is on your quickbar for this fight.\nYellowbrow chiefly attacks with a large spiked mace while he holds his magic seedbag in the other hand. Be incredibly wary of his weapon, as it has the ability to change its shape, and he can extend the handle at will both in size, length, and flexibility.\n\nAfter fighting for a bit, Yellowbrow will often vanish into thin air, but you can get a heads up on where he's going by looking for his shadow on the ground and which direction it darts off to.",
