Unlike some of the other Transformations, Azure Dust doesn't have much flexibility in how you use it. But, it has some powerful attacks even the Transformation is hard to control.\nThe Transformation allows you to transform into a rock guai, immune to all Four Banes. Azure Dust also builds up Might when hit. Azure Dust's moveset is as follows:\n* **Light Attack: Earth Shatter - Strike the enemy three times with your heavy head**. This is a powerful slam on the ground with your head that can be repeated.\n\n* **Heavy Attack: Mountain Splitter - Dash forward with full force. Fully charge to dash further**. This is a slow, but heavy charged dash which can pin enemies and also get you out of danger if needed. It lacks a lot of control, however.",

    "img_summary": "The image from the document \"Azure Dust\" depicts a scene from the game Black Myth: Wukong, showcasing the Azure Dust transformation spell. In this transformation, the player character appears as a rock guai, emphasizing its immunity to all Four Banes and ability to build up Might when hit. The image highlights the moveset associated with Azure Dust, featuring the \"Earth Shatter\" light attack and \"Mountain Splitter\" heavy attack, which are powerful but challenging to control. The visual setting is a rugged, rocky landscape, reinforcing the theme of strength and resilience inherent in the transformation."
