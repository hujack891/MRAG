    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where a bald, bearded character is kneeling over a shimmering, ghostly figure on the ground. The environment appears to be a dimly lit, stone-walled area. The user interface (UI) includes a health bar labeled \"Non-Void,\" which is nearly depleted, suggesting a critical state for the character. On the bottom left, there are hexagonal icons, possibly representing abilities or items, and a flask icon with a partially filled bar, likely indicating a consumable resource. On the bottom right, additional circular icons may represent skills or actions available to the player. The overall scene suggests a tense moment, possibly involving combat or a significant event in the game."
