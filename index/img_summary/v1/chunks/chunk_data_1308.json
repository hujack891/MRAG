This character is likely the \"Yellow-Robed Square\" or \"Drunken Boar\" mentioned in the preceding text, who plays a key role in accessing the secret area in the Kingdom of Sahali in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong. The boar appears to be in a confrontational stance, which aligns with the narrative of challenging the player to a duel before allowing access to the Realm of Gold."
