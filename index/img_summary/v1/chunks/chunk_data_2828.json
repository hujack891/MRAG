Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).\nAs mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses.\n\nHis other burrowing attack is equally damaging, though it comes less often. He'll start by tossing his sword at you, which will continue to spin wildly in a small circle near your position. As soon as you dodge it, immediately sprint away, as his tail will burst forth around the sword, spraying poison in nearly every direction.",
