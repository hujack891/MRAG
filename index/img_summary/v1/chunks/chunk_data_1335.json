The cave walls are rugged and rocky, and there is a large, faded mural or painting on the wall behind the character. Two fire pits on either side of the mural provide illumination, casting a warm glow on the surroundings. The ground is strewn with rocks and debris, adding to the cave's rugged atmosphere."
