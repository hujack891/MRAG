    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game interface showing the crafting menu for a \"Nonary Pill,\" a celestial medicine that permanently and moderately increases maximum stamina. The player has not yet made any of these pills, as indicated by \"Made: 0 / 9.\" Crafting this item requires 360 Will and an ingredient called \"Mind Core,\" which costs 2 (with 8 in possession). The right side of the screen displays the player's current stats, including maximum health, mana, stamina, defense, and various resistances, with a highlighted change showing an increase of 10 in maximum stamina. A character is visible on the right side of the screen, standing in a dimly lit environment with a fire burning in the background."
