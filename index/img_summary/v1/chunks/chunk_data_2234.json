This visual aligns with the described \"beguiling chants\" and the chaotic environment where health decreases, creatures appear, and the pagoda spins faster. The image serves to illustrate the intense and mystical atmosphere of the Pagoda Realm, emphasizing the challenges and supernatural elements players will encounter during the chanting curse."
