It shows a player character traversing a molten lava field toward a bridge in a dark, fiery environment. A green glowing Wisp is visible near the bridge, aligning with the preceding text's mention of collecting a green Wisp underneath the bridge. A large enemy is also present, suggesting potential combat or navigation challenges. The red-dotted circle highlights an object of interest, possibly a collectible or interactable item."
