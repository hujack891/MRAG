    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where a character is holding a flaming weapon, possibly a sword or staff, and is standing on a wooden platform in a dimly lit cave or cavern. The character is wearing armor and has a glowing blue orb attached to their waist. The game interface displays various icons and gauges, including health and stamina bars at the bottom left corner. There is a red dashed circle on the right side of the image, highlighting an area on the cave wall, possibly indicating an objective or point of interest. The environment is dark, with scattered rocks and a faint glow from the weapon illuminating the surroundings."
