    "img_summary": "The image depicts a large, menacing boar-like creature with glowing red eyes and prominent tusks, set against a dark, foreboding forest environment. The creature's dark fur and the eerie atmosphere suggest it may be an enemy or boss encounter in the game. The background features twisted, leafless trees and a misty, dimly lit setting, enhancing the ominous mood. There are no visible UI components or text hints in the image, focusing solely on the creature and its environment."
