Not to be confused with his brother, the Tiger Vanguard of the Crouching Tiger Temple, you can only reach this boss by following the trail of a ghostly boy using the Old Rattle-Drum Key Item.\n* Rewards: Mad Tiger Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Yaoguai Core x1, Stone Spirit x1, 1102 Experience, 1023 Will, Plaguebane Gourd (in chest)\n## Mad Tiger Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\nThe ostracized brother of the Tiger Vanguard, the Mad Tiger may not have his sword, but he’s a violent powerhouse of a boss that’s even more dangerous and possibly more difficult than the other two Tiger bosses. As such, you’ll want to equip yourself with the best possible gear in Chapter 2 — you may even want to complete the chapter and return back from Chapter 3 if you find yourself unable to make a dent in this boss. Make sure you’re stocked up on medicines to help bolster your damage output and damage reduction.\n\nExpect this fight to take a lot of practice, and considerable upgrades in skills on your part to deal enough damage to survive the fight. While most Rock Solid deflections won’t be enough to stop him, retaliating with charged heavy strikes or crashing an Immobilize can sometimes stagger him several times and give you several openings. Using the Azure Dust Transformation is also useful to soak up his most damaging combos and retaliate with heavy charged hits to take chunks off his health.\n\nKeep practicing against dodging his moves, finding the right times to deflect the end of his combos (or just use Cloud Step to get out of the way) and always watch carefully when you stagger him to avoid his rising grab. Having the concoction to increase your max health can be beneficial if you’re unable to evade his grab or lengthy combos.",

It shows a character approaching a large wooden chest in a dimly lit cave environment, likely the bottom of the well mentioned in the guide. This chest is significant as it contains the Plaguebane Gourd, a reward obtained after defeating the Mad Tiger miniboss. The image serves to illustrate the location where players can find the chest and claim their reward after the challenging fight."
