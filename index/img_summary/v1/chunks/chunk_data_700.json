    "img_summary": "The image shows a third-person view of a character navigating through a narrow, ancient stone corridor towards a structure with a pagoda-like roof. The character is holding a long weapon, possibly a spear. A red dashed circle in the center of the screen highlights a specific target or point of interest ahead. The UI displays various icons and meters: a health bar at the bottom left, and ability icons at the bottom right. The environment is detailed with overgrown grass and weathered stone walls, suggesting an abandoned or historical setting."
