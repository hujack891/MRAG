    "img_summary": "The image displays the equipment menu from a video game, focusing on a rare item called the \"Plaguebane Gourd.\" This item, when used, halves health recovery but temporarily increases attack power. The menu provides details about the gourd's effects, including drinks and soaks that enhance its use. The \"10-Year-Old Coconut Wine\" recovers 43% of maximum health, with older wine offering greater recovery. \"Laurel Buds\" increase damage reduction for a short duration. The UI shows various character stats like health (570), attack (310), and defense (320), along with currency (37075) and another resource (1). The character is holding the green gourd, and the menu offers options to equip, examine, or return."
