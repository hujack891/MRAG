    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene from a video game set in a snowy mountainous environment. A character, possibly the player, is engaged in battle with a large enemy wielding a sword and emitting fiery and electrical effects. The enemy appears to be a formidable opponent with a distinct design featuring antler-like protrusions. The user interface on the left side of the image provides attack options: \"Light Attack 'Moon Dance'\" (X button), \"Heavy Attack 'Moon Chase'\" (Y button), and a combination move \"Follow Dodge with Heavy Attack\" (B + Y buttons). At the bottom, a health bar labeled \"Cyan Loong\" suggests the enemy's name and current health status. Additionally, there are icons on the bottom right, possibly indicating abilities or items available to the player."
