    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a rocky cave environment. The player character, seen from a third-person perspective, is wielding a weapon that emits a fiery glow, suggesting an attack or combat stance. In the distance, an enemy with a visible health bar above its head is approaching, indicating an imminent battle. The user interface (UI) displays several elements: in the bottom left, there are icons likely representing abilities or items, and a health bar with a white, blue, and green section, possibly indicating different health or stamina levels. In the bottom right, more icons are present, which could be related to character skills or actions, with button prompts labeled \"RT\" and \"LT,\" suggesting controller inputs. The environment is dimly lit, with warm lighting emanating from the enemy's direction, enhancing the cave's atmosphere."
