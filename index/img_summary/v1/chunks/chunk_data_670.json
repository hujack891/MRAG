    "img_summary": "The image depicts a detailed in-game model of a golden, multi-headed lion statue, which appears to be a collectible or significant item within the game. The statue is intricately designed, with multiple lion heads stacked vertically, and is set on a dark, swirling base that resembles twisted wood or roots.
