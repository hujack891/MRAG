The character is positioned near a dark opening in the wall, suggesting a possible entrance. A prompt appears on the screen indicating the player can \"Go In\" by pressing the RT button. The user interface displays various elements: a health bar in the top right corner showing a value of 45, a resource labeled \"Will\" with a count of 55, and several icons in the bottom left and center representing abilities or items.
