    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a dark, rocky environment with barren trees and large stone statues. A character, possibly the player, is visible in the foreground holding a staff-like weapon, suggesting readiness for combat. The image highlights an enemy positioned on a staircase in the midground, indicated by a red arrow and a circular marker, suggesting this enemy is a target or point of interest. The environment appears to be a desolate, mountainous area, potentially challenging for navigation or combat. The visual cues suggest the player should focus on engaging or avoiding the enemy on the stairs."
