Zhu Bajie, now bewitched, is shown in a hostile form during the boss fight, surrounded by a muddy and eerie environment. The glowing red eyes and chaotic effects emphasize his aggressive state, as the player engages in combat to free him from the Crimson Spider's influence. The health bar and interface elements suggest an intense battle requiring strategic gameplay."
