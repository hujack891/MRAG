Though the boss has two phases, you may not have as much trouble as you did with The Scorpionlord, since you won't have to deal with poison, and their attacks are a bit easier to read and counter. Strangely enough, it also starts the fight at around 75% of its health, but it does have a second health bar waiting, so pacing yourself can be the key to this fight.\n\nIf it raises its right hoof, be prepared for a quick slam, after which it can either flap away quickly to retreat from any counters you might have in mind, or it will rear back its head and -- after a short delay -- slam it into the ground.
