    "img_summary": "The image depicts a large, mythical creature resembling a stag with prominent antlers, lying on a snowy terrain. The creature appears to be injured or defeated, as indicated by its posture.

The environment is a wintry landscape with scattered rocks and patches of grass, and red-leaved trees in the background add contrast to the scene. There are no visible UI components or text hints in the image, focusing solely on the interaction between the character and the creature within this atmospheric setting."
