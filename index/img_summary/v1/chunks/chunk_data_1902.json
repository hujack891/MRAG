    "img_summary": "The image shows the equipment menu from a video game, focusing on the \"Rat Imperial Guard\" spirit. This spirit is classified as \"Rare\" and has a moderate Qi cost. The description suggests that it allows the player to take the form of the Rat Imperial Guard, enabling nimble attacks by circling and slicing targets unexpectedly. The equipped effect moderately increases focus gained from perfect dodges. The interface includes options to equip the spirit, watch a demo, and close the demo. On the right side, player stats are displayed, including health, attack, defense, and various percentages related to gameplay mechanics. The menu includes tabs for Self-Advance, Relics, Inventory, Journal, and Settings, with controls for details, examining, and returning."
