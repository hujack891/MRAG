    "img_summary": "The image depicts a blacksmith character working at a forge in a detailed outdoor environment. The setting includes a traditional-style building with tiled roofing, surrounded by lush greenery and weathered stone paths. The blacksmith is hammering a large sword on an anvil, with tools and materials scattered nearby, including a furnace glowing with fire. This scene likely represents a crafting or upgrade station where players can enhance weapons or gear. The absence of UI elements suggests this is a cinematic or in-game visual moment focused on the blacksmith's role in gameplay."
