The environment features mysterious, twisted tree-like formations in the distance, adding an ethereal atmosphere. This moment aligns with the narrative described in the \"Birthstone - Heart of Birthstone\" section of the walkthrough, where the Old Monkey transports Wukong across the water while reciting memories, symbolizing a reflective and pivotal point in the game's final chapter."
