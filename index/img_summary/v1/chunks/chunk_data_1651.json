A character, likely the player in *Black Myth: Wukong*, is shown running up the stairs while holding a staff. This scene appears to be part of the journey to locate the Black Loong secret boss in Chapter 2, as described in the preceding text. The staircase may lead to the Keeper's Shrine in Yellow Wind Ridge, a key location for progressing toward the boss encounter."
