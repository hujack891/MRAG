    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game showing the equipment menu. The selected item is a rare spirit called \"Wolf Assassin,\" which has a moderate Qi cost. The spirit's ability, \"Soul Reaper,\" allows the player to take the form of the Wolf Assassin and throw out knives that claim lives from a distance. The equipped effect slightly increases the player's critical hit chance. The menu also displays various other spirits that can be selected, along with the player's stats such as health, attack, defense, and other attributes. The player has the option to equip the spirit or watch a demo of its abilities."
