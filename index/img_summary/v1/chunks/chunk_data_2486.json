    "img_summary": "The image displays a game menu focused on the \"Equipment\" section, specifically highlighting the \"Wolf Assassin\" spirit. This spirit is categorized as rare and has a moderate Qi cost. Its ability, \"Soul Reaper,\" allows the player to take the form of a Wolf Assassin and throw knives to eliminate enemies from a distance. The equipped effect slightly increases the player's critical hit chance. The UI shows various spirits available for selection, each with distinct appearances. On the right side, the player's stats are visible, including health, stamina, and other attributes. The interface provides options to equip the spirit, watch a demo, and sort spirits by acquisition order. The top bar includes navigation options like Inventory, Journal, and Settings, along with currency and spirit counts."
