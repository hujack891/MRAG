The user interface shows various elements: on the left, there are icons for abilities or items, with one showing a count of 97; at the bottom center, there is a health bar with three segments; and on the right, there are additional ability icons marked with RT and LT, indicating controls for activating them. A dialogue at the bottom reads, \"The Wind Tamer... How is it yours to use?\" suggesting a narrative element related to the character's powers."
