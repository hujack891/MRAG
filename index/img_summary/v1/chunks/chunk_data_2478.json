    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game, showing a character standing on a wooden platform in a dark, forested environment. The character is holding a staff with a glowing orange tip. A red arrow indicates a path or direction to follow, leading downwards. The game's user interface displays various elements: a health or stamina bar at the bottom left, a \"Will\" counter with a value of 540 on the right, and several icons representing abilities or items. The scene is dimly lit, with some green foliage visible on the rocks and ground."
