    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character, equipped with a staff, is navigating a rocky and grassy environment. The character appears to be crouching, suggesting stealth or preparation for combat. In the distance, a red circular marker highlights a potential target or point of interest, possibly an enemy or objective. The environment is dimly lit, with a fire providing some illumination near the marked area. The user interface displays various icons and meters at the bottom corners of the screen, indicating health, abilities, or items available to the player.
