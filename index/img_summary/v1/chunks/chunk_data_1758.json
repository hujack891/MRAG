    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from a video game showing the equipment menu. The highlighted item is an epic spirit called \"Non-White,\" which has a high Qi cost. Its ability, \"Bone Spikes,\" allows the player to transform into Non-White, spin, and leap to draw near the target, sprouting thorns to stab them. This ability can be activated in combat by pressing the F key. The equipped effect of this spirit moderately increases poison and frost damage. The player's stats are displayed on the right side, including health, attack power, and various resistances."
