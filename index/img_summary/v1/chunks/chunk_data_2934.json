    "img_summary": "The image depicts a serene forest setting with bamboo trees, moss-covered rocks, and a pathway leading to a shrine-like structure in the background. A character, likely the protagonist of *Black Myth: Wukong*, is seen approaching an NPC near the shrine, emphasizing interaction. This aligns with the preceding text's advice to \"Always Speak to NPCs,\" highlighting the importance of engaging with characters to uncover unique items or opportunities, especially in secret areas. The visual reinforces the game's exploration and interaction mechanics within its immersive environment."
