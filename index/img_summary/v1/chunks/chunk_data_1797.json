A character, wielding a large staff or weapon, is positioned in front of a tall, intricate gate made of twisted, organic-looking bars. The gate appears to be slightly open, revealing a dark space beyond with a faint green light visible. The game's user interface displays various icons and meters, including health and ability indicators, in the bottom corners of the screen."
