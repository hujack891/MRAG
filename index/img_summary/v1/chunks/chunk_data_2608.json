The mask offers basic defense and a unique effect that temporarily boosts attack after using a gourd, while prolonged avoidance of the gourd reduces attack. The Snout Mask is acquired by defeating the boar man in Fright Cliff during Chapter 2. It can be upgraded with Silk in Chapter 3. The image is part of the Snout Mask document, illustrating its appearance and attributes within the game's equipment menu."
