The screen shows that each level of the Endurance talent reduces the stamina cost of sprinting. This is likely part of the gameplay mechanics described in the \"Front Hills\" section of the document titled \"The Forest of Wolves,\" where players can gain their first level up and acquire a \"Spark\" to enhance their abilities. The image serves to illustrate the process of leveling up and the benefits of improving specific talents in the game."
