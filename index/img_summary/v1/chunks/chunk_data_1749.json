    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene from a video game set in a rocky, cobblestone environment. The player character is engaged in battle, surrounded by fiery effects and motion blur, suggesting fast-paced action. Two attack options are displayed on the left: \"Light Attack 'Moon Dance'\" (focused on slashing and building Focus) and \"Heavy Attack 'Moon Chase'\" (a series of dash attacks). The health bar at the bottom indicates the enemy's name as \"Non-White,\" and the text \"This is my part!\" appears as dialogue. The interface includes icons for abilities or items in the bottom-right corner."
