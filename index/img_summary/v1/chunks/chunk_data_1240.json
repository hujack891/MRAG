    "img_summary": "The image shows an in-game menu screen focused on the \"Equipment\" section. A bell-shaped item is prominently displayed in the center, featuring engraved text and cut-out designs. The background is dark, with a shadowy figure partially visible, suggesting an ominous atmosphere. The top menu bar includes options such as Self-Advance, Relics, Inventory, Journal, and Settings. The UI displays currency or points (13391) and another value (50) in the top right corner. At the bottom, controls for exiting the examination (T) and returning (O) are indicated. The screen is likely part of a role-playing or adventure game where equipment management is crucial for gameplay."
