    "img_summary": "The image depicts a gameplay scene from the Elder Jinchi boss fight in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The player character, armed with a staff, is engaged in combat within a dimly lit arena. The glowing particles and shambling enemies suggest the phase where Elder Jinchi summons bodies that slowly move toward the center of the arena to restore his health. The boss's health bar is visible at the bottom, emphasizing the ongoing battle. This visual aligns with the guide's description of Elder Jinchi's mechanics and strategies for this challenging encounter."
