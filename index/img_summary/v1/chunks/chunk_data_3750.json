Below you'll find a guide both for exploring the optional area of the Windrest Hamlet and the Tiger's Acolyte, as well as the final main boss fight against the Yellow Wind Sage.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Windrest Bridge**\n* **Windrest Hamlet**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Tiger's Acolyte\n* **Windseal Gate**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Gore-Eye Daoist\n* Yaoguai King - Yellow Wind Sage\nThe Yellow Wind Formation is the final sub-region you’ll need to explore in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong to reach the Chapter Boss, but also includes a large optional village area of Windrest, and several paths leading to the boss from sealed stone doors. With multiple entrances and exits to this area, we’ll start with the first Shrine on the other side of the Crouching Tiger Temple.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Yellow Wind Sage\nThe final boss of Chapter 2 is a hulking rat who holds an incredible trident spear in one hand, while the other carries… a giant head? If you think this may limit his moves, you’re unfortunately in for a rude awakening. The Yellow Wind Sage has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, and is not only a deadly attacker, but a master of the Samadhi Winds — but more on that later.\nMake sure you're suitably prepared for the fight in the best ways possible: Craft a bunch of medicine to increase your damage absorption and max health, and allocate any Mind Cores you’ve found toward Celestial Medicine buffs. You should also have a full set of either the Galeguard or Insect armor fully crafted, as well as the Cloud-Patterened Stone Staff from defeating the optional Sihandang boss. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you’ve beaten the Chapter 2 Secret Boss and equipped the new Vessel, the Wind Tamer.\n\nOne of the more terrifying attacks in this phase comes when the Yellow Wind Sage lets out a large roar. This will summon a new sand creation to come flying in from above, and if you beat the secret boss in the Kingdom of Sahalin you’ll recognize the towering form of Fuban the Scarab Guai. He’ll essentially crash down on you like a meteor, which will either require good timing with a dodge or try to Rock Solid and soak the blow. Just be wary that if you get hit, you’ll take a huge amount of damage!",
