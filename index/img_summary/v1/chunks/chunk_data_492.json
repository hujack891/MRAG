    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense battle scene between two large, fiery creatures in a video game. The creature on the left is performing a powerful attack, with flames erupting from its fist as it clashes with the creature on the right, which has a menacing, beast-like appearance with glowing red eyes and a body adorned with skulls. The user interface on the left side of the screen provides gameplay instructions, highlighting a \"Heavy Attack\" called \"Earthshatter Slam\" and a \"Spell\" named \"Rock Solid,\" with corresponding controls. At the bottom, a health bar labeled \"Erlang Shen\" indicates the player's or enemy's health status, and a text hint reads, \"Only by enduring flames can you earn his title!\" This suggests a challenge or objective related to the battle."
