Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.\n\nFinally (and possibly most terrifyingly), she can hover high into the air and create a giant group of her electrified spears all around her, sending volleys of them outward in several directions to track you down. Try not to panic, and use Cloud Step to give her the slip, or keep strafing and dodging as much as you can.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts the intense boss fight against Kang-Jin Star, a key Yaoguai King enemy encountered on Turtle Island in Chapter 3 of the game. The scene showcases Kang-Jin Star hovering in the air, surrounded by electrified energy, preparing to unleash a powerful lightning-based attack. The player character is positioned on snowy terrain below, ready to engage in combat. This visual emphasizes the boss's use of electricity and the need for strategic movement and preparation, as described in the guide, including the use of Shock-Quelling medicine and evasive techniques like Cloud Step."
