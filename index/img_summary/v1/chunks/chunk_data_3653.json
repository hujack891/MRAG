Yellowbrow, adorned in golden armor, is unleashing a powerful lightning attack, with bolts and energy motes scattered across the battlefield. The player character, Wukong, is seen evading the attack amidst the chaos, highlighting the intensity of the final phase of the battle. This scene aligns with the preceding text, which describes Yellowbrow's use of a giant lightning blast and the need for strategic movement or abilities like the Wind Tamer to counter it. The image visually reinforces the narrative of the boss's escalating difficulty and the player's struggle to survive."
