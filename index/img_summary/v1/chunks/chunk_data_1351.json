    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character is running up a rocky staircase in a canyon-like environment. The character is holding a staff and appears to be wearing rugged clothing. The environment is detailed with rocky textures and sparse vegetation, illuminated by small fires along the path. The user interface displays several elements: on the left, there is a hexagonal menu with icons for different items or abilities, and on the bottom, there are health and stamina bars. On the right, there is a circular map or radar with icons indicating nearby points of interest or objectives. The UI suggests the player has access to various abilities or items, and the environment indicates a potentially challenging terrain to navigate."
