    "img_summary": "The image shows a stealth-focused gameplay moment in a snowy, wooden bridge environment. The player character is crouched, wearing tattered clothing and holding a weapon, likely preparing for a stealth attack.

The user interface (UI) includes a health bar, a posture bar, and various ability icons in the bottom corners, indicating available tools or skills. The setting suggests a need for careful navigation and stealth tactics to progress."
