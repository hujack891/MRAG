The Wight is much tougher than any other bosses you can fight this early in the game, and while it is still possible to defeat them early, it is highly recommended that you level up further before taking them on.\n* Rewards: Wandering Wight Spirit, Cat’s Eye Beads, Stone Spirit, 691 Will, 1,049 Experience\n## Wandering Wight Boss Fight and Guide\nAs mentioned before, the Wandering Wight is an extremely tough opponent to challenge as early as you encounter him in Chapter 1. It’s highly recommended you run past him on your first encounter and return to fight after gaining better gear and abilities. We recommend coming back to challenge him after getting through most of the Bamboo Forest region of Black Wind Mountain — especially due to the fact that one of the rewards from the Wandering Wight can’t be accessed until you gain an upgrade in the Bamboo Forest.\nIf you do try to fight him early, we at least recommend making a quick detour left of the Wandering Wight to fight a much more manageable optional Yaoguai Chief — Guangzhi — as he drops a Transformation Spell that can be instrumental in surviving this fight.\nDo be warned however, that you should defeat this optional boss before you unlock the Chapter 1 Secret Area by ringing three large bells. Once you challenge the boss of the Ancient Guanyin Temple, the Wandering Wight will disappear, and you will no longer be able to challenge him and gain his rewards!\n\nEven worse, some of his combos can add with him performing an extremely fast leaping stomp attack, which covers a good amount of distance and is hard to react to when the speed is much faster than his other stomps.",
