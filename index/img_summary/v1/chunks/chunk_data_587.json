    "img_summary": "The image shows the equipment menu from a video game, highlighting a rare item called \"Charface.\" This item has a moderate Qi cost and is described as \"Magma Forged,\" allowing the player to take the form of Charface and use a lava-forged blade to cause magma bursts that damage nearby enemies. The item also moderately increases charging speed. The menu displays various character stats on the right, such as health, attack power, and defense. The left side shows a selection of different spirits that can be equipped. The user interface includes options for self-advance, relics, inventory, journal, and settings. There is also a small in-game demonstration of the item in use."
