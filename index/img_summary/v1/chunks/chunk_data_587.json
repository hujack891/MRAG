    "img_summary": "The image displays a video game interface focused on the \"Equipment\" section. It features a selection of \"Spirits\" on the left side, showcasing various spirit icons. The highlighted spirit is \"Charface,\" described as \"Rare\" with a moderate Qi cost. The ability \"Magma Forged\" allows the player to take the form of Charface, using a lava-forged blade to create a magma burst that damages nearby foes. The equipped effect moderately increases charging speed. The interface includes options to watch a demo, equip the spirit, and displays player stats such as health, stamina, and other attributes on the right side."
