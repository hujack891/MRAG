    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character, holding a staff, is positioned in a dimly lit cave environment. The character stands near a stone platform with a lit candle and a glowing object, possibly a treasure chest or container, which can be interacted with using the \"RT\" button, as indicated by the \"Open\" prompt. The user interface includes a health bar at the bottom left, showing white and blue segments, and several hexagonal icons suggesting abilities or items available to the player. Additional icons are visible at the bottom right, possibly representing skills or actions, each labeled with \"RT\" or other button prompts. The environment is rocky and dark, with stalactites visible in the background, enhancing the cave-like atmosphere."
