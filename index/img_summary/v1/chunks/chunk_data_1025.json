It will spin around while spewing fire from the front to try and get you. When this happens, stick close to it and spin with it. If you get caught with this move, throw on the Fireproof Mantle to negate some of the fire damage. Another variation you'll see is it spitting fireballs. For this move, it will aim the fireballs and spit them out, and you can dash out of the way to miss them entirely.\n\nLastly is the difference in punches. The cart will lunge and take swipes at you but also punch the ground like the other carts. To make things trickier, it will also try to grab you.\n\nWhen it does go to take a swipe at you, try to roll toward it.
