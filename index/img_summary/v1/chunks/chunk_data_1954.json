    "img_summary": "The image is split into two sections, both depicting scenes from a video game set in a cave-like environment with rocky terrain and warm, orange lighting. On the left, a character is seen moving through the cave, holding a staff or spear, with a large red arrow pointing towards a specific area, possibly indicating a direction or point of interest. On the right, the same character is crouched near a large pot highlighted with a red dotted circle, suggesting it is an interactive or important object. The user interface displays icons in the bottom right corner, which may represent health, abilities, or inventory items. This image likely serves as a guide to navigate the cave and interact with key objects."
