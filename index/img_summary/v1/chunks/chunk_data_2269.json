    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy forest environment. A player character, camouflaged in foliage, is advancing toward a large enemy creature with glowing green hands. The creature is significantly larger than the player, indicating a potential boss fight or challenging encounter. The user interface (UI) displays various elements: a health bar with multiple segments at the bottom center, indicating the player's health status, and several ability icons on the left and right sides, suggesting available skills or items. The presence of button prompts (e.g., LB, RT) indicates the game is played with a controller. The environment and UI suggest a focus on strategic combat and resource management."
