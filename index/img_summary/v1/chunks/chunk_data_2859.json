Though the boss has two phases, you may not have as much trouble as you did with The Scorpionlord, since you won't have to deal with poison, and their attacks are a bit easier to read and counter.

If you're already low on stamina from deflecting the first attack, you're better off running to the side to avoid them.\n\nThe good news is that his loud crow leaves enough time for you to interrupt the attack entirely by hitting him with a charged attack or Spirit Attack, cancelling the move entirely.\n\nOnce you know where and when his sword will appear, the rest of the fight will come down to waiting for openings after his big attack to hit him hard, using your Spirit Attacks and Transformation Spells in this phase to speed things up.
