    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense action scene from a video game, set in a snowy forest environment. A large explosion dominates the right side of the image, with debris and fiery particles scattering in all directions. In the foreground, a character or enemy is partially visible, seemingly caught in the explosion. The user interface (UI) displays various elements: in the bottom left corner, there are hexagonal icons indicating available actions or items, and a health bar with a white, black, and blue gradient. On the bottom right, additional circular icons suggest abilities or equipment, with button prompts like \"RT\" and \"RB\" indicating controls for a console. A small health bar above the explosion suggests an enemy is taking damage. The scene suggests a combat encounter, highlighting the player's use of explosive attacks or abilities."
