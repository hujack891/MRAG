    "img_summary": "The image shows a third-person perspective of a character walking through a snowy environment, wielding a large, ornate staff. The area is an open, mountainous terrain with snow-covered rocks and a distant wooden bridge visible in the background. The user interface (UI) includes a health and stamina bar at the bottom left, along with hexagonal icons indicating abilities or items. On the bottom right, additional icons and button prompts (e.g., \"RT\") suggest actions or skills tied to specific controls. A circular minimap is also present, showing the character's position and nearby points of interest. This scene likely involves exploration or preparation for combat in a harsh, wintry setting."
