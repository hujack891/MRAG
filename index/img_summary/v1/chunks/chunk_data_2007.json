    "img_summary": "The image displays a game menu screen focused on the \"Equipment\" section, highlighting a rare item called \"Snake Sheriff.\" This item has a low Qi cost and features a special ability named \"Tiger Roar,\" which allows the player to transform into the Snake Sheriff, extending its neck to roar and affect nearby enemies called yaoguais. The equipped effect moderately increases attack but significantly reduces defense. The player's level is 102, with various basic attributes listed, including health, mana, stamina, attack, and defense, as well as resistances to different banes like chill, burn, poison, and shock.
