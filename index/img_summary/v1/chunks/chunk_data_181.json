The creature is partially submerged in water, surrounded by several large, tentacle-like appendages. The setting is a snowy landscape with traditional Japanese architecture visible in the background, including a pagoda and a stone lantern. The game's interface shows various icons and a health bar for Chen Loong, indicating the creature's remaining health. A text at the bottom of the screen reads, \"To the deepest trench I dive!\" suggesting a narrative or dialogue element in the game."
