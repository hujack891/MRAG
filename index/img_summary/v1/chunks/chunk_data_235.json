    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy landscape within the Precept Corridor section of the Bitter Lake region in the game Black Myth: Wukong. A character, possibly Wukong, is seen descending a slope towards a crowned Buddha statue, which is a significant point of interest in the walkthrough. The statue is positioned near a stone slab, suggesting a narrative role as a location to pray or interact within the game. The image serves to guide players to this specific spot, highlighting the Buddha statue's importance in the progression through the Precept Corridor."
