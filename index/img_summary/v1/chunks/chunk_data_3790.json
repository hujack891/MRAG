Upon reaching Chapter 4 in the Webbed Hollow, he will become bewitched, and will need your help to free himself of the lure of the Crimson Spider.\n* Rewards: Blood Stained Needle, Jade Moon Rabbit Curio, Fine Gold Thread, 3410 Experience x2, 2578-2612 Will x2\n## Zhu Bajie Boss Fight and Guide - First Encounter\nYour old friend Zhu Bajie is not exactly himself, and now that he's been bewitched, you'll have to beat some sense into him. This is no easy task, as the scrappy little pig once journeyed with Wukong himself. This makes him a wily fighter, if a bit unorthodox.\nZhu Bajie prefers to attack with his special 9-pointed rake, and while it may look silly, it's absolutely dangerous. He can swing it in wide arcs in a few different ways, but he usually has a slow wind-up at first that you can dodge away from.\n\nThanks to his clumsiness, and that he's prone to stumbling back and falling when staggered by big hits, you'll have a lot of opportunities to unleash your charged up hits and Spirit Attacks on him, but you'll still want to be ready to go on the defensive any time you see him flare up with energy.",
