Thankfully this will only lower your maximum health by around a fourth, and still give you a damage boost in return. The effect doesn't last forever -- only for around a full minute -- so make the most of it!",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic moment during the Yaoguai King Boss Fight against Captain Wise-Voice in *The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm*. The glowing, golden figure surrounded by twisted roots likely represents the boss as it prepares or executes its \"beguiling chant\" ability, which temporarily reduces the player's maximum health while granting a damage boost. The dark, atmospheric environment and visible player interface suggest this is an intense combat sequence within the game."
