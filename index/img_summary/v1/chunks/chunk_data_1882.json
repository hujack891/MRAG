    "img_summary": "The image displays the equipment menu from a video game, showcasing a selection of spirits that the player can choose from. The highlighted spirit is the \"Puppet Spider,\" categorized as a rare item with a moderate Qi cost. Its ability, \"Venom Claw,\" allows the player to transform into the Puppet Spider and attack foes with repeated fang strikes. The equipped effect of this spirit moderately slows the decay of Might. The UI includes options to equip the spirit, watch a demo, and sort spirits by acquisition order. On the right side, player stats such as health, attack, defense, and various percentages are visible, indicating current levels and changes. A small demo video shows the Puppet Spider in action within a forest environment."
