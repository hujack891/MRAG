    "img_summary": "The image depicts a rocky, desolate landscape with a humanoid creature as the central figure. The creature appears to be a grotesque, red-skinned being, holding a large, red shield shaped like an ear. It stands on a path surrounded by jagged rocks and sparse vegetation. In the background, there are stone structures resembling pagodas, suggesting an ancient or mystical setting. The environment is dimly lit, creating a somber and eerie atmosphere.
