    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character stands in a cave-like environment filled with rocks and webs. The character is equipped with a staff that emits a fiery glow, suggesting a magical or combat role. A large boulder is highlighted with a red arrow, possibly indicating an interactive or significant object within the game. The environment is dimly lit, with a hanging lantern providing some illumination. Statues carved into the cave walls suggest an ancient or mystical setting. The image likely serves as a guide to draw attention to the boulder, which may be a puzzle element or obstacle to overcome."
