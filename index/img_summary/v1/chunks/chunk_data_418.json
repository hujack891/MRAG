    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character is facing a large, spider-like enemy named \"Centipede Guai.\" The environment is dark and cave-like, with scattered bones and skulls on the ground, adding to the ominous atmosphere. The enemy is large and intimidating, with multiple legs and a segmented body. The user interface (UI) shows the player's health and stamina bars at the bottom left, while the enemy's health bar, labeled \"Centipede Guai,\" is displayed at the bottom center. Various icons and abilities are visible on the left and right sides of the screen, indicating available actions or powers the player can use during the encounter. This setup suggests a boss battle scenario where the player must strategically manage resources and abilities to defeat the formidable foe."
