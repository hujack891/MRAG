Whenever you see them, focus on attacking one and luring it closer to other enemies, to take advantage of their explosive abilities. When they're in groups, and each one has a low health bar, this can sometimes cause a chain of explosions as they knock each other out one by one.\n\nExit the little cave and continue on, where you'll see two more Revenant Charbones with a larger figure (a Revenant Charface) straight ahead. Clear these out first, and be careful of the fast slashing attacks from the Revenant Charface, which also continues once you've killed it.\n\nWhen it's safe, turn back on yourself. The Fire Bellflower that was on the left as you exited the small cave will now be on the right, and you'll see a path on the right that leads to the next section.",

A red highlighted marker indicates a specific point of interest near the cave's entrance. This scene corresponds to the \"Camp of Seasons\" section in the \"Woods of Ember Walkthrough\" document. The preceding text advises players to exit the cave and be cautious of enemies, specifically Revenant Charbones and a Revenant Charface, indicating that the image serves to visually guide players on where to go next in the game. The marker likely points to the Fire Bellflower mentioned in the text, which players should locate as they proceed."
