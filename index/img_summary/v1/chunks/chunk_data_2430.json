    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a lush, cave-like environment. A character, wielding a flaming torch, stands in the foreground, suggesting exploration or combat readiness. The user interface (UI) displays various elements: a health bar at the bottom left, indicating the player's health status, and several icons on both sides representing abilities or items, which can be activated using specific controls (e.g., R1, R2). A red circular marker on the ground highlights an interactable object, possibly a quest item or a point of interest. The environment features dense foliage and rocky formations, adding to the immersive atmosphere."
