    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene in a video game set in a rugged, rocky environment with dry grass. Two characters are engaged in battle; the character in the foreground is wielding a large weapon, possibly a sword or staff, while the enemy in the background has a visible health bar above their head, indicating they are an opponent. The user interface displays various icons and bars: on the bottom left, there are five hexagonal icons likely representing abilities or items; a health and stamina bar is visible, with the health bar partially depleted; on the bottom right, there are circular icons that might represent character stats or abilities, with button prompts labeled \"RT\" and \"LT.\" The scene suggests an active combat scenario requiring strategic use of abilities and monitoring of health and stamina."
