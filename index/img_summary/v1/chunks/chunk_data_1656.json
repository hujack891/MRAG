    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a player character, seen from behind, is facing a large, ornate door or wall covered in swirling papers or debris. The character is wearing a cloak made of dark, tattered material and is holding a weapon. The environment appears to be a dimly lit, ancient temple or ruin. The user interface (UI) includes several elements: on the bottom left, there are icons for items or abilities, with a health and stamina bar above them. On the bottom right, additional ability icons and button prompts (e.g., RT, LT) are visible, suggesting actions the player can take. The text \"Non-Void\" appears at the bottom center, possibly indicating the name of a location or an objective. This scene likely involves a significant event or battle, given the dramatic visual effects and the presence of UI elements indicating player status and abilities."
