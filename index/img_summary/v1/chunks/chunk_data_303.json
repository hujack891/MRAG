It shows a character, likely the protagonist, running up a wooden walkway towards a set of stone steps, with a flaming torch on the side. The setting is outdoors, surrounded by lush vegetation and ruins, indicating the character's progression towards the mountaintop. This image serves to illustrate the path players should take after encountering Wolf Archers and Sentinels, as described in the preceding text of the walkthrough."
