    "img_summary": "The image depicts a rugged, desolate area in Sandgate Village, part of the \"Old Rattle-Drum Questline\" from *Black Myth: Wukong*. A character, likely the protagonist, is seen navigating through a dry, overgrown landscape surrounded by crumbling stone ruins and barren trees. This setting aligns with the quest's narrative, where players use the Old Rattle-Drum to interact with a boy's spirit and uncover clues about a secret involving a well. The image visually reinforces the eerie and decayed atmosphere of the location described in the text."
