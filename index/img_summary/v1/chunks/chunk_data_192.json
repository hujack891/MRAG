    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game set in a snowy landscape. A character is crouched in the foreground, holding a long staff or weapon, and appears to be hiding or sneaking through the snow. In the background, there is a traditional-looking building with a tiled roof, surrounded by rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. Two figures are visible near the building, possibly engaged in combat or interaction. The game's interface displays various icons and bars, indicating health, abilities, or items. A notification on the screen shows that the player has acquired \"Tree Pearl x1.\" At the bottom of the screen, text reads, \"Don't... Don't get any closer!\" suggesting a warning or dialogue from the game."
