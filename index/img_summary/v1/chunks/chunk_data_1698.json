The environment appears to be a temple-like setting with statues and ornate architecture in the background. The user interface displays health bars at the bottom, with Yellowbrow's health shown as a white bar and the enemy's health as a gray bar. Various icons are present on the left and right sides, likely representing abilities or items available to the player.
