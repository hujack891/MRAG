    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a large, grotesque creature labeled \"Wandering Wight\" is engaged in combat with a smaller character. The environment is a dense forest with sunlight filtering through the trees. The creature is wearing a tattered robe and appears to be mid-attack, while the smaller character is positioned below it, seemingly dodging or preparing to strike. At the bottom of the image, there is a health bar for the \"Wandering Wight,\" indicating the creature's remaining health. On the left side, there are icons displaying the player's resources or abilities, including a flask and a blue bar, likely representing health and stamina or magic."
