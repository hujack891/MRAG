    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene from a video game where a character is engulfed in flames, suggesting a fiery attack or ability in use. The character appears to be wielding a large weapon, possibly an axe. On the left side of the screen, there are text instructions for different attacks: \"Light Attack 'Chop Wood',\" \"Heavy Attack 'Blow Fire',\" and \"Spell 'Fiery Burst',\" each with a brief description of their effects. The bottom of the screen shows a health bar labeled \"Non-Pure,\" indicating the enemy's status, which is nearly depleted. In the bottom right corner, there are icons likely related to the player's abilities or status. The environment appears to be an ancient or medieval stone structure with open doors leading outside."
