The Spirit is described as mythical and has a high Qi cost, with the ability called \"Tongue Whip\" that allows the player to assume the form of a random frog, each with unique elemental attacks such as lightning, mist, filth, flame, and roar. The Spirit also provides an equipped effect that moderately reduces the stamina cost for jumps and jump attacks. The player's character is at level 103, with various attributes and resistances displayed on the right side of the screen."
