    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game set in a snowy, mountainous environment with traditional Japanese architecture. The player character, seen from a third-person perspective, is crouched and appears to be sneaking up on enemies. Two enemies are visible: one is a humanoid creature with a skeletal appearance, and the other is a larger enemy wielding a weapon. The user interface includes various icons on the bottom left and right corners, indicating available abilities or items, and a health bar at the bottom center. The presence of a red marker above one enemy suggests a targeting or alert system, indicating that the player may be preparing for combat or stealth action."
