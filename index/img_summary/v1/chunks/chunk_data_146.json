    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where a character, armed with a staff or spear, is engaged in an intense battle. The environment is a snowy, desolate landscape under a dark, cloudy sky. The character appears to be using a powerful magical attack, as indicated by the bright, electric-like energy beams and circular energy patterns emanating from the ground. The health bar at the bottom of the screen shows the name \"Kang Jin Star,\" suggesting this might be the name of the character or the enemy. Various game interface elements, such as ability icons and a mini-map, are visible on the screen."
