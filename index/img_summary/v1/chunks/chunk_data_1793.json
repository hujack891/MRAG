    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character is exploring a cave-like environment with rocky terrain. The character, seen from behind, is holding a staff and appears to be moving towards a large statue of a seated figure, possibly a deity or monk, which is partially illuminated by a nearby torch. A red circular marker highlights an object or area of interest in front of the statue, suggesting an interactive element or objective. The user interface displays various icons and meters, including a health bar and ability icons, indicating the player's status and available actions. The environment's dim lighting and the presence of the statue suggest a setting of exploration or puzzle-solving."
