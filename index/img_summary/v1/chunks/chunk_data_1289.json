    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where a character, dressed in a yellow robe and carrying a sword, stands on a rocky ledge. The environment is a rugged, canyon-like area with intricate carvings on the walls. Two red arrows are drawn on the image, indicating a path forward across a narrow wooden beam to another ledge and further into a dark opening. The arrows suggest the intended direction for the player to progress in the game. The lighting creates a dramatic contrast, highlighting the path and the detailed textures of the environment."
