    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where a character, seen from behind, is observing a group of five figures in a courtyard. These figures are dressed in dark robes and are wielding swords in a combat stance. The setting appears to be a traditional Asian architectural style with a tiled roof and wooden pillars. The character in the foreground is holding a staff and has a detailed, ornate design on their back. The game interface displays various icons and a health or stamina bar at the bottom of the screen. The environment is lush with greenery, suggesting an outdoor setting."
