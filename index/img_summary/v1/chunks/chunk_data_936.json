    "img_summary": "The image is from a video game interface focused on the \"Equipment\" section, specifically showcasing the \"Flint Vanguard\" spirit, categorized as Epic with a high Qi cost. The description indicates that using Flint Vanguard allows the player to take its form and attack enemies with stone fists, applying Scorch Bane with each strike. If the enemy is ignited, they suffer additional burn damage over time. The equipped effect moderately increases scorch damage and burn resistance. The UI includes options to equip the spirit and watch a demo. On the right, player stats are displayed, including health, various attributes, and percentages related to damage and resistance. The top menu shows sections like Self-Advance, Relics, Inventory, Journal, and Settings, with the player having 202733 currency and 2 special points."
