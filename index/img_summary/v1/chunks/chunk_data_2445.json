    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character sitting on a wooden platform in a dimly lit environment, possibly a cave or dungeon. The character is wearing a cloak made of straw or grass-like material, suggesting a rustic or tribal aesthetic. Their footwear is detailed with woven patterns, indicating a focus on texture and design. The setting is dark, with shadows dominating the scene, which may imply a stealth or exploration aspect in the gameplay. The absence of visible UI components suggests this is a cutscene or a scripted event within the game, focusing on narrative or character development."
