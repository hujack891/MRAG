    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong\" known as Non-Able. Set in a snowy, mountainous environment with a pagoda in the background, the character is shown bound and kneeling. This visual likely represents a moment before or after the player confronts Non-Able in the game. The context provided in the document titled \"Non-Able Spirit\" suggests that defeating Non-Able allows the player to absorb his Spirit, granting temporary powers. The image serves to illustrate the appearance and setting of Non-Able, enhancing the narrative about his location, battle, and the powers his Spirit bestows."
