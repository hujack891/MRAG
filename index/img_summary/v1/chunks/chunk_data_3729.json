This boss has a speciality - and it’s creating blood. Lots of it. This blood can be pretty dangerous too, as he’ll be able to create pools of it all around the arena, and even poison you with it, so make sure you’re stocked on a few antimiasma pills.\n\nOne of these blood spells is to basically turn his staff into a firehose, and he’ll spray blood in a frontal arc around him to force you to back off, creating several new pools at his feet. Depending on your positioning, you can either try to dodge behind him, or take a retreating jump and follow up with the thrust stance heavy attack outside of his range.\n\nHe’ll have a few more variations of expelling blood from his staff - either in a concentrated stream straight ahead, or flinging his staff to create a wave of it in front of you, so be ready for waves of blood to fly out whenever he charges up.",
