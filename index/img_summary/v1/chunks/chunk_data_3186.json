    "img_summary": "The image from the \"Village of Lanxi Walkthrough\" under the section \"The Webbed Hollow\" depicts a dark, forested area at night. The player character, likely Wukong, is seen crouching in the foreground, armed with a staff. The environment is lush with grass and trees, and a structure illuminated by red lanterns is visible in the background. A green Wisp, which can be absorbed for benefits, is highlighted near the structure. The image serves to visually guide players through the initial steps of navigating the outskirts of the Village of Lanxi, emphasizing the importance of exploring the area for useful items like the green Wisp and the Fragrant Jade Flower."
