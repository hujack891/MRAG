Two rare items are highlighted: the \"Fine China Tea Bowl,\" which moderately increases the player's stamina recovery rate, and the \"Frostsprout Twig,\" which moderately increases chill resistance. The UI displays various stats on the right side, including health, stamina, and resistances, with specific values and a negative modifier on chill resistance. The top right corner shows the player's currency (19772) and an icon indicating a quantity of 1.
