    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy environment where a character is engaged in combat with a large enemy. The enemy is wielding a weapon and appears to be in mid-attack. The player character is on the ground, suggesting they are in a vulnerable position. The user interface shows a health bar at the bottom left, which is partially depleted, indicating the character has taken damage. There are various icons surrounding the health bar, likely representing abilities or items that can be used during gameplay. On the right side, there are additional icons and a circular gauge, possibly related to the player's status or abilities. The text \"Non-Able\" appears above a horizontal bar, possibly indicating the enemy's name or a status effect. The environment is detailed with snow-covered ground and rocky terrain, setting the scene for the battle."
