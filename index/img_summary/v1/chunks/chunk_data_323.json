    "img_summary": "The image depicts a large, stone-like creature with multiple faces embedded in its body, set against a rocky, mountainous landscape. The creature is named \"Shigandang,\" as indicated by the text overlay. The environment is barren, with dry grass and leafless trees, suggesting a harsh and rugged terrain. The image includes stylized text in both English and another language, possibly Chinese, which adds to the thematic elements of the scene."
