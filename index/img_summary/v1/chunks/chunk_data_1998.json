    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character standing in a rocky, forested environment near a stream. The character is holding a long staff and appears to be wearing a grey outfit with a belt that has a pouch attached. A prompt is visible on the screen, indicating the player can press the \"RT\" button to \"Gather\" resources from a nearby moss-covered rock. This suggests a gameplay mechanic where players can collect items or materials from the environment, likely for crafting or inventory purposes."
