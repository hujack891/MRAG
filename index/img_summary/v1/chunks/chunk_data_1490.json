    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character in a rocky, volcanic environment with visible lava flows in the background. The character is standing next to a tree adorned with glowing yellow orbs, suggesting a resource or collectible. A prompt appears with the text \"RT Gather,\" indicating that the player can interact with the tree to gather items by pressing the RT button on a controller. The user interface shows various icons in the bottom left corner, which may represent abilities, items, or status effects, but they are not clearly visible. The setting suggests a potentially hazardous area due to the proximity of lava."
