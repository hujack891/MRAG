Just treat them as you would any other Sword Daoist, keeping in mind that their greatly expanded health pool should dissuade you from pressing your attack too long so that you can back off to evade their next moves and regain your stamina.",

Like before, much of their attack patterns will follow the basic enemy, so there won't be too much of a surprise in store.",
