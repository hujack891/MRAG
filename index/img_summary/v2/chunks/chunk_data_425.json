    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense moment during a boss fight against \"Captain Wise-Voice\" in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The boss, a grotesque creature with tangled, tree-like appendages, is shown in a staggered state, indicated by glowing damage on its leg. This moment aligns with the preceding text, where the player is advised to exploit the staggered state by targeting the exposed core for maximum damage. The following text suggests strategies for dealing significant damage while maintaining the boss's dazed state, emphasizing the importance of timing and focus management during this phase of the battle."
