After winning that fight, head out the back of Crouching Tiger Temple and work your way through the town that the path winds through. The Rat Imperial Guard is perched on a roof at the end of the town.",
    "img_below_text": "## Rat Imperial Guard Fight\nThe Rat Imperial Guard fight is difficult, not because the foe himself is particularly powerful, but because he has two other Rat Imperial Guards fighting by his side. Rat Imperial Guards are extremely fast and fight with dual-handed scythe-like weapons. Perfect Dodging their swipes will help you out greatly in this battle. It is easy to get overwhelmed in this fight, so try to separate them and pick them off one by one.",
