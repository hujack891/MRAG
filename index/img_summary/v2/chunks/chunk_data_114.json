To get there, reach the Upper Hollow Keeper's Shrine and run up the stairs right next to it. Turn right and start making your way down the path into the caves beyond. It will take a decent amount of time to get there, but if you stick to the right, you will reach the Beetle Captain eventually.",
    "img_below_text": "## Beetle Captain Fight\nThe Beetle Captain fights like all others of its kind. It is armed with two swords that it uses to slash and stab at you. The Beetle Captain also has large, white wings on its back that allow it to fly up into the air and slash you as it crashes back down to the ground. It can also fly up and charge you, stabbing in quick succession with both swords.",
