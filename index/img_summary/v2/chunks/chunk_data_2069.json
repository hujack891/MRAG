    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts the protagonist, Wukong, crouching in a snowy courtyard near a temple structure. He is holding a spear and appears to be in a stealthy stance, preparing to engage or avoid an enemyâ€”a monk-like figure wielding a glowing weapon, positioned on an elevated platform.\n\n2. **Purpose and Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates a moment of tactical gameplay where the player must decide whether to confront or bypass an enemy guarding the temple area. It aligns with the preceding context of navigating through the plaza and encountering monks, and the following context of progressing down the stairs toward additional enemies and challenges. This scene emphasizes stealth and strategic decision-making in the walkthrough."
