    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" showcasing a combat encounter with an Overseeing Monk in a snowy environment. The monk, a blind enemy, is positioned near a sealed doorway and is engaged in a powerful martial arts counterattack against the player character. The narrative suggests that while these monks are stationary, they can be effectively defeated by charging a heavy thrust attack followed by a quick light combo. The image serves to illustrate the strategic approach needed to overcome this enemy type and highlights the game's dynamic combat mechanics."
