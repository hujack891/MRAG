    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a tense moment in the \"Buddha's Right Hand\" boss fight from *Black Myth: Wukong*. The player character is positioned in a narrow, dimly lit hallway, facing a massive, grotesque hand attached to a long arm. The hand appears to be mid-attack, with debris scattered on the ground, emphasizing the confined and perilous environment.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates the challenging and unorthodox nature of the boss fight, highlighting the limited space for movement and the need to anticipate the hand's unpredictable attacks. It visually complements the guide's description of the fight mechanics, such as the hand's slapping move that causes falling rocks, reinforcing the need for strategic dodging and awareness in this claustrophobic setting."
