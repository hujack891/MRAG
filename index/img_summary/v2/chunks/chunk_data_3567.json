The image highlights a broken set of stairs to the right, suggesting an alternative route to bypass the cart by climbing the stairs and running along a small roof to collect a green Wisp. The context indicates that this maneuver will lead the player to the next Keeper's Shrine and set up an encounter with the Yoaguai Chief."
