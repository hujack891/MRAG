The towering structures and cloudy sky enhance the eerie atmosphere. Based on the preceding and following text, this scene likely represents the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, a boss character in the narrative. The image visually emphasizes the tension and danger of the encounter, as players are advised to focus on defeating the revenants before engaging the Keeper one-on-one."
