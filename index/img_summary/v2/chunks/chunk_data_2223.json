    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense battle scene from a video game, featuring a character named \"Non-White\" engaged in combat. The character is seen performing agile maneuvers, likely using a frost sword, as suggested by the preceding text. The image captures the moment where Non-White is executing a fast dash attack, possibly part of the described \"Moon Chase\" heavy attack, which unleashes a series of dash attacks. The narrative context indicates that this is a pivotal moment in the fight, where the player must defeat Non-White, who will soon switch tactics to evade and attack with poison blades. The image serves to illustrate the dynamic and challenging nature of the combat encounter, emphasizing the need for strategic gameplay to overcome the opponent's defenses and adapt to changing attack patterns."
