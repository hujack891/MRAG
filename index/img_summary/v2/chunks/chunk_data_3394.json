    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" featuring the character Zhu Bajie in a muddy, dark environment. Zhu Bajie is shown in his carp form, preparing to attack the player by diving under the mud. The preceding text describes his attack pattern, where he swims forward to dive at the player, making it difficult to predict his resurfacing. The following text indicates that once Zhu Bajie emerges from the mud, he transforms into a large rhino and charges at the player, accompanied by two copies, creating a challenging scenario for dodging. The image serves to illustrate the intense and unpredictable nature of the battle against Zhu Bajie."
