    "img_summary": "The image depicts a barren, rocky clearing with a faint glowing patch on the ground, highlighted by a red arrow. This glowing patch is significant as it marks the location where players can summon the miniboss, the Mother of Flamlings, by offering 4x Flame Ores. The surrounding environment is desolate, reinforcing the need to clear out smaller Flamlings before approaching this area. The image serves as a visual guide to help players identify the summoning spot within the game."
