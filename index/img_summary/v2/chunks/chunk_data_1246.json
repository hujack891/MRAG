The setting includes rocky terrain, a column, and wooden scaffolding, suggesting a small, enclosed pathway. The preceding and following text indicates this area is part of the left-hand path after resting at the Shrine, where players encounter a Bladebone enemy and can absorb the green Wisp in a small room. The image highlights exploration and potential rewards amidst danger."
