As these are perfect dodges, you'll see multiple illusions left behind in its wake, which will explode after a few seconds. To counter this, you'll want to land a few hits, and then jump back to avoid the explosions, but continue to follow up and complete the combos for a heavy attack.",

In terms of Transformations and Spirits, we found that Ebon Flow was useful for deflecting his attacks and quickly building might to perform a powerful finisher, and the Wandering Wight Spirit was able to take down a chunk of his health in one go.\nYou'll see the Great Sage's Broken Shell's version of a heavy attack, as the staff glows gold and he jumps up with his staff to smash it down on you. These moves can also be evaded, to help build up your own focus for a counterattack. Again, you'll want to take advantage of Wukong's arm and staff in this fight, by using the fourth focus point for heavy attacks, and making use of the increased Critical Hit Chance.",
