    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, where the protagonist stands before a mural in a dimly lit cave-like environment. This area is likely part of the game's progression, as the preceding text suggests breaking a wall to access a hidden chest containing the Loong Scales. The mural and surroundings may serve as a narrative or visual clue tied to the game's lore or the upcoming Yellow Loong boss fight."
