    "img_below_text": "The flashing of his fiery weapon may seem impossible to dodge, but the key to this fight is understanding exactly when his attacks actually land so that you can dodge around them. Guangzhi usually starts by charging forth for a combo attack, but each attack will cause him to jump into the air with a flourish before actually attacking with downward swings. Wait to dodge all three swing attacks and then hit him with some of your own while he tries to recover.\n![Wukong Wolves 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1f/Wukong_Wolves_35.jpg)",
