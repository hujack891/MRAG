A red arrow points toward a pathway leading to a structure resembling a shrine or statue on elevated ground. A red circular marker highlights an area of interest on the right, suggesting an item or interaction point.\n\n2. **Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as a visual guide for navigating the Furnace Valley area. It illustrates the player's next steps: moving toward the shrine-like structure while being aware of the marked area on the right, which likely contains the green Wisp mentioned in the following text. This is part of the walkthrough's instructions for progressing through the lava-filled environment and preparing for potential enemy encounters."
