However, if he stands up and pulls one arm back, you can expect a surprisingly far-reaching and fast lunging punch, followed by a slam into the ground.\nOther times, he’ll lift off the ground a bit to slam one fist down, and detonate both with a small area of effect blast. This is a perfect attack to try retreating using the Thrust Stance and hitting him from a distance with a charged heavy attack while out of range of the blast.",
