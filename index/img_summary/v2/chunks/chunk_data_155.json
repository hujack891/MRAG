The scene shows the player character evading a powerful lightning storm attack, which is part of the boss's Shock-inflicting abilities. The preceding text highlights the importance of using evasive maneuvers like Cloud Step to avoid damage during these attacks, while the following text warns of the boss's increased aggression and lightning-infused close-combat moves in the second phase of the fight. The image visually reinforces the intensity of the encounter and the need for strategic dodging."
