The boss is shown unleashing a powerful blood spray attack, creating pools of blood and red energy effects in the environment. The player character is mid-action, wielding a staff while maneuvering to avoid the attack.\n\n2. **Narrative Role:**  \nThe image illustrates the described mechanics of the Gore-Eye Daoist's blood-based abilities, such as spraying blood in arcs or waves to control space and pressure the player. It visually complements the preceding and following text, which provides strategies for countering these attacks, emphasizing positioning, dodging, and using specific moves to mitigate the boss's poison-inflicting projectiles."
