    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy landscape with a brook running through it, likely part of the game \"Black Myth: Wukong\". The character Wukong is seen standing near the brook, which suggests the player is exploring this area. The preceding text mentions a secret cave near a cliff edge and a Melon Field Shrine, while the following text advises heading upstream to gather materials and watch out for Croaky enemies. Thus, the image serves as a visual guide to the exploration and discovery of hidden areas and resources in the game."
