The left panel highlights the traversal mechanics required to access the lower level, while the right panel showcases the challenge of defeating the Yaksha to claim the treasure chest containing valuable items like a Mind Core and materials. This provides visual context for the accompanying text's description of Level 2 exploration and rewards."
