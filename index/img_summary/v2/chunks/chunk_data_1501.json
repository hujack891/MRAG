    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the video game *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing the player character, armed with a staff, running along a rocky, volcanic path toward a massive, spiked rolling ball. The environment features dark, jagged terrain with glowing red cracks, suggesting heat or lava beneath the surface. This area is part of the \"Field of Fire\" section, where players must navigate past the rolling spiked ball to progress further in the chapter. The image serves as a visual reference for this hazardous segment of the walkthrough."
