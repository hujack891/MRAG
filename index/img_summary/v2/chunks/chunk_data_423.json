The scene highlights the eerie and disorienting atmosphere of the encounter, with the boss emitting a glowing, distorted appearance and the player's vision blurred, likely due to the boss's \"beguiling chant\" ability. This ability reduces the player's maximum health temporarily while providing a damage boost, as mentioned in the following text. The image emphasizes the challenging and surreal nature of the battle."
