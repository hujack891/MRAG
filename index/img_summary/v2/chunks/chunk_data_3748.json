    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" showing the protagonist engaged in combat with a small, agile enemy in a sandy, desolate environment. This enemy is likely one of the quick, darting foes mentioned in the preceding text, which are less powerful than the Civet Sergeants. The context suggests that this encounter is part of a larger narrative involving exploration and combat, leading up to a section with Withering Corpses and a hidden Ginsengling near a wooden chest containing valuable items."
