    "img_summary": "This image depicts the **Skandha of Form**, a key item from *Black Myth: Wukong*. It is part of the Skandha collection, which plays a significant narrative role in the game. The preceding and following context suggests that the Skandha of Form is one of several treasures hidden inside the Buddha's head, each with a secret yet to be revealed. Collecting all Skandha items, including this one, triggers a major boss fight and allows the creation of the **Skandhas Pill** from Xu Dog in Yellow Wind Ridge, tying into the game's progression and lore."
