The preceding text highlights the temporary nature of the boss's blade enchantment, suggesting an opportunity to counterattack once the electricity dissipates. The following text provides strategic advice, recommending the use of transformation spells like \"Red Tides\" to evade and burn the boss while exploiting openings for stagger attacks. The image visually reinforces the narrative of mastering the boss's attack patterns to achieve victory."
