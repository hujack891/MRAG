    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic combat scene set in a snowy, mountainous environment. A character wielding a glowing, fiery staff is engaged in battle with another airborne character who appears to be using a weapon imbued with golden energy. This visual aligns with the described second stage of the boss fight against Erlang in *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing his aggressive attacks, including weapon swaps and elemental abilities like lightning. The environment and action emphasize the intensity of the encounter and the need for strategic dodging and resistance to shock-based attacks."
