After a moment it will thrash around and try to damage you if close, but with an exposed unarmored part of its body, you can try freezing it in place and expending a charged attack - preferably with the Smash or Pillar Style to slam down on its ribs for extra damage.\nYou can also get an opportune strike after dodging its grab by using that moment to hit it hard with a Spirit attack from the Wandering Wight, and big enough hits can cause it to fall on its belly as well.",
    "img_below_text": "With enough damage dealt, the Earth Wolf will fall, revealing its Spirit to be claimed by you. You can look around the arena to harvest some Jade Lotus in the pond, or check the back of the houses to find other materials like Aged Ginseng.",

Generate a **short, clear, and informative English summary** of the image.\n        2. Focus primarily on the **preceding and following text** to infer the image's **purpose, content, or narrative role**.\n        3. Do **not** speculate beyond the visible content.",
    "img_summary": "The image depicts a battle scene from a video game where the player character is delivering a decisive attack on a downed \"Earth Wolf\" enemy. The creature is lying belly-up, exposing a vulnerable area for the player to exploit. The HUD elements indicate combat options and health bars, while the dialogue at the bottom suggests a narrative layer, possibly involving the Earth Wolf or another character. This moment aligns with the preceding text's strategy of targeting the unarmored belly for maximum damage and the following text's mention of defeating the Earth Wolf to claim its Spirit."
