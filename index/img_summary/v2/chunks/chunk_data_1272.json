The character is holding a staff, and the environment features carved statues in the background and a lit brazier. The text overlay suggests that the \"Man-in-Stone\" has deceived the protagonist, claiming the treasure and mocking their gullibility.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role:**  \nThe image illustrates the moment after the protagonist hands over the Stone Essence to the \"Man-in-Stone,\" who reveals his deceit and mocks the player. This sets the stage for a confrontation, implying that the protagonist must now face the consequences of their trust and prepare for a battle."
