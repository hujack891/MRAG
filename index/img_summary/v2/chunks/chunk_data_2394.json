This fire circle serves as a strategic advantage during the fight against the Macaque Chief, as the Chief cannot cross it. The preceding text explains how to use this fire circle to evade the Chief's attacks and heal, while the following text indicates that the Ancient Master will later teach the player the secret of the Ring of Fire Spell."
