    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" where the player character is in a dark, cave-like area filled with cocoons. The character is seen interacting with the environment, likely breaking a cocoon, as indicated by the \"Rice Cocoons\" item notification on the screen. This aligns with the preceding and following text, which describes the presence of various cocoons in the Webbed Hollow area, some of which contain enemies or valuable items like Rice Cocoons and Spine in the Sack Curios. The image serves to illustrate the gameplay mechanic of breaking cocoons to obtain items and potentially prevent enemies from emerging."
