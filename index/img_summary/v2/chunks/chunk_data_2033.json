    "img_summary": "The image depicts the protagonist, Wukong, holding the Old Rattle-Drum in a desolate, rocky area with sparse vegetation and a ruined structure nearby. This scene aligns with the walkthrough's description of the player encountering Weasel Captains near a ruined building overhang and later using the drum to summon the spirit of a boy who provides clues about a secret and a well.
