    "img_summary": "The image depicts a critical moment in the battle against the boss \"Captain Wise-Voice\" in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The glowing sphere-like core, surrounded by twisted roots, represents the boss's vulnerable state after sustaining significant damage. This follows the preceding phase where the boss uses a \"beguiling chant\" to blur the player's vision and reduce maximum health temporarily. The image aligns with the narrative progression where the player has successfully staggered the boss, exposing its core for further attacks."
