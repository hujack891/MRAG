    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scenic cliffside area in a dark, mountainous environment with a stormy sky and lightning in the distance. A red arrow highlights a specific path or location near the edge of the cliff, likely guiding the player to proceed in that direction after the battle with the Golden-Armored Rhino. This serves as a visual cue in the walkthrough to help players navigate to the next objective."
