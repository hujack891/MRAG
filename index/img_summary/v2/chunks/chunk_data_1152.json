A player character, armed with a staff, is engaged in combat with a large, tree-like beast partially engulfed in flames. The beast, resembling a wood-based creature, is shown in a vulnerable state, possibly immobilized or mid-attack.\n\n2. **Purpose and Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates a key moment in the fight against the wood beast, emphasizing the use of fire-based attacks (like Red Tides) to exploit the creature's vulnerability. It complements the preceding and following text, which provide strategic advice on maintaining positioning, using immobilization, and leveraging transformations to defeat the beast effectively."
