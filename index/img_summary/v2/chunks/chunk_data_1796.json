Despite the name, the Rat King of Flowing Sands is not your true target, and in reality you can complete this battle as soon as you defeat his son, the Second Rat Prince. However, if you choose to engage in regicide yourself, know that the prince will become enraged at the death of his father, and will gain a massive damage increase with empowered moves. But for all this risk, there is a reward — defeating the empowered Rat Prince will allow you to absorb his Spirit to use in attacks, which you **can’t gain otherwise**!\nWhen the battle begins, you’ll notice that the King wisely does not try to fight you up close. He’ll scurry behind his son and out of sight while the Second Rat Prince tries to hold your attention with massive swings from his spiked mace. The King can even burrow underground, creating a trail of flying dirt as he tries to evade you.",

The King of Flowing Sands, the prince's father, is present but avoids direct confrontation, opting to burrow underground and climb stone pillars to attack from a distance. The image illustrates the strategic dynamics of the fight, where the player must manage attacks from both the prince and the king, with the potential reward of absorbing the prince's Spirit if the empowered version is defeated."
