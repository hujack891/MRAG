As it takes a little while for him to recover, you can get your own combo of attacks in here.\nHe will sometimes leap in the air and try to land on you. Again, these can be dodged and ignored by stepping back. This is actually the case for most of his attacks, so bait him out to hit you and then take advantage of the slow recovery.

    "img_summary": "### Summary of the Image:\n\nThe image depicts a tense battle scene from the game *Black Myth: Wukong*, featuring a large, menacing creature mid-roar, surrounded by a faint shockwave effect. The player character, armed with a staff, is positioned in the foreground, seemingly preparing to evade or counterattack. The dark, eerie environment, with barren trees and ancient structures, underscores the high-stakes nature of the encounter. The preceding and following text suggests this moment highlights the creature's dangerous roar attack, which players must avoid by stepping back or jumping to escape its area of effect."
