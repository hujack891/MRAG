    "img_summary": "The image depicts a player character facing off against the Flint Vanguard in a rocky, desolate environment. The Vanguard, outlined in red, appears to be launching fireballs, consistent with its enraged attack phase described in the preceding text. The player is positioned at a safe distance, likely preparing to dodge or counterattack. This scene aligns with the guide's instructions to avoid fireballs, stay close to the Vanguard, and exploit its vulnerable state when knocked down."
