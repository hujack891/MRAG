Light pours through an opening in the cliff ahead, suggesting an exit or transition point. This setting aligns with the preceding text, which describes ascending to a cliff opening and passing through a tunnel. The image serves as a visual representation of the player's progression through the area, leading to a wide-open space where the Giant Shigandang encounter is imminent."
