A red arrow overlay indicates the direction the player should take, guiding them along the elevated path toward the next area. A character, likely the player, is visible in the foreground, holding a staff and facing the path ahead.\n\n2. **Inferred Purpose and Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as a visual guide to help players navigate through the Furnace Valley area in *Black Myth: Wukong*. It emphasizes the need to follow the path curving to the left, avoiding the lava below, and progressing deeper into the cave system. This aligns with the preceding text's warning about hidden enemies and the following text's description of entering a cave with ruins and lava."
