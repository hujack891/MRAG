A red arrow overlays the image, pointing toward a specific location in the forest, indicating a direction or path. In the foreground, a character is mid-air, seemingly using an ability to ascend or glide.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as a visual guide to help players navigate from the Keeper's Shrine to a specific destination, possibly the area near the second optional Poison Chief miniboss. The red arrow highlights the intended direction, while the character's airborne position suggests the use of vertical movement or flight mechanics to traverse the terrain."
