The player character, Wukong, is seen dodging the impact, while the health bars for the \"King of Flowing Sands\" and \"Second Rat Prince\" are visible, indicating an ongoing boss battle.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates a key strategy in the boss fight: luring the Second Rat Prince to destroy pillars, which causes the King of Flowing Sands to fall and become vulnerable. This highlights the tactical gameplay element of using the environment and enemy actions to gain an advantage in the fight."
