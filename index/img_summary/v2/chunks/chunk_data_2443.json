To get there, you will first have to defeat the Stone Vanguard at Rock Clash Platform. After you've bested the giant rocky beast, head through the archway on the side of the arena and activate the Rock Clash Platform Keeper's Shrine. Turn around so the Shrine is to your back and head down the path past the houses to find the Rat Governor.",

His main go-to attacks include summoning lightning strikes with his staff and using it to beat you around. The location is kind of difficult to traverse, so luring him up further to a flatter area could help if you're having trouble taking him down.",
