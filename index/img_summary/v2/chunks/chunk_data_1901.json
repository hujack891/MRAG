The glowing red claws and combat stance suggest the player is actively dodging or preparing to counter the boss's deadly combo attack, described in the preceding text as a relentless series of strikes following a roar. The dark, ominous atmosphere and the visible health bar emphasize the intensity of the encounter, while the following text hints at the boss's ability to perform a rare projectile attack after another roar."
