    "img_summary": "The image depicts the Ancient Master surrounded by a fiery circle, likely demonstrating the **Ring of Fire Spell** mentioned in the text. This spell creates a protective barrier that players can use strategically during the fight against the Macaque Chief. The fire serves both as a defensive tool and a way to manage combat, as the enemy cannot cross it. The scene is set in a snowy temple environment, emphasizing the contrast between fire and frost."
