The player character, Wukong, is shown approaching the massive snake skull, which serves as a significant environmental storytelling element tied to the tragic fate of the Snake General, who was tortured and killed by Yellowbrow. This area sets the stage for an upcoming encounter with the Yaoguai Chief, a miniboss resembling a larger version of the bats encountered earlier."
