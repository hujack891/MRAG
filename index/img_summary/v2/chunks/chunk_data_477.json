Now, finally, the shambling bodies will finally become a threat, and begin to glow as they chase you.\nThe good news is they don’t move all that fast, and must stop for a moment before finally exploding. All you need to do is lead them on a merry chase, and zigzag around to cause them to begin to explode before dashing away. Once no more glowing zombies are near you, resume your fight against Jinchi.",

All of the shambling bodies in the arena will be removed, but it’s when they start to reappear that you’ll need to be ready.\nIn this segment, the bodies will slowly walk toward Jinchi in the middle of the arena, appearing slowly at first, but soon swarming from all sides. If any of them reach a spot close to the center, they’ll be absorbed by Jinchi giving him part of his health bar back.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a critical moment in the battle against Elder Jinchi in a dark, atmospheric arena near an ancient temple. Elder Jinchi is shown hovering mid-air in a praying pose, glowing with energy, signaling the transition to the next phase of the fight. The player character stands ready with their weapon, surrounded by eerie scenery. This visual aligns with the narrative where Jinchi teleports to the center of the arena, removing shambling bodies temporarily, before they reappear to aid him by restoring his health if they reach the center."
