This spell is a control ability that binds enemies in place for a duration, with stronger foes potentially breaking free sooner. The description advises using it strategically when enemies are vulnerable, such as when exhausted, staggered, or downed. The skill tree progression suggests enhancements to the spell's effectiveness and duration, aligning with the game's mechanics for unlocking and improving abilities as players advance."
