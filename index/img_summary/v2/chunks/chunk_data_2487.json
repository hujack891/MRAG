It shows a headless man playing a Chinese lute (sanxian) in a desolate, dry landscape. In the foreground, a character, likely the Destined One, is seen lying on the ground, pierced by multiple arrows. This scene introduces the second chapter of the game, transitioning from the forests of Black Wind Mountain to the arid Yellow Wind Ridge, where the headless musician plays a crucial role in reviving the protagonist."
