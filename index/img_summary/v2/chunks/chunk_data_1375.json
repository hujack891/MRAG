A player character, armed with a staff, is advancing toward a Bull Soldier enemy in the distance. A red arrow highlights a specific point of interestâ€”a glowing green Wisp located under a curved section of the bridge ahead.\n\n2. **Purpose and Narrative Role**:  \nThe image visually supports the preceding text, which instructs the player to defeat the Bull Soldier and absorb the green Wisp hidden beneath the bridge. It serves as a guide to help players locate the Wisp and prepare for the encounter with the enemy."
