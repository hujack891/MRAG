The Mani Bead, when equipped, increases the player's critical hit chance in a Chilled State, making it particularly useful in icy areas, such as Chapter 3's The New West. The image highlights the item's role in enhancing gameplay strategy but also notes that Curios items cannot be upgraded, maintaining their initial power level throughout the game."
