The impact will be fierce, and even trying to use Rock Solid will simply send both of you stumbling back, so dodging is the better call here. It’s also a good idea to use Immobilize here, as there’s a good chance he’ll pull his sword out of the ground while performing a horizontal slash with incredible reach in a wide arc.",
