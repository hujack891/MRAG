    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" where the protagonist stands in front of a large statue, possibly at the Crouching Tiger Temple. To the right, a Boar character is resting against a wall, suggesting a moment of interaction. This scene follows a narrative where the Boar requests Jade Lotus and provides a cryptic message about the Realm of Gold. The protagonist is likely preparing to solve a riddle involving the Arhat Gold Piece, previously obtained from the First Prince of Flowing Sand, and must bring it to the correct location, which is hinted to be where the Boar Guai was first encountered. The image captures a pivotal moment of decision and action in the storyline."
