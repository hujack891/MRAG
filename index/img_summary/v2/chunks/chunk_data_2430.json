The Puppet Tick Spirit is a rare item with a high Qi cost that allows the player to summon Stone Spiders to attack enemies. When the spiders die, they release venom that poisons nearby foes. The equipped effect of the Puppet Tick Spirit significantly reduces the Mana cost for the spell \"A Pluck of Many.\" This item is useful in combat for dealing with multiple enemies simultaneously."
