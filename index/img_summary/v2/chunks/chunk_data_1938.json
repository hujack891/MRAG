    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat sequence from the game *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing the player character engaging in battle against \"Yellowbrow,\" a boss enemy. Yellowbrow is in his \"golden protection\" form, which makes him impervious to light attacks. The preceding and following text explain the strategy to break this form by using heavy attacks, potentially enhanced by Focus Points, to stagger and ultimately shatter his defense, leaving him vulnerable. The glowing golden effect in the image visually represents Yellowbrow's impervious state during the fight."
