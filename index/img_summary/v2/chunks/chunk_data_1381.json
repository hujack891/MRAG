At the center, there is a glowing flame and two notable objects circled in red: a pot emitting golden particles on the left and a small figure or item on the right. A character holding a staff stands in the foreground, seemingly preparing to interact with the scene.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates the moment after defeating the Flame Rhino Master and entering the small temple mentioned in the preceding text. The glowing pot likely represents the \"flame glowing inside\" the temple, while the circled objects correspond to the Awaken Wine Worm and the old man referenced in the following text. This scene sets the stage for an important interaction and item collection in the game."
