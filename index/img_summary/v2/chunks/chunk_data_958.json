    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic and ethereal moment in *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing Wukong and The Destined One kneeling face to face in a golden, misty atmosphere. This scene symbolizes the culmination of The Destined One absorbing Wukong's Six Senses and defeating him, as described in the preceding text. The imagery sets the tone for the transition to the next event, where the golden crown falls into the water, leading to The Destined One's fate of being trapped in the same rock as Wukong."
