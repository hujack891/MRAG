You'll also see The Supreme Inspector rise up from the ground, twirl around, and send out shockwaves in multiple directions. You can move from side to side to avoid these or dodge out of the way.\nAround the halfway mark the Supreme Inspector will switch up attacks and they'll become more aggressive.
