This spirit allows the player to take the form of the Elder Armourworm, enabling the use of the \"Foul Spray\" ability to create poisonous pools that inflict Poison Bane on enemies. The equipped effect slightly boosts Critical Hit Chance when the player is in a poisoned state.  \n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThe Elder Armourworm Spirit serves as a strategic tool for players to enhance poison-based combat tactics, offering both offensive capabilities and synergy with the poisoned state for increased critical damage."
