A prominent architectural structure resembling an ornate archway or shrine is visible in the distance, surrounded by jagged rock formations. The red arrow in the foreground indicates a path leading left, guiding the player toward the next objective.\n\n2. **Purpose and Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as a visual guide to direct players in the Furnace Valley walkthrough. Based on the preceding and following text, the arrow marks the path players should take after interacting with the Five Element Cart and exploring the area. It emphasizes turning left at a lava stream to continue the journey, looping back toward the starting point on a lower level before progressing further."
