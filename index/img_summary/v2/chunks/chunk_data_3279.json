    "img_summary": "The image depicts a player character engaged in combat with a large, tree-covered beast in a serene, forested water setting. The beast is partially on fire, suggesting the use of fire-based attacks, likely from the player's Red Tides transformation. The preceding text advises staying behind the beast to avoid direct attacks, while the following text highlights the effectiveness of fire attacks and heavy strikes to immobilize and damage the wood beast. The image serves to illustrate the gameplay strategy and environment for this particular fight in the game."
