    "img_summary": "The image depicts the protagonist, likely the Destined One, preparing for battle or recovering after an intense encounter in a snowy, desolate landscape. In the background, a large, ornate cymbal is visible, which plays a key role in the narrative as Kang-Jin Star, the antagonist, crashes into it during her dragon form's attempted escape. The scene symbolizes a pivotal moment in the conflict, where perseverance and strategic retaliation lead to freeing a prisoner trapped within the cymbal."
