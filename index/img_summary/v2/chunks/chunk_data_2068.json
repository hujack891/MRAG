    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat encounter from the video game *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing the player character facing off against a glowing, red-haired enemy, likely the Red-Haired Yaksha mentioned in the guide. The player is positioned in a dark, cavernous environment, with the enemy appearing mid-attack. The context suggests this is a challenging fight preceding a nearby Shrine, with strategic options like bypassing the enemy or using abilities like Immobilize or Cloud Step to avoid the risk of restarting the section."
