This scene corresponds to a challenging phase in the \"Foothills Walkthrough\" of *Black Myth: Wukong*, where players must navigate pools of blood and avoid blood-based projectiles while managing their positioning to avoid poisoning. The context suggests this is part of a boss fight, with Zhu Bajie assisting in later stages and strategies involving luring the creature onto ice or using the Wind Vessel to gain an advantage."
