The scene captures a moment of destruction as a pillar is shattered, likely due to the Second Prince's attack, which is part of a tactic to bring the King down from his elevated position. This action is crucial for the player's strategy to defeat the King, who is vulnerable when separated from his son. The image highlights the dynamic and tactical gameplay elements where environmental interactions play a key role in combat."
