    "img_summary": "The image depicts a tense moment in the battle against Elder Jinchi, where the player character is seen sprinting and attacking shambling bodies in the arena. The glowing green particles suggest the absorption of health from these bodies, aligning with the strategy described in the text: preventing the bodies from reaching Jinchi and restoring his health. Jinchi can be seen hovering in the background, emphasizing his elevated, unreachable state during this phase of the fight. The image visually reinforces the need for quick, efficient attacks and stamina management to succeed in this segment."
