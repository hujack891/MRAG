To combat Jiao-Loong of Waves, you'll want to use heavy attacks. It's not so steady on its feet, so you can easily knock it over or at least temporarily stun it. This will give you longer periods of time to give it a beatdown without interruption. If you use the Plantain Fan here, it'll be constantly knocked down on the floor, giving you even more time to attack.",

It visually represents the phase of the battle where the boss dives into the water after its health drops below half, becoming harder to track and attack. Players are advised to watch for rippling water to anticipate its emergence and prepare for counterattacks."
