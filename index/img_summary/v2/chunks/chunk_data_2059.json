A green Wisp, marked with a red circle, is highlighted as an interactable object atop a snow drift.\n\n2. **Purpose and Narrative Role:**  \nThis scene serves as a transitional exploration moment in the walkthrough, where players are advised to proceed cautiously due to hidden threats (Supporter Monks) and are encouraged to investigate the area further. The image highlights key points of interest, such as the Wolf Guardian and the green Wisp, which players can absorb for rewards or progression."
