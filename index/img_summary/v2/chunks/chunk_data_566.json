Just treat them as you would any other Sword Daoist, keeping in mind that their greatly expanded health pool should dissuade you from pressing your attack too long so that you can back off to evade their next moves and regain your stamina.",
    "img_below_text": "Somewhat surprisingly, Daoist Mi can also employ the move used by the Red-Haired Yaksha of Chapter 3, performing two quick fist strikes, and then turning around to perform a reverse bicycle kick that can hit especially hard -- but its still nothing as dangerous as the Scorpionlord.\nOnce you deplete their health bar, the Daoist Mi will invoke the power of the worm's egg, transforming into a Worm Practitioner for the second phase of this fight. Like before, much of their attack patterns will follow the basic enemy, so there won't be too much of a surprise in store.",
