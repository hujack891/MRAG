He is armed with a large thin blade and known for his unpredictable attack patterns, including frost and poison abilities. Players must strategize to bypass his defensive capabilities, which include blocking and parrying, effectively creating a secondary health bar. Preparing with Antimiasma and Body-Warming medicine is advised for dealing with his elemental attacks."
