    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, foreboding landscape with a massive, arch-like rock formation towering over a lone warrior figure, likely representing a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" This scene is associated with the Giant Shigandang, a secret boss in the game. The context suggests that players must collect four Skandhas across different chapters to reveal and likely confront this formidable entity in Chapter 6. The image serves to visually introduce or foreshadow the encounter with the Giant Shigandang, emphasizing the scale and challenge that awaits the player."
