Staying close to it will stop it from being able to hit you with the jet spray, but will make it more likely to try and tail-whip you.\nIt will also use projectiles and throw out orbs to chase you down. These can be dodged or outrun in a similar manner to that of the Keeper of the Flaming Mountain's attacks.",
    "img_below_text": "When you've knocked its health down to almost halfway, it will begin to move quite erratically and cover a large amount of distance across the arena. Use Cloudstep to catch up to it and sneakily attack and Immobilize to temporarily halt it from darting off.\nThis is also when it will begin to float up in the air and throw the projectiles down. You'll need to dodge in quick succession to avoid these.",

Emerging from reflective waters, the creature's menacing form aligns with its described attacks, such as jet sprays, tail whips, and projectile orbs. The serene yet ominous environment, with floating structures in the background, sets the stage for an intense battle where players must adapt to its erratic movements and aerial assaults as its health diminishes."
