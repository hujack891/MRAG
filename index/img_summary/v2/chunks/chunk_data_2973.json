It at least buys you some time to take down a chunk of his health without retaliation.\nIt's still worth focusing on heavy attacks and increasing your Critical Hit chances to finish the fight quickly in this second phase. If you stick with using Wukong's armor and staff, your Critical Hit chance will increase with Spells, so it's worth unleashing them in this second phase – particularly as they'll also receive a reduced cooldown buff.",

He'll split in two, with two health bars appearing on screen. When this happens, you'll now experience both fire and ice at the same time, with each monkey alternating between the two elements.\nThankfully, the attacks won't vary hugely here so you should be familiar with them at this stage. But you will need to keep shifting your attention between the two enemies as each one takes the lead.",
