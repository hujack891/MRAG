    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts an intense boss battle against the \"Macaque Chief\" in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The protagonist, glowing with energy, wields a staff while the Macaque Chief is airborne, seemingly preparing a powerful attack. The red-hued environment and the boss's health bar at the bottom emphasize the high-stakes nature of the encounter.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates a critical moment in the fight where the Macaque Chief transitions into a jumping attack phase. This complements the preceding and following text, which describe the boss's aerial moves, such as a jumping slash that creates a cyclone of blade slashes or launching projectiles. The image visually reinforces the player's need to anticipate and react to these dynamic and dangerous attacks."
