Watch her movement to see when she directs them so you'll know when to dodge their quick movement.\nThis boss doesn't move all that much, though she can teleport, meaning you'll be able to close the distance quite fast, but Kang-Jin Star will use a lot of spells to keep you at arms length.",

The problem is these rings will follow you for a moment before she enacts the strike, so again you'll need to watch when she crackles with light to know the strike is coming and dodge it. At the start of the fight you'll only have to dodge one, but over time she'll do more and more of these for the first part of her attack.\nShe'll often follow up these strikes by finishing her sentence with \"clashes form bolts\" and then toss a projectile straight at you from her hand, requiring a second dodge before can get close and retaliate.",
