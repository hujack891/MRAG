The enemy, a large creature, is using electric attacks and appears to be in a powerful state, causing significant damage and reducing the player's maximum stamina.\n\n2. The image serves to illustrate the intense combat phase described in the text, where the enemy no longer uses its sword but instead relies on electric fists and tail attacks. The golden dome signifies the heightened difficulty of this phase, emphasizing the need for the player to use the Weaver's Needle Vessel to free themselves from the enemy's grasp."
