    "img_summary": "The image depicts the equipment menu from a video game, specifically highlighting the \"Wandering Wight\" spirit. This spirit is categorized as Epic and has a high Qi cost. The \"Faithful Kowtow\" ability allows the player to take the form of Wandering Wight, performing a powerful attack that involves bowing and ramming the enemy with a bronze skull. The equipped effect of this spirit significantly increases the player's defense. The context suggests that this spirit can be acquired after defeating Wandering Wight and can be cultivated at a Keeper's Shrine if missed."
