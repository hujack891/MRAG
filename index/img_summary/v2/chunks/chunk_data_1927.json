    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" showcasing the Mother of Stone, a giant crystal-embedded statue that serves as a boss in the game. Despite its imposing presence, the Mother of Stone does not actively engage in combat but has significant health that players must deplete. The real challenge lies in surviving waves of attacking Palestones, stone monsters that emerge to defend the Mother of Stone. The image illustrates the endurance battle players face, emphasizing the strategic need to manage stamina and dodge attacks while gradually wearing down the boss's health."
