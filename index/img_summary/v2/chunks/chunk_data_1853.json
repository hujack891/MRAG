    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing the player character approaching a Thunder Rhino Master perched on a small wooden platform. The snowy environment includes a snowdrift and a traditional building in the background. The player appears to be preparing for an encounter, as the Thunder Rhino Master is positioned to potentially cast lightning. This moment aligns with the guide's suggestion to climb the snowdrift and engage the enemy before they attack."
