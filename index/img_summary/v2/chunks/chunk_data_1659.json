This wall is significant as it needs to be broken using a powerful attack to reveal a crack, allowing access to a hidden area where the Loong Scales can be found in a treasure chest. The narrative context suggests that this action is part of a quest following a mini-boss fight, and the outcome of the fight influences subsequent events in the pit nearby."
