    "img_summary": "The image depicts a serene, mystical village setting, likely the Zodiac Village within the Painted Realm, as described in the text. The area features traditional architecture, including a lantern-lit building and a decorative furnace or shrine emitting a warm glow. A humanoid figure, possibly one of the Zodiac Deities such as Shen Monkey, interacts with the furnace, suggesting activity or crafting. The environment is lush and atmospheric, with trees, scattered pots, and a campfire contributing to the tranquil yet magical ambiance. This location serves as the player's hub for upgrades, trading, and resource management."
