    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a dramatic moment in a snowy mountain setting, where a character is airborne, seemingly in the middle of a combat sequence. A large glowing weapon, possibly an axe, is seen flying through the air, emphasizing the intensity of the battle. The environment features steep cliffs, snow-covered rocks, and a waterfall, adding to the tension and grandeur of the scene.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image visually represents the second stage of the boss fight with Erlang, as described in the context. It highlights the moment when Erlang ascends into the air and summons a giant axe, which is part of his attack sequence. This serves to immerse the player in the setting and provide a visual cue for the upcoming mechanics, such as dodging the axe and preparing for follow-up attacks."
