    "img_summary": "The image depicts a boss fight in *Black Myth: Wukong* against \"The Duskveil.\" The boss is airborne, surrounded by glowing red projectiles, preparing to launch a concentrated burst of attacks at the player. The preceding text explains that these projectiles can be dodged or deflected using a staff spin, though deflection consumes stamina. The following text warns of an upcoming aerial attack and suggests interrupting the boss's move with a charged or Spirit Attack to cancel it. The scene emphasizes strategic combat and stamina management."
