If you miss hitting the horn, you can still attack it. Avoid hitting its face and instead focus on hitting it from behind. This will annoy it, and it will buck to try and kick you with its back legs.\nBut if you’re holding charge to build it up, wait until the Rhino is coming toward you or pauses for a moment, and then unleash the attack. One of the best times to hit is when it's moving slowly, with sparks appearing around its horn.",

When this happens, it will rear up and more lightning will start to strike the ground all around the field.
