    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a dark, icy cavern with a frozen archway highlighted by a red arrow, indicating a breakable path. Surrounding the area are jagged ice formations and glowing lava trails on the ground, suggesting recent fiery attacks. A character stands in the foreground, prepared for combat, hinting at an ongoing battle or strategic maneuver involving the environment.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates a key tactical moment in the fight against the Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast. The player can bait the beast into breaking the frozen archway to access a hidden area beyond it. This strategic use of the environment complements the preceding advice to dodge fiery attacks while building up Focus and stunning the beast. The visual serves as a guide for players to identify the breakable archway and plan their next move in the arena."
