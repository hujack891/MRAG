    "img_summary": "1. The image shows a battle scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" where the protagonist is engaged in combat with a large, frog-like creature named Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw. The protagonist is seen using a staff weapon and appears to be in a defensive stance against the creature's attack.\n\n2. The preceding text describes the creature's attack patterns, including a specific move where it waves its tongue-hand in a large arc and slams down, which can be countered using a defensive move called Rock Solid. The following text warns about a deceptive attack starting with the creature's left hand, advising players to dodge immediately to avoid being grabbed. The image serves to illustrate the intense combat and the need for strategic defense and evasion during the boss fight."
