The Commander Beetle is shown executing a powerful sword slam, creating a bright, fissure-like wave of force on the ground. This visual representation aligns with the preceding text describing the Commander Beetle's ability to perform multiple sword slams that result in large fissures, and the following text that mentions the beetle's capability to send slicing waves of force from a distance. The image serves to illustrate the intense combat mechanics and the specific attack patterns of the Commander Beetle."
