The environment is detailed with moss-covered rocks and trees, suggesting a natural, mystical setting.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates the moment where the player can interact with green wisps, which are described in the following text as wandering yaoguai spirits. These wisps provide a small amount of \"Will\" when gathered but are elusive and will scatter if approached directly. This scene highlights an exploration and resource-gathering mechanic within the game."
