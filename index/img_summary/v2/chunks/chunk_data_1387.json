    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a tense, atmospheric scene featuring two figures on a reflective, water-like surface. One figure, wielding a bow, appears to be kneeling or preparing to attack, while the other, armed with a club, stands at a distance. The background features ominous, towering structures and a cloudy sky, adding to the dramatic and foreboding tone.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image likely illustrates a pivotal moment in the battle against the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, as described in the preceding and following text. The kneeling figure may represent one of the summoned revenants (possibly the black archer revenant), while the distant figure could be the white revenant with the club. This visual emphasizes the need to prioritize eliminating the ranged revenants before focusing on the main boss. The stark environment underscores the high-stakes nature of the encounter."
