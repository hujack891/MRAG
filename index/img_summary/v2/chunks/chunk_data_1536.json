The red arrow highlights a specific path leading deeper into the cave, likely pointing toward an alternate route or hidden area. Based on the context, this path leads to a set of stairs that culminates in a boss encounter with the \"Mother of Stones.\" The image serves as a visual guide to help players locate the correct path for progressing toward the secret boss in *Black Myth: Wukong*."
