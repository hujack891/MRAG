    "img_summary": "The image depicts the character selection and equipment screen for the character \"Non-Void\" in a game. Non-Void is an epic spirit with the ability \"Flash Step,\" which allows the character to become intangible and invincible by turning into a waving after-image. The equipped effect of this ability recovers a moderate amount of stamina when the character is hit. The context suggests that Non-Void uses spells rather than weapons to deal damage and has unique abilities like invisibility and creating damaging vortexes."
