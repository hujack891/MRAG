    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a combat scene in a rocky, desert-like environment. A player character is engaged in battle with an enemy near a golden chest, which is positioned at the base of a large stone structure. In the background, another enemy (likely an archer) is perched on a ledge, suggesting a multi-level encounter.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates a key moment in the walkthrough where the player must clear out enemies, including archers, to safely access the chest. This chest contains valuable loot, including the **Blood of the Iron Bull** and gold pieces, which are crucial for progression. The scene emphasizes the tactical challenge of managing enemies while exploring and collecting rewards."
