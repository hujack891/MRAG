The player character is positioned on the snowy ground below, seemingly bracing for the incoming assault. The visual effects emphasize the intensity of the encounter, with lightning-like energy radiating outward.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThis image illustrates the boss's ability to hover and summon electrified spears, as described in the preceding text. It visually captures the buildup to her attack, showcasing the danger and the need for strategic movement (e.g., Cloud Step or dodging). It sets the stage for the following moment, where she summons a final giant spear to strike the player."
