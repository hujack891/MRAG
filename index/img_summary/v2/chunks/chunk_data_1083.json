This will just be a single shot each time, so it's easiest to dodge. It will also attempt to close the gap by flying over to you and smashing down.",

Run around when this occurs, to avoid as much of the fireballs as possible.\nGenerally, you want to stick close to the Vanguard, dodge the punches, and build up focus to perform heavy attacks. You can knock it over like this, where it will be on all fours, so you can target it while it's vulnerable.",
