The prompt on the screen indicates the player can \"Jump In\" by pressing the RT button. This scene is part of a questline in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" where the player is invited by a spirit to descend into the well. The context suggests that jumping into the well will lead to a secret area where the player will encounter a challenging boss known as the Mad Tiger."
