The Gall Gem provides a moderate increase in Poison Resistance for a short duration when used with the Gourd. The item description emphasizes its utility and includes a philosophical quote about self-cultivation.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves to illustrate the Gall Gem's role as an early-game Soak in *Black Myth: Wukong*. It complements the preceding text, which explains its function as a minor buff to Poison Resistance, and the following text, which notes that Soaks cannot be upgraded. This reinforces the item's importance in the player's strategy while exploring Black Wind Mountain."
