    "img_summary": "The image depicts a boss battle scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" featuring the boss Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw. The player character is engaged in combat within a dark, cavernous environment filled with poison. The boss, a large frog-like creature, is seen spewing poison, which necessitates the use of Antimiasma Pills to survive. The image also highlights various in-game items and abilities available to the player, such as Evil Repelling Medicament and Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets, which are crucial for navigating this challenging encounter. The context suggests that the boss has a unique attack phase involving a long hand disguised as a tongue, adding to the complexity of the fight."
