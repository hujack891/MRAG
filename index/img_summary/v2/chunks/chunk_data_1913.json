    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a desolate, eerie scene featuring a weathered stone well surrounded by skeletal remains in a dry, barren field. A character, likely the protagonist, stands at the edge of the well, holding a staff, with an on-screen prompt (\"RT - Jump In\") suggesting interaction with the well.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image sets the stage for a pivotal moment in the game, where the player is prompted to descend into the well after summoning the spirit of a boy using the Rattle-Drum. The surrounding skeletons and ominous atmosphere foreshadow an impending encounter with a dangerous entity, as hinted by the preceding and following text. This marks the transition to a significant event, likely the \"Mad Tiger Fight.\""
