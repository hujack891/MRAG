Two red arrows indicate possible paths forward, suggesting a branching route. A glowing red stream of lava is visible in the distance, descending from the ceiling, serving as a focal point for navigation.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates the next section of the Furnace Valley walkthrough, guiding players to proceed through one of the two paths highlighted by the arrows. It connects the preceding context of collecting items and defeating the Turtle Treasure Spirit with the following instructions to navigate toward the lava stream and engage with a hidden enemy (Flamling) and a collectible (Fire Date)."
