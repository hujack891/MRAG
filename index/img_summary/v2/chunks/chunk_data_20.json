    "img_summary": "The image showcases the \"Ashen Slumber\" transformation ability from *Black Myth: Wukong*. It allows the player to transform into a rat guai, attacking enemies with slashes and fiery blasts that inflict Scorch Bane. The ability has a high Might cost and requires focus buildup before transformation. This skill is part of the game's spell system, specifically under \"Transformations,\" and can be awakened for enhanced use."
