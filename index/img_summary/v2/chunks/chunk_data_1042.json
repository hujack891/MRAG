    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense battle scene from the video game *Black Myth: Wukong*. A large Rhino-like creature is shown mid-attack, launching rocks into the air as part of its projectile move described in the guide. The player character, positioned in the foreground, appears ready to dodge or counter the attack. The surrounding arena is littered with debris and fire, emphasizing the destructive nature of the fight. This visual aligns with the walkthrough's advice on avoiding the Rhino's rock-flicking attack and targeting its horn for damage."
