    "img_summary": "1. **Summary**:  \nThe image depicts a dramatic moment in a snowy, desolate landscape where a character is airborne, surrounded by streaks of light or energy, likely representing an intense attack or defensive maneuver. The backdrop features a towering, icy mountain and gnarled, barren trees, emphasizing the harsh and foreboding environment.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates a key phase of a boss fight, where the enemy unleashes a powerful aerial attack involving energy beams or projectiles. This corresponds to the preceding text describing the boss shooting a laser beam and summoning duplicates, and the following text warning of the escalating danger as the fight progresses. The visual reinforces the high stakes and intensity of the encounter."
