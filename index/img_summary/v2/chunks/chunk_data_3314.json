One of these changes includes the Great Sage's Broken Shell climbing to the top of his staff just like before, but this time, unleashing a flurry of projectiles. Tap dodge and roll to the side quickly to avoid this and build up focus while doing so. Then be prepared for him to slide down toward you, skim the water, and quickly dash back at you to try for another hit.\nHis combos will also become more aggressive and dangerous, and you'll see him jump up in the air and spin his staff multiple times. It will glow red as he smashes it down, and you'll need to dash out of the way to avoid it doing huge amounts of damage.",
    "img_below_text": "Lastly, you'll see him use the Somersault Cloud spell to zoom around the area, hit you, and dash off. He will try to grab you when using this, so it's important to learn the timings and roll away as often as possible.\nJust like the first phase, the key to this fight is attacking when you have your Focus Points built up and not trying to finish light combos. He'll typically interrupt them or use his perfect dodge to hurt you in the process, so it's best to wait until you can land those heavy attacks. It's also important to note him during his Rock Solid phase! Otherwise, you'll see the Destined One kicked around by the Great Sage's duplicates.",
