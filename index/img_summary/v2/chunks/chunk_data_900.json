    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image:**  \nThe image depicts a combat scenario from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing the \"Yellow-Robed Squire\" enemy executing a claw-based attack in a dusty battlefield. The enemy is mid-action, extending its clawed hand in a sweeping motion while the player character is on the ground, seemingly recovering or evading. The game's UI elements, including health bars and ability icons, are visible, emphasizing the intensity of the fight.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role:**  \nThis image visually complements the preceding and following text, illustrating one of the described attack patterns of the \"Yellow-Robed Squire.\" Specifically, it aligns with the mention of the enemy's claw-based combos, such as the \"pocket sand\" attack followed by swipes and a jump attack or the charged impaling thrust. The image serves to provide players with a visual reference for anticipating and reacting to the enemy's moves during combat."
