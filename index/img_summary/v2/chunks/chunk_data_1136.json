The boss is summoning rocks into the air, likely preparing to launch them at the player character, who is shown readying their weapon. This scene aligns with the preceding text, describing the boss's rock shockwave and projectile attacks, and the following text, which advises strategies to counter this phase, such as using heavy attacks or the Plantain Fan to disrupt the boss's actions."
