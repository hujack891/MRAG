    "img_summary": "The image shows the player character from *Black Myth: Wukong* standing in a snowy environment, facing a large staircase leading to a building surrounded by bamboo trees and stone structures. The character wields a glowing staff and wears a fur-like cloak. The HUD displays stamina, abilities, and \"Will\" currency (x67). This scene likely follows the acquisition of the **Fleeting Powder Formula** and precedes exploration of the bridge and balcony mentioned in the guide."
