    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts the crafting interface in *Black Myth: Wukong*, where players can create Celestial Pills, such as the Jade Lotus Pill. This specific pill moderately increases Maximum Health permanently. The interface shows the required resources (e.g., Will and Mind Core) and the resulting stat changes. The character, likely Wukong, is shown in the background in a dimly lit, cavernous environment.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves to illustrate how players can upgrade their character's stats (Health, Mana, and Stamina) using Celestial Pills, aligning with the preceding text's discussion of Xu Dog's role in stat upgrades. It complements the following text by setting the stage for exploration and resource collection, which is necessary for crafting these pills and progressing in the game."
