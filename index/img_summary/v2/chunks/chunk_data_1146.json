The environment is dark and foreboding, with red orbs of blood floating ominously in the air, hinting at incoming projectile attacks. The player character is visible in the foreground, preparing to face the creature. This phase introduces additional hazards, such as blood projectiles, and the narrative suggests Zhu Bajie will assist the player during this challenging encounter."
