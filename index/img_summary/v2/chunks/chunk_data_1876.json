The player character is positioned near a glowing circle of fire, which serves as a strategic element in the fight. The fire acts as a barrier that the Macaque Chief cannot cross, allowing the player to evade attacks or heal safely. The snowy environment and temple architecture in the background set the scene for this intense boss battle."
