He’ll pull into a rapid stab attack with the sword that moves very fast — but it is possible to evade it using the Pillar Stance by raising yourself above the stab and then retaliating with a charged hit.\nWhen he holds his sword back behind him, he’ll launch into two fast upward slashes, which usually ends with him taking the aforementioned stance before his thrust attack.",
    "img_below_text": "If he holds his sword back without moving, he’ll charge up for a combo attack consisting of two quick horizontal slashes, and then a short jump into the air to land with a downward slash attack. Retaliate cautiously if he doesn’t move away, and be ready for him to assume his next stance.\nHe can also charge at you with his sword behind his back in a sheathed stance, and then quickly slash forward with a follow up jab for a two-hit strike. The jabs are straight ahead, which you can dodge around to the side and punish.",
