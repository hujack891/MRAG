    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong\" where the protagonist, Wukong, is facing a large stone creature known as the Stone Vanguard. The context suggests that players can summon another powerful entity, the Shigandang, to assist in the battle against the Stone Vanguard if they have collected all six Buddha Eyeballs. The Shigandang is stronger and can perform a finishing move to defeat the Stone Vanguard, but will turn hostile towards the player afterward. The image visually represents the intense and strategic combat encounters players will experience in the game."
