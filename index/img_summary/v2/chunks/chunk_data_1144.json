The environment is dimly lit, with red-leaved trees in the background, adding to the dramatic and mystical atmosphere.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates a critical moment in the fight against the deer boss in the \"Foothills\" section of *Black Myth: Wukong*. It complements the preceding and following text, which provide strategies for dealing with the boss's tornado and frost shockwave attacks. The image likely serves to visually emphasize the scale of the creature and the challenging nature of the encounter."
