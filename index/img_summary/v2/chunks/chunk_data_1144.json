    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing the player character near a rocky area with a small fire illuminating the surroundings. A red arrow points toward a darkened structure on the left, suggesting the next path or area to explore. This moment likely follows the acquisition of the Buddha’s Eyeball and precedes a decision between two paths: a dark area to the left (indicated in the image) or a brighter path along the cliffs."
