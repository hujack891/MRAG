This scene follows the discovery of a **Celestial Nonary Pill** behind a tiger statue, which increases the player's maximum stamina, and precedes the path leading down to the temple where the first Swift Bat was encountered. The image serves to illustrate the transition from the room with the tiger statue to the canyon path towards the temple."
