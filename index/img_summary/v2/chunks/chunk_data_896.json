To the right, a boar-like character is seated, appearing to be in conversation or contemplation. The caption at the bottom reads, \"It's the right time now. I'm taking it to the right place to give it a try.\"\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThis image illustrates the moment after the player gives the Jade Lotus to the Boar, fulfilling his request. The Boar, now motivated, mentions the \"right time\" and hints at his next step in seeking the \"Realm of Gold.\" The setting reinforces the mystical and ancient atmosphere of the quest, with the statue and temple symbolizing the spiritual or historical significance of the location."
