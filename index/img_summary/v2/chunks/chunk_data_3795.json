    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic moment from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" showing the protagonist facing the Yellow Wind Sage amidst a sandstorm. The Yellow Wind Sage is seen wielding a spear, likely during the phase where he uses the Samahdi Winds to create a giant sandstorm. The protagonist appears to be using the Wind Tamer, an item that can negate the sandstorm and stun the Yellow Wind Sage, providing a strategic advantage. The image captures the intensity of the battle and the use of special abilities to counter the boss's powerful attacks."
