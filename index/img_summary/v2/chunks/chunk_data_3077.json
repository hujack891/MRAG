The setting is a large, open, snowy area with rocky cliffs. The player character is in a combat stance, and the enemy, Non-White, is standing in the distance with a glowing red chest. The text overlay indicates that the fight is about to begin, with the phrase \"The real show starts now!\" This image serves to illustrate the moment just before the second round of the Yaoguai Chief Miniboss fight against Non-White, as described in the accompanying walkthrough."
