Surrounded by flames, he is shown wielding his staff to create a ring of fire, which is part of his combat strategy. The preceding text advises players to use Body-Cooling Powder and Fireproof Mantle to mitigate fire damage, while the following text explains how to avoid the ring of fire and when to attack during the boss's recovery phase. The image serves to illustrate the intensity and danger of the Red Boy's fire-based attacks, providing visual context for the gameplay strategy described."
