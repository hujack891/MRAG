When equipped, it moderately reduces the stamina cost for jumps and jump attacks, enhancing mobility and combat efficiency.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThe spirit serves as a customizable gameplay element, offering both transformative abilities and passive effects to improve stamina management during movement and attacks. It is part of the game's system for upgrading and utilizing spirits for strategic advantages."
