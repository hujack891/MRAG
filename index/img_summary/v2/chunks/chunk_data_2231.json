    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player is engaged in a boss fight against a character named Non-White. The setting appears to be a frosty, cave-like environment, with ice spikes emerging from the ground, indicating an attack or special ability used by Non-White. The health bar at the bottom of the screen shows the name \"Non-White,\" suggesting that the player is currently battling this boss. The preceding text explains how the player encounters Non-White after resonating with four Buddha statues and entering a cave system, while the following text mentions that Non-White will flee once his health is reduced to halfway, only to be encountered again deeper in the cave. The image serves to illustrate the intense and challenging nature of the boss fight within this narrative context."
