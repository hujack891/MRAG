Since it's a ranged attack you won't be able to deflect this one, but you can dodge to the side while sprays straight ahead.\nWhen he crouches down while crossing his blades, he'll leap over for a low jump attack with both daggers, followed by two delayed swings of his poisoned weapons, and ending with a quick uppercut attack.",
