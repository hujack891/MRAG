    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing the protagonist holding a staff and standing near a glowing, crystalline object in a dimly lit cave. The environment features tall grass, stone statues, and a lit brazier in the background. The text overlay at the bottom reads, \"Ye are surely a gullible one! I’ve finally got me hands on the treasure!\" This suggests the moment occurs after the player hands over the Stone Essence, leading to a betrayal by the Man-in-Stone, setting up a confrontation."
