    "img_summary": "The image depicts the Emerald-Armed Mantis, a menacing boss character from *Black Myth: Wukong*. It showcases the mantis poised with its sharp, blade-like arms, emphasizing its aggressive stance and readiness for combat. The preceding text describes its initial attack pattern, involving slashing and spinning movements, while the following text hints at a significant shift in the fight when the mantis sharpens its blades and enhances them with a red liquid. This image likely represents the mantis during its initial phase of combat before the transformation occurs."
