    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a player character approaching a large, weathered wooden door set within a stone wall and traditional architectural structure, likely the entrance to a significant location in the game. The surrounding environment is barren and desolate, consistent with the Yellow Sand Ridge area described in the context. This door appears to be the trigger point for the upcoming miniboss fight against the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as a visual guide to help players locate the door that initiates the miniboss encounter. It ties into the preceding and following text by showing the specific location players must reach after navigating past enemies in the Sandgate Village area."
