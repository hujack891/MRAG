The fight is fairly straightforward in this first phase, but as soon as you've defeated the horse guai, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains drops the Yin-Yang Fish into the water.\nThe giant creature soon emerges and will begin attacking. It has a variety of moves that you'll see it perform during the fight. But the main thing is now you should make use of all your spells and transformations that you saved from the first round.",
    "img_below_text": "You'll see the Yin-Yang Fish rear itself up from the water and spray a jet at you, or flip itself up and over, to try and hit you with a tail flick. Staying close to it will stop it from being able to hit you with the jet spray, but will make it more likely to try and tail-whip you.\nIt will also use projectiles and throw out orbs to chase you down. These can be dodged or outrun in a similar manner to that of the Keeper of the Flaming Mountain's attacks.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic moment in the game where the Yin-Yang Fish, a giant aquatic creature, emerges from the water to attack the player. The scene is set against a misty, reflective water surface with an ornate structure in the background, emphasizing the mystical and intense atmosphere of the battle. The player character is shown in motion, splashing through the water, likely evading the creature's attacks. This visual aligns with the narrative context of the fight's second phase, where players must adapt to the creature's varied moves, including jet sprays, tail flicks, and projectile attacks."
