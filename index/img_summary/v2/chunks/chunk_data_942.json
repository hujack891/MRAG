    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic boss battle against Elder Jinchi in *Black Myth: Wukong*. Jinchi, a towering and grotesque figure, is shown mid-attack, surrounded by debris and energy effects, suggesting the use of his powerful shockwave or palm blast abilities. The player character is actively engaging him, wielding a staff, with visible health and ability indicators on the screen. The preceding and following text highlights Jinchi’s dangerous attacks, such as summoning wandering spirits to amplify his palm blast and creating shockwaves by slamming his fist into the ground. The image serves to visually emphasize the intensity and strategy required to counter Jinchi’s moves during this challenging encounter."
