It provides 17 Defense and has a unique effect: using the gourd temporarily increases attack, while not using it for a long time decreases attack. The mask is obtained by defeating the boar man in Fright Cliff - Rockrest Flat in Chapter 2, after giving him specific items. The armor can be further upgraded with Silk in Chapter 3. The image serves to illustrate the mask's attributes and its role in the game's progression and strategy."
