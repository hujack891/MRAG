    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character standing in a desolate, rocky area with sparse vegetation and skeletal remains scattered on the ground. The scene is part of the Yellow Sand Ridge area in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" The character appears to be exploring the surroundings near Sandgate Village, where significant events such as fighting the Earth Wolf and rescuing the Horse Guai occurred. The image sets the stage for the next part of the narrative, which involves locating a well near a statue altar and using the Rattle-Drum to summon the spirit of a boy who will guide the player to meet a \"friend\" down the well."
