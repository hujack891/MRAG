He'll now start to charge at you, sweeping down as close as possible to the ground, to hit you with his tusks. The best counter to this is a dodge, which will see him hit the ground and get his tusks stuck for a few seconds.",

These will turn into small tornados but they're extremely short-lived, so as long as you can dodge the initial gust, you should be able to quickly get out of the way of the tornado.",
