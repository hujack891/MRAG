Nearby, a figure (circled in red) lies by a rock, likely the Pale-Axe Stalwart mentioned in the context. The scene appears to be part of a sequence where the player interacts with the Stalwart after defeating the Rusty-Gold Cart, followed by breaking through the frozen entrance to progress further.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves to visually guide the player on the next steps in the game: locating the Pale-Axe Stalwart for a conversation and cutscene, then approaching the frozen entrance to break through and access the Chapter 5 secret area."
