These moves can also be evaded, to help build up your own focus for a counterattack. Again, you'll want to take advantage of Wukong's arm and staff in this fight, by using the fourth focus point for heavy attacks, and making use of the increased Critical Hit Chance.\nWhen the Great Sage uses his variation of Pluck of Many, you'll see a duplicate appear as close as possible to you and will swing its staff. This will disappear after attacking, so you won't have to face multiple duplicates all at once.",
    "img_below_text": "As mentioned, the Great Sage will use multiple stances, and you'll occasionally see him climb his staff to perform Pillar Stance. This is not to evade your attacks but is just a way to slam down on you from above. As you see the staff start to bend toward you, get ready to dash away.\nFinally, be mindful of where you stand in this fight. If you're too far from him, he'll throw out his staff as a spinning projectile, or swap to Thrust Stance to attack you. It's best to stick close to him but jump back when he performs perfect dodges or throws out Pluck of Many.",

This stance is part of his varied attack patterns and is not meant to evade but to deliver a heavy strike from above.
