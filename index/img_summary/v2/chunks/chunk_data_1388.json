    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a dark, ominous figure emerging from a reflective, watery surface in a desolate and surreal environment. The figure appears to be humanoid but distorted, suggesting a menacing presence. In the background, towering structures with hanging banners or ornaments rise into a cloudy, stormy sky, adding to the eerie and foreboding atmosphere.\n\n2. **Narrative Role**:  \nThis image likely represents the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, a key enemy in the described battle sequence. The preceding text emphasizes the strategy of defeating revenants before focusing on the Keeper, while the following text hints at the arrival of another foe, Ma Tianba, as the fight progresses. The image visually conveys the intensity and surreal nature of the confrontation, setting the tone for the climactic battle in the walkthrough."
