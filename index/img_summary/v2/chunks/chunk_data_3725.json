In the foreground, a character appears to be sneaking or preparing for an encounter. This scene likely illustrates the player's approach to a strategic point in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" where they must deal with melee attackers before crossing to confront a Blazebone and later encounter a mini-boss, the Yaoguai Chief's Acolyte, near a long bridge."
