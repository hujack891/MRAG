    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy scene outside a rustic building, where three characters are present: a humanoid monkey-like figure wielding a staff, a pig-like companion, and a crouching man wearing a straw hat. The text overlay at the bottom references a riddle about a treasure described as \"green without, round and sweet. Red within, a summer treat.\" This image aligns with the narrative where the man discusses his search for treasure and hints at its description, setting up a quest or puzzle for the player."
