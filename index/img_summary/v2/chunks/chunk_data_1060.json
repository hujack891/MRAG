    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the video game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" showing a player character facing a large, tree-covered beast in a body of water. The beast appears to be on fire, likely due to the player's use of the Red Tides transformation, which is effective against wood-based enemies. The context suggests strategies for fighting this beast, including staying behind it to avoid frontal attacks and using immobilization and fire-based attacks to gain an advantage."
