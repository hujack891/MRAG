The spirit's skill, \"Frost Blade,\" allows the player to leap into the air to evade attacks and unleash freezing gusts that deal Frost Damage, with the potential to freeze enemies if their Frost gauge is maxed. The interface highlights its high Qi cost and the option to equip or preview the ability.\n\n2. The image complements the preceding and following text by providing visual details about the Apramāṇa Bat's abilities and mechanics. It reinforces the strategic advice given earlier about immobilizing the bat and showcases its utility in combat, as well as its lack of passive effects when equipped."
