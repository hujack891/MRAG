These creatures are glowing with an intense orange-red hue, emphasizing their fire-based nature. The context suggests this is part of a boss encounter with the \"Mother of Flamlings,\" where the player must strategically eliminate the Flamlings while managing fire damage and preparing for the boss's reappearance. The image highlights the chaotic and dangerous environment of the battle."
