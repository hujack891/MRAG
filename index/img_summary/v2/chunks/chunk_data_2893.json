The image serves to illustrate the intense and strategic nature of the encounter, highlighting the various moves and countermeasures available to the player, such as deflecting attacks or using abilities like Rock Solid. The surrounding environment, with twisted trees and rocky terrain, adds to the ominous and challenging atmosphere of the battle."
