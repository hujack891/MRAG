    "img_summary": "The image depicts a pivotal moment in the boss fight against the mantis in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The mantis has undergone a transformation, sharpening its blades and dipping them into a liquid that turns them red, signifying a shift to a more aggressive and erratic attack phase. The dark, visceral environment emphasizes the intensity of the encounter, as players must adapt their strategy using tools like the Plantain Fan to immobilize the mantis and control its movements."
