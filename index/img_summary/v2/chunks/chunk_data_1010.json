Ignore the Scorching Flame enemy, as the ball will take care of this.\nAs the ball breaks through even further, run with it. You want it to be as far forward as it can go before you go up and to the gap on the left. Another Searing-Flame will appear here, and then you'll find a gap very close to you on the right, with yet another Searing-Flame.",

When you approach, a cutscene will begin where you'll see the golden spiked ball go flying off the end of the cliff.\nAfter the cutscene, ignore Pingping running off, and turn back to where you came from. Remember the wall of flames? Head back there. Now that the ball is gone, it's safe to explore the area slowly and you'll find the flames have also disappeared. A path has been revealed, which is the Cooling Slope, and the next place we'll explore.",

    "img_summary": "### Summary of the Image:\n\nThe image depicts a rocky, volcanic terrain with flames visible in the background, suggesting a hazardous environment. Two red arrows highlight key paths or points of interest: one leading to the left toward a gap and another pointing to the right, possibly indicating the location of a Searing-Flame enemy or an item. This scene aligns with the walkthrough's narrative, where the player must navigate through the fiery gauntlet, avoid enemies, and follow the golden spiked ball's progression. The image serves as a visual guide for players to identify the correct paths and areas to explore during this segment of the game."
