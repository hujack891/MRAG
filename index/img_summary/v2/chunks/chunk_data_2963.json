You might prefer other medicines depending on the build you're playing with, such as the Mirage or Life-Saving Pill.\nThe first thing to note is that the Stone Monkey, like other Stone enemies, is resistant to elemental attacks, so the best thing you can do here is have a build that focuses on high attack strength and increasing the chances of critical attacks. His resistance to these attacks should also influence the Transformation you take into the fight with you – we'd recommend Ebon Flow or Azure Dust, which can both deliver heavy blows.",
