    "img_below_text": "Since Chen Loong doesn't have a whole lot of health or armor, use everything in your arsenal to keep him staggered and unable to hit back whenever possible, and you can rush him down before the fight goes on too long and you start taking double damage too often.\nWhen he's defeated, Chen Loong will throw a bit of a tantrum, and you'll find he's not such a bad guy. He also seems to know Xu Dog, and claims only one of his celestial resurrection pills can ease his pains.",
