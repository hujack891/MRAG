The dragon has plunged its tail into the ground, causing several electrified, giant tails to sprout nearby, as indicated by the dialogue \"To the deepest trench I dive!\" This attack creates a dangerous area for the player, requiring them to quickly retreat to avoid a massive spinning strike. The snowy environment and traditional architecture in the background add to the atmospheric intensity of the encounter."
