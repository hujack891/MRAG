On-screen prompts display available attack options, \"Moon Dance\" (light attack) and \"Moon Chase\" (heavy attack), while the boss's health bar and dialogue (\"You! I asked you to guard the bells for your master. You failed!\") add narrative context.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, and Narrative Role**:  \nThe image highlights a pivotal moment in the boss fight against the Black Wind King, emphasizing the need for strategic use of attacks and spells. It connects the preceding text, which describes the boss's complex attack patterns, with the following text, which advises players on countering the boss's next assault using specific abilities like the Red Tides Spell. This scene serves as a visual representation of the game's challenging combat mechanics and narrative stakes."
