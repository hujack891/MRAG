    "img_summary": "The image depicts a boss fight against \"Captain Lotus-Vision\" in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The player character is shown mid-combat, wielding a staff and facing the boss, who is surrounded by a glowing purple aura and appears to be emerging from a portal-like structure. Two glowing rings are visible in the corners, likely tied to the laser mechanics described in the text. The preceding and following text detail strategies for evading floor lasers and corner ring attacks while preparing to strike the boss during its vulnerable moments."
