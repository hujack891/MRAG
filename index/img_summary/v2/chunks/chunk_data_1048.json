    "img_summary": "The image depicts Lang-Baw-Baw, a creature from *Black Myth: Wukong*, in its solidified, stone-like state. This form is characterized by its brown, hardened appearance, making it resistant to attacks, which bounce off and deal minimal damage. During this phase, the creature uses rocks to attack and can roar to stun and damage the player. The image serves to illustrate this defensive state and its associated mechanics in the game's walkthrough."
