The context suggests that this image illustrates the moment before engaging the Stone Vanguard, where players can summon another powerful entity, Shigandang, to assist in the battle if they have collected all six Buddha Eyeballs. The image emphasizes the game's strategic elements and the dramatic confrontation with formidable foes."
