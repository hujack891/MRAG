A Spear Daoist stands in the distance, blocking the way near a gated structure. The player character, partially visible in the foreground, wields a flaming weapon, suggesting an imminent confrontation. The setting features stone walls, wooden buildings, and autumnal vegetation, evoking a serene yet tense atmosphere.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThis image illustrates the moment before engaging the Spear Daoist guarding the path to a **Treasure Chest** and a green Wisp, as described in the preceding text. It visually reinforces the player's need to explore the right-hand path before progressing further in the area. The red arrow hints at the intended direction of movement, guiding the player toward the encounter."
