In particular, he can use a large leaping slam to cause a sizable explosion you’ll need to avoid with a well-timed dodge. He’ll often end this slam by dragging his weapons around to his sides, so try to evade backwards or get around to his back before retaliating.\nHe also has a variety of melee swings - sometimes swinging both weapons in slow arcs to slam in the ground one after the other before a third and final electrical slam. Other times he’ll alternate slamming the ground with each weapon while it’s imbued on either side of his body.",
    "img_below_text": "The Black Loong has a particularly devastating but slow combo where he’ll begin to swing a weapon in the air above his head and then swing it down in a sweeping electrical arc in front of him, before doing the same as his other weapon. Thankfully the movements are very slow and easy to dodge if you aren’t using up all your stamina when attacking. They do however send out currents in front of him, so don’t think that just backpedaling will be enough to stop you from getting hurt.\n![Wukong BlackLoong 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/21/Wukong_BlackLoong_8.jpg)",
