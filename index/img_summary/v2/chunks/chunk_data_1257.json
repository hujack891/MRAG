The player character stands on the platform, suggesting the need to backtrack to the crevice entrance below as part of the narrative progression.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThe image guides the player to descend from the wooden platform to explore the crevice below. This is part of the walkthrough where the player hears a voice calling out and encounters a new enemy variant, the Poisestone, under the bridge. It serves as a visual cue for the next step in the gameplay."
