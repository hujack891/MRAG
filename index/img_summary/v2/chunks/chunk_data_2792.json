    "img_above_text": "The Supreme Inspector is also able to turn its wings to solid gold and deflect your attacks. You can still do damage when this happens, but it'll be minimal. Bajie will explain to you that when this happens, it's best to wait until it spreads its wings again. Still, you should try to be as aggressive as you can while you have Bajie helping you in the first part of the fight. As always, try to reserve any Gourd usage while you have Bajie, as he'll often top up your health.\nBesides the projectiles and using its wings to attack, the Supreme Inspector also uses a sword. This is where the thunder attacks come from, and they can vary significantly.",
    "img_below_text": "In the first portion of the fight, the Supreme Inspector will perform a combo of melee attacks using the sword, often followed by a grab from its feet. Alternatively, he will fly close to the ground and quickly charge toward you. You'll also see The Supreme Inspector rise up from the ground, twirl around, and send out shockwaves in multiple directions. You can move from side to side to avoid these or dodge out of the way.\nAround the halfway mark the Supreme Inspector will switch up attacks and they'll become more aggressive. The combos will become longer, but you'll see the same moveset from the first section.",
