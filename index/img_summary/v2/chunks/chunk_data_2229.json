Since many of his attacks are low to the ground, it's not a bad idea to swap to the Pillar Stance during this phase to attack him from above, rather than continuing to rely on the Smash Stance to see through his attacks if he'll just feint away.\nThere's a good chance he'll revert back to his original weapon before the fight is done, so make sure to adapt your tactics accordingly, and use a Transformation Spell like Red Tides to keep up with his movements.",
