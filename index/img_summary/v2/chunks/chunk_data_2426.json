Head right and drop down the wooden platforms to reach the ground below. Instead of climbing the stairs to enter the village, turn right and head into a webbed corridor. Turn left at the illuminated spot in the corridor to find a secret entrance covered in cocoons. Destroy the cocoons to fight your way inside and find the Puppet Spider waiting for you there.",
