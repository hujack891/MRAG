    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts the Yellow Wind Sage, a humanoid rat-like figure with yellow fur, holding a staff and speaking to the player. He appears to be requesting the player's assistance in a critical task, as indicated by the caption: \"If you are willing, I ask you to seize its vessel at the right time.\"\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as a key narrative moment where the Yellow Wind Sage, a past incarnation of the character, enlists the player's help in defeating a powerful Yaoguai King, a scarab-like monster. The Sage cannot engage the creature directly due to its magic, so he offers to assist by forcing the monster to the surface while the player takes on the task of seizing the vessel that grants the creature its power. This sets the stage for the upcoming boss fight."
