    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene in *Black Myth: Wukong*, where The Destined One, armed with a staff-like weapon, faces off against multiple zombie-like enemies (Yoaguais) in a dark, rocky environment with scattered flames and pagoda structures. This moment aligns with Chapter 5's narrative, where Zhu Bajie and The Destined One confront Revenants and Yoaguais in the Woods of Ember."
