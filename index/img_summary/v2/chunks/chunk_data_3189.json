Once your attack gets bounced away, the Venom Daoist will emerge, sporting two swords and eight arms to tear you apart.\nIn reality, the Venom Daoist isn't the toughest opponent you've faced, but the low lighting will make it a little hard to see his attacks in his tangle of arms. Once you learn his positioning for his various attacks, you'll find plenty of opportunities to get in some of your own.",
