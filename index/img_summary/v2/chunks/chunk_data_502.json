Either use Immobilize immediately here if you're going for Spells or throw out Spellbinder.\nYou'll want to run about halfway across the field before you throw out the Plantain Fan, but if he goes to perform his attack, it's best to dodge this and then use the fan. Once you've knocked the first shield down, use Spellbinder and go in for the attack.",
    "img_below_text": "When the second stage begins, he'll fly up in the air and a giant axe will appear. This will swing and eventually crash down but can be dodged quite easily. The attack doesn't end here, however, as Erlang quickly follows up with his own attack to try and catch you off guard. This will send out a ripple that looks like ice, that you'll need to roll over or jump to avoid.\n![Mount Mei Walkthrough \\(6\\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%286%29.png)",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy, mountainous battlefield where a character is mid-air, seemingly engaged in combat with a flying opponent wielding a glowing weapon. This scene corresponds to the first stage of a boss fight described in the preceding text, where strategic use of abilities like the Plantain Fan and Spellbinder is recommended to weaken the boss's shield. The following text transitions to the second stage, where the boss takes to the air and introduces new attack patterns."
