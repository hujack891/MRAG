The character is armed with a staff and appears to be heading towards a glowing object marked with a red target indicator. This scene likely follows the encounter with the Purple Lingzhi and precedes the upcoming battle with Revenants and a Bull Guard near an altar with green Wisps. The image serves to illustrate the player's progression and the next objective in the walkthrough."
