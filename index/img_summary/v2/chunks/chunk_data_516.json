The creature is mid-action, kicking up sand as it moves aggressively in an arid desert environment. The player character appears to be dodging or repositioning, while the UI shows health bars and abilities.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates a critical moment in the fight against Fuban, emphasizing its powerful attacks and mobility. It visually complements the preceding text, which warns players about Fuban's devastating ramming attack, and the following text, which describes its burrowing and sand-swimming behavior as the fight progresses. This serves to guide players through the encounter and highlight key strategies for survival."
