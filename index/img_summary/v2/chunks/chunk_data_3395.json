If this wasn't bad enough, he'll summon two copies to charge just behind him on either side, making dodging extremely risky.\nThe only good news is that the copies don't seem to alter their path once they start the charge, but Zhu Bajie will, so you'll need to be careful about timing your dodges and not rolling into a path of a copy. Rock Solid will only move you backward, and won't be too much help if it traps you in front of him.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where the player character is engaged in a battle against Zhu Bajie, who is currently in a large rhino form charging at the player. The muddy terrain and the presence of clones on either side make dodging challenging. The preceding text explains the difficulty of avoiding Zhu Bajie's charges due to the clones, while the following text describes the next phase of the battle where Zhu Bajie transforms back into a fish and then into a glob of mud, providing an opportunity for the player to attack when he is dazed. The image serves to illustrate the intense and strategic nature of this boss fight."
