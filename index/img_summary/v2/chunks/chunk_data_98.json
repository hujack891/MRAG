The scene shows the player character engaging the boss in a toxic, dimly lit environment filled with green miasma. The boss, a grotesque creature, is performing an attack, with its long, glowing appendage (possibly the \"hand-tongue\" mentioned in the text) striking the player. The HUD displays consumables like \"Antimiasma Powder\" and abilities such as \"Rock Solid,\" emphasizing the need for strategic resource management to survive the hazardous arena.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates the challenging mechanics of the Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw boss fight, highlighting the toxic environment and the boss's unique attacks, such as the hand-tongue. It visually supports the preceding and following text, which describe the importance of using Antimiasma Pills to counteract the poison and prepare for the boss's surprising second-phase attacks."
