    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense combat moment in *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing the player character engaging the \"Yellow Wind Sage\" boss. The boss appears to be staggered or in a vulnerable state, surrounded by flames, likely as a result of a heavy attack. On-screen prompts highlight two attack options: \"Moon Dance\" (light attack) for building Focus and \"Moon Chase\" (heavy attack) for unleashing dashing strikes. This scene emphasizes the strategy of using charged heavy attacks to stagger the boss, as discussed in the accompanying text."
