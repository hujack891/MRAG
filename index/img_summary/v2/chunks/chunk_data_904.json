    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing the player character engaged in a duel against the \"Yellow-Robed Squire\" in a sandy, desolate environment. The glowing red sand effect suggests the enemy's use of sand-based attacks, as described in the preceding text. The player appears to be mid-action, possibly employing the Thrust Stance strategy mentioned in the following text to counter the enemy's moves and avoid the sand's blinding effects. This visual reinforces the tactical elements of the fight and the narrative progression leading to the enemy's eventual defeat and subsequent dialogue."
