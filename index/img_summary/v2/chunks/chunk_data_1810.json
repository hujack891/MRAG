This Drink offers a slight twist on the Coconut Wine allowing you to heal in a slightly different way.\nSpecifically, the Lambrew drink restores 20% of your health with each sip, but then also restores a further 25% of maximum health over time for a short period. This is a pretty solid tradeoff, when healing outside of combat, but the slow healing can be a big problem during fights and against some of the game's bosses. However, if you have mastered dodging and blocking, then this Drink may be more beneficial for you.",

Our guide has all of their locations for you.\nYou can then use these special Crafting Materials to upgrade the Drink at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove within Black Wind Mountain. Each upgrade will provide a sizeable buff to your healing potential, but as you level the Drink up, more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed.",

    "img_summary": "The image showcases the in-game inventory screen from *Black Myth: Wukong*, specifically highlighting the \"Lambrew\" drink item. Lambrew is a rare healing consumable that instantly restores 20% of maximum health and gradually recovers an additional 25% over time. It is particularly useful for healing outside of combat but may pose challenges during fights due to its slower healing effect. The item can be upgraded using Awoken Wine Worms at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove, enhancing its healing potency."
