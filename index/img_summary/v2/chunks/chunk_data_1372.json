    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a player character standing in front of the Rakshasa Palace Keeper's Shrine, with a dark, ominous doorway leading into the palace in the background. The shrine, illuminated by flames, is on the right, while two areas of interest are marked with red circlesâ€”likely indicating items or points of interaction. The setting is rocky and foreboding, consistent with the context of exploring the Rakshasa Palace.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as a visual guide to orient the player upon reaching the Keeper's Shrine. It highlights key areas to explore, including the shrine itself and the locations of potential loot or important items, such as the Celestial Taiyi Pill mentioned in the following text. This reinforces the player's progression through the Rakshasa Palace and their preparation for further exploration."
