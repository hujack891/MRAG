    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense combat scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, where the protagonist, wielding a flaming staff, engages in battle against a large, grotesque enemy in a desolate, temple-like environment. This moment likely corresponds to the narrative progression after obtaining the Arhat Gold Piece and encountering the Yellow-Robed Squire, who challenges the player to a duel.
