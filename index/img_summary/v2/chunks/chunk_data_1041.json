It's best to dodge all of this moveset, then attack.\nThough it's tempting to create distance, it's better to stay close to the Red Boy during this fight. Not only will this allow you to take advantage of those pauses we mentioned previously, but it also means he's less likely to use projectiles. If you're too far away, he'll shoot fire along the ground to try and reach you.",

These will launch themselves at you with their spears, resulting in an explosion. It'll start with one duplicate launching themselves at you, then two, and finally, a set of three will attack.\nThe best way to approach this is to stay locked on the Red Boy, but move as far back in the area as you can. If you need to, use any rocks nearby that haven't been destroyed. You can then dodge in any direction to evade the attacks and do a quick double tap of dodge when you have multiple duplicates coming at you. If you're finding it difficult to dodge the attacks, Cloudstep can help you direct some of the attention away from yourself.",

It captures the scene where the Red Boy creates multiple fiery duplicates of himself, suspended mid-air, preparing to launch explosive spear attacks. The glowing embers and chaotic environment emphasize the intensity of the encounter. This visual serves to illustrate the described strategy of staying locked onto the Red Boy while evading the duplicates' attacks by retreating and using the terrain for cover."
