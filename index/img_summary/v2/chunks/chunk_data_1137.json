The enemy appears to be in a crouched, defensive or preparatory state, possibly related to the \"rock attack phase\" described in the preceding text.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThe image visually represents the gameplay mechanics and strategy discussed in the surrounding text. It highlights the importance of dealing with the enemy's \"rock attack phase\" effectively, either by using heavy attacks or the Plantain Fan to disrupt its state and regain control of the fight. This serves as a guide for players navigating this specific encounter."
