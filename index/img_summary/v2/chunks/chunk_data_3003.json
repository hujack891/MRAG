    "img_summary": "The image depicts a player character standing at a fork in a rocky, forested path in a dimly lit environment. A red marker highlights a collectible item, likely a **Fire Bellflower**, on the left side of the path. An arrow indicates the recommended direction to proceed, guiding the player up the path to the right toward a distant structure. This scene aligns with the walkthrough instructions to bypass a nearby door and follow the upward path to progress toward the next objective."
