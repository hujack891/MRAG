The player character appears to be engaged in combat with a slow but durable enemy that uses large stones as weapons. The context suggests that these enemies can be countered effectively using a defensive technique called \"Rock Solid.\" The setting is part of a path leading to a cave, where players will later encounter new enemies, the Cyan Bats, as they progress."
