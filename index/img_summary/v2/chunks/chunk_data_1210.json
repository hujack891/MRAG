The player, armed with a staff, faces off against the Wight, which is a large, menacing creature accompanied by a smaller humanoid figure. The environment is dense with trees and mossy ruins, emphasizing the eerie and dangerous atmosphere.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image highlights the challenge posed by the Wandering Wight, described in the text as one of the toughest enemies in the chapter. It serves to visually reinforce the preceding warning about the difficulty of this optional mini-boss and the suggestion to return later when better prepared. The setting and combat stance also emphasize the strategic and atmospheric elements of the game."
