    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image showcases the crafting menu for Celestial Taiyi Pills in a game. The Taiyi Pill is described as a lesser celestial medicine that permanently increases Maximum Mana. Crafting requires 360 Will and 2 Mind Cores, with a limit of nine pills. The right side displays the player's current stats and the incremental change (+10 Maximum Mana) from crafting the pill. The setting appears to be a dimly lit area, likely near the Xu-Dog character mentioned in the context.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves to illustrate the crafting process for Celestial Taiyi Pills, which are created by the Xu-Dog in exchange for Mind Cores. It ties into the narrative of exploring the Crouching Tiger Temple Cellar and interacting with the Xu-Dog to enhance player stats through celestial medicines."
