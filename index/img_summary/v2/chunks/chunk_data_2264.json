His most common one starts with an uppercut punch, and then a downward strike after a short pause, and is then followed by a huge sweeping claw swipe that spins him around. If you want to try using Rock Solid, save it for the swipe so he doesn’t attack through his first two swings.\nAnnoyingly, he can also employ a similar strike with only the first two hits, but at a much more rapid pace.",
