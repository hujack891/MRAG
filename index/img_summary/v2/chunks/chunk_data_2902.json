    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" featuring a battle against the formidable enemy known as The Duskveil. The environment is shrouded in a red mist, which is likely the blood mist mentioned in the context, used by The Duskveil to obscure himself and complicate the player's ability to anticipate his attacks. The image serves to illustrate the challenging nature of this encounter, emphasizing the need for strategic retreat and careful maneuvering to avoid the enemy's unpredictable sword formations and attacks."
