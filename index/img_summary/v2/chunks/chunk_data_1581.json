They only hit a few times in different spots, and usually at a fair distance from the boss, so pursuing it and keeping close is often the way to go.\nMuch of this fight is about patience and waiting for the right time to strike back, as you don't want to waste time swinging wildly when there's no hope of reaching the boss. Let them come to you, and look for the right moments with stationary claw swipes or tail slams to deflect with Rock Solid for a better chance to stagger them.",
    "img_below_text": "Using the Pillar Stance is a great bet for this fight since you'll have both increased height and range on your strikes even if your lock-on isn't on the exact right spot that might cause your Thrust Stance to miss.
