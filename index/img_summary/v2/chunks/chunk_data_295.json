    "img_summary": "1. **Summary**: The image depicts an intense moment during the boss fight with the Black Wind King in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The boss is mid-attack, surrounded by swirling wind effects, indicating his aggressive phase after losing half his health. The player character is dodging the attack, emphasizing the need for quick reflexes and stamina management. The dialogue at the bottom hints at the boss's disdain for the protagonist, adding narrative tension.\n\n2. **Purpose/Role**: The image visually reinforces the preceding text's description of the Black Wind King's heightened aggression and wind-based attacks. It serves as a visual cue for players to anticipate and adapt to the boss's unpredictable movements and combos during this challenging phase of the fight."
