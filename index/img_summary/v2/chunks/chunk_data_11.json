    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a battle scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing the player character engaging in combat with the Apramana Bat, a large, golden-winged enemy. The bat appears to be in its defensive \"golden\" state, as described in the context, where it deflects attacks and prepares for a powerful counterattack. The snowy environment and combat interface emphasize the intensity and strategic nature of the fight.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThe image visually represents a critical moment in the gameplay where the Apramana Bat uses its golden deflection ability, requiring players to adapt their strategiesâ€”either by deflecting its counterattack or dodging and retaliating with a Spirit Attack. It highlights the importance of timing, awareness, and tactical decision-making during the encounter."
