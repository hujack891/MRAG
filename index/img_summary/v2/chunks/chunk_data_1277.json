    "img_summary": "This image depicts a dramatic scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing a large sandfall cascading down a rocky cliff. The sandfall serves as a magical barrier that can only be dispelled using the Loong Scales, obtained by cracking a wall near the First Prince of Flowing Sand. Beyond the barrier lies a secret boss fight against the Black Loong, a challenging encounter recommended for later in the game. The preceding context highlights a tough Spearbone enemy guarding this area, whose defeat grants the Spearbone Spirit transformation ability."
