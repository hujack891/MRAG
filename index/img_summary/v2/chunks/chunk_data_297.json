The glowing effects and energy trails emphasize the use of powerful spells or abilities, likely tied to the \"Red Tides Spell\" and transformation mechanics described in the preceding text.\n\n2. **Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates a critical moment in the battle against the Black Wind Yaoguai King, where Wukong uses advanced techniques like transformation and charged attacks to counter the enemy's teleportation and deliver massive hits. This sets the stage for the Yaoguai King's retreat and the subsequent acquisition of the **Cloud Step** spell, marking a turning point in the progression of the encounter."
