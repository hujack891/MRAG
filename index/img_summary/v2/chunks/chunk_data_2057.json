    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the New Thunderclap Temple in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" It shows the protagonist, Wukong, approaching a group of praying Censor Holders in a snowy courtyard. The context suggests that players can choose to either ignore these enemies or engage them for additional Will and Experience points. This decision-making aspect is part of the strategy in navigating the temple, where players can opt to bypass certain foes or confront them to gain resources and build Focus for more challenging encounters."
