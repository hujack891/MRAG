The Spirit allows players to transform into the Father of Stones, unleashing two powerful roars that damage and stagger nearby enemies. It has a high Qi cost and provides a passive effect that slightly increases critical hit chance and damage.\n\n2. The image serves to showcase the Spirit's abilities, equipped effects, and its role in enhancing the player's combat strategy. It aligns with the preceding and following text by emphasizing the Spirit's offensive power and its strategic utility in critical hit-focused builds."
