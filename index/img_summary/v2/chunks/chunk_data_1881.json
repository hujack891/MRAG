    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense battle scene against the Macaque Chief in a fiery, red-hued environment. The player's character is utilizing various combat abilities, including \"Fiery Burst,\" a self-detonation spell that deals area damage and triggers a transformation. The preceding and following text suggests this moment is part of a strategy to quickly eliminate the Macaque Chief's shadow clones, which replicate his moves, including poison attacks. The goal is to blitz the clones using powerful attacks and spells, such as \"Ashen Slumber,\" to regain focus on the main boss fight. The image visually reinforces the chaotic and high-stakes nature of this encounter."
