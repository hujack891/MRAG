    "img_summary": "The image displays a game interface focusing on the Puppet Spider Spirit, a rare entity with a moderate Qi cost. It highlights the spirit's \"Venom Claw\" ability, which allows players to take the form of the Puppet Spider and repeatedly attack foes with its fangs. The equipped effect of this spirit moderately slows the decay of Might, providing strategic advantages in combat. The interface suggests using the spirit's abilities by pressing 'F' and offers options to equip or watch a demo, emphasizing its role in enhancing gameplay through strategic spirit selection and management."
