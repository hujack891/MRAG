The bridge, made of twisted ropes, leads to a long hall surrounded by scaffolding and a large stone disc. This scene is part of an optional path in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" which offers a lucrative exploration opportunity and eventually loops back to the main area. Despite its appearance as an ambush spot, the path is safe and integral to the player's journey through the Lower Hollow."
