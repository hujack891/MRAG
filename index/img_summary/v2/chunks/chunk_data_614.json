    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene in a dimly lit cellar, where the Xu Dog character is kneeling and holding a glowing object, likely the \"Special-made Bone-Strengthening Pellet\" mentioned in the text. The protagonist, seen from behind, is observing the Xu Dog. The setting includes a large, ornate brazier emitting light and warmth, along with various pots and rustic decor, emphasizing the underground, temple-like atmosphere. The dialogue at the bottom suggests the Xu Dog is explaining or justifying someone's persistent ill temper."
