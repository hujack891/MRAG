    "img_summary": "The image depicts a gameplay scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing the player character facing \"Buddha's Right Hand,\" a large, grotesque hand-like enemy in a dimly lit, rocky arena. The preceding and following text describe the hand's attack patterns, including slamming and scraping movements, and suggest exploiting moments of immobility to counterattack. The image visually supports this narrative by showcasing the enemy's imposing presence and the confined environment of the encounter."
