    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, volcanic landscape with streams of glowing lava flowing through jagged rock formations. A lone armored figure, likely The Destined One, stands in the foreground, gazing toward a narrow, treacherous path marked by an arrow. The path leads upward toward a pagoda-like structure and a barren tree, suggesting progression toward the Fallen Furnace Crater, a significant location in the narrative. This setting foreshadows an impending confrontation with the Bull King and the revelation of Pingping's true identity as the Red Boy."
