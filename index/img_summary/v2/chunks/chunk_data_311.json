    "img_below_text": "There’s more than a few attack combos he can launch at close range, including two-hit swipes, which are sometimes followed by a raised foot slam afterward. Later in the fight, he can extend this combo with more slashes before finally slamming his foot down.\nHe can also simply belly flop down, requiring you to dodge to the side rather than backwards.This move can come from the front, as well as from the sides if he collapses on his side, meaning even if you aren’t attacking from the front you won’t automatically be safe.",
