    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat encounter in *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing the player character engaging a green, spear-wielding enemy in a rocky, forested area. This scene aligns with the preceding text, which advises players to defeat this foe first to access a winding path leading to a treasure chest containing the **Gold Sun Crow Curio**. The following text suggests progression from this area, including ambushing another archer and defeating a strong snake enemy to obtain the **Snake Herbalist Spirit**, before advancing toward the next main area. The image serves to illustrate the combat mechanics and environment of this specific gameplay segment."
