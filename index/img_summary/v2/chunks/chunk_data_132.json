This Spirit is associated with the \"Flames of Doom\" ability, which unleashes fire in a wide arc to damage groups of enemies or cover large areas. The Spirit also provides a burn resistance buff, making it effective against fire-based adversaries. The visual reinforces its role as a formidable and strategic asset in combat scenarios."
