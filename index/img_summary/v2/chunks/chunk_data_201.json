The on-screen text reads, \"Don't... Don't get any closer!\" suggesting a tense and dangerous encounter. The HUD indicates the player has collected a \"Tree Pearl.\"\n\n2. **Purpose/Context**: The image serves as a visual representation of the player's approach to a critical moment in the game, where they must confront three yaoguai (lesser Apramana Bats) threatening a man. It highlights the environmental setting, the looming danger, and the narrative progression toward a combat scenario."
