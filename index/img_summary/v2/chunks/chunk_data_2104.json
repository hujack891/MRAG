The preceding text suggests that Wukong is attempting to reach a Shrine at the top of the stairs, using abilities like Pluck of Many and Transformations to overcome challenges. The following text advises using the Ashen Slumber ability to strategically detonate and hit multiple enemies, while keeping one enemy between Wukong and another to manage attacks. The image illustrates the intense combat and strategic positioning required in this part of the game."
