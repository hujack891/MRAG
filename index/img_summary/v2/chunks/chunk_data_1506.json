    "img_summary": "The image shows a scene from a video game where the player is in a cave, facing a wall with numerous tiny statues carved into it. This wall is significant because it needs to be broken with a powerful attack to reveal a crack, which allows access to a hidden area containing the Loong Scales. The context suggests that this is part of a quest following a mini-boss fight, and the player's actions here are crucial for progressing in the game."
