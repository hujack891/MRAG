    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing the player character wielding a staff while approaching a gated area. Inside the cell, a Treasure Chest (highlighted with a red circle) is visible, along with a Red-Haired Yaksha enemy. This area is part of a side passage mentioned in the walkthrough, and the chest is likely guarded by the Yaksha. The setting features a dimly lit, eerie environment with red soil and scattered debris, emphasizing the game's atmospheric tone."
