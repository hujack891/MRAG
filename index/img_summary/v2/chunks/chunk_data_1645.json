The scene is set in a desolate, war-torn area with a staircase and a pagoda in the background. This moment aligns with the narrative context of defeating the Pale-Axe Stalwart, a key enemy in Chapter 5, who later becomes an NPC after being defeated. The image emphasizes the dramatic and challenging nature of the encounter."
