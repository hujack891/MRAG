He’ll often end this slam by dragging his weapons around to his sides, so try to evade backwards or get around to his back before retaliating.\nHe also has a variety of melee swings - sometimes swinging both weapons in slow arcs to slam in the ground one after the other before a third and final electrical slam. Other times he’ll alternate slamming the ground with each weapon while it’s imbued on either side of his body.",
