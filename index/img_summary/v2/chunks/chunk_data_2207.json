    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a video game where a character, likely the player, is facing an enemy named Non-Void. The enemy has created a swirling tornado of pages, which serves as a projectile attack. The context suggests that this attack can be dodged, but it will persistently follow the player, providing Non-Void an opportunity to launch additional attacks. The player can counter this by using a move called Staff Spin to disperse the tornado, allowing them to resume their offensive strategy. The image captures the intensity and dynamic nature of the battle, highlighting the strategic elements involved in countering Non-Void's attacks."
