A character, likely the protagonist, is seen from behind, wielding a staff and wearing a straw cloak, suggesting they are traversing the harsh environment to reach the temple. This scene visually represents the journey described in the text, where the player must navigate through the Valley of Ecstasy and the Path of Longevity to approach the New Thunderclap Temple, a key location in the quest to find Captain Kalpa-Wave."
