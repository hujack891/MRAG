The spider is partially burrowed into the ground, with its rear abdomen exposed, indicating it is about to unleash a deadly poison explosion. The preceding text advises players to avoid attacking the spider in this state and to prepare for the poison blast, while the following text explains how to mitigate the damage using the Pillar Stance. The image visually supports this gameplay strategy by illustrating the critical moment when the spider is preparing its poison attack."
