The player character is partially visible in the foreground, suggesting the next steps in the walkthrough.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as a visual guide in the walkthrough, pointing out two key elements: the treasure chest on the left, which contains valuable loot (Blood of the Iron Bull and gold pieces), and the path forward to the right, which leads to an encounter with a bull guard and further progression. It emphasizes exploration and preparation for an upcoming challenge."
