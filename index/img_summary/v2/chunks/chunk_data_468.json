    "img_summary": "1. **Summary**:  \nThe image depicts a player-controlled character, Wukong, ascending moss-covered stone steps in a dense bamboo forest toward an ancient shrine. The red arrow indicates the path leading to the shrine, which appears to be a key location in the game. The setting is atmospheric, with dim lighting and mist emphasizing the mysterious and ancient nature of the area.\n\n2. **Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as a visual guide to direct players toward an important shrine in the \"Forest of Wolves\" area. It connects to the preceding text, which describes the path leading to the first bell, and sets up the transition to the following text, which introduces the next area, the \"Bamboo Grove.\" The shrine likely plays a role in advancing the narrative or unlocking gameplay elements."
