The rest of the construct is highly resistant to damage, meaning you'll need to stun it so that you can take a shot at its most vulnerable part.\nOnly one of its legs is susceptible to attack, where you can see an orange glow emanating from its front right leg, so try to focus your attacks there whenever possible to try and stagger it.",
