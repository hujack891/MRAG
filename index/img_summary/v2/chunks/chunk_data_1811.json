This location is likely the hill mentioned in the preceding text, where the Lambrew can be found at the top. The rugged terrain and the shrine-like structure in the background align with the context of exploring Yellow Wind Ridge in Chapter 2. The image serves to visually guide players to the Lambrew's location."
