The UI elements suggest active combat mechanics.\n\n2. **Purpose/Content/Narrative Role**:  \nThe image visually represents the climactic encounter with the \"Mother of Stone,\" a unique miniboss that is more of a stationary, high-health obstacle than a traditional enemy. It reinforces the preceding text's description of the statue's crystal-embedded design and the following text's explanation of the unconventional boss mechanics."
