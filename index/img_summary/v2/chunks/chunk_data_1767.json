You need to pull the string and exhaust the dialogue from the horse guai Ma Tianba before you defeat him in this fight. Otherwise, you will miss out on the Dark Thunder Transformation Spell. Once you've beaten the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and the Yin-Yang Fish, return to the cart and pull the string to get the Transformation Spell.",

It has a variety of moves that you'll see it perform during the fight. But the main thing is now you should make use of all your spells and transformations that you saved from the first round.",
