Zhu Bajie is seen spinning his rake, creating a red, fiery tornado effect. This image illustrates the moment when Zhu Bajie is performing his spinning attack, which can be difficult to dodge but leaves him vulnerable once he becomes dizzy. The player is advised to take advantage of his stunned state by attacking from the sides to avoid his potential counterattack."
