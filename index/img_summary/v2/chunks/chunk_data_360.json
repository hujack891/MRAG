In the foreground, a large Buddha statue head with glowing eyes is partially buried, hinting at its significance as a \"Buddha's Eyeball\" location. This visual likely serves as a guide for players to identify and locate the fifth Buddha's Eyeball in the game, continuing the narrative progression from the fourth location mentioned in the preceding text."
