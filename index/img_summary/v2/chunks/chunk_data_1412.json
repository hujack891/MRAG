The item provides a situational benefit by recovering a small amount of stamina when performing perfect dodges. While useful in specific scenarios, it is less versatile compared to other Curios and cannot be upgraded, making it potentially less effective as players progress. The menu also displays other Curios items and character stats, emphasizing the importance of adapting equipment to match gameplay needs."
