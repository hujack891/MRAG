Since many of his attacks are low to the ground, it's not a bad idea to swap to the Pillar Stance during this phase to attack him from above, rather than continuing to rely on the Smash Stance to see through his attacks if he'll just feint away.\nThere's a good chance he'll revert back to his original weapon before the fight is done, so make sure to adapt your tactics accordingly, and use a Transformation Spell like Red Tides to keep up with his movements.",

The character is facing a glowing orb and a marked spot on the ground, which might indicate an objective or a point of interest.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role:**\n   The image likely illustrates a critical moment in the battle against Non-White, a challenging opponent in the game. The glowing orb and marked spot may represent key elements or objectives the player needs to interact with or defeat. This scene is part of the strategy to defeat Non-White, as described in the preceding text, and leads up to the moment where the player can claim the Non-White Spirit and use the nearby Meditation Spot for a reward."
