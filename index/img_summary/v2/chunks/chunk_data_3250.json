    "img_summary": "The image depicts a tense boss fight against the Violet Spider in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The spider is shown mid-attack, releasing multiple webbing strands from its back that arc across the air toward the player. These strands are part of the spider's insidious projectile-based moves designed to slow and damage the player, culminating in a large wave of projectiles. The preceding and following text highlights strategies to counter this attack, such as deflecting the projectiles with the staff and timing heavy strikes to punish the spider as it retreats after deflection. The image visually emphasizes the challenge and mechanics of this encounter."
