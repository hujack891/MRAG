    "img_summary": "The image depicts a player character engaging in combat with the Wandering Wight, a large, imposing secret boss in a forested area surrounded by ancient ruins. This encounter is part of an early-game skill check in the context of obtaining the Cat Eye Beads in *Black Wind Mountain*. Defeating the Wandering Wight is crucial before progressing to ring the three bells and killing Elder Jinchi, as failure to do so will make the Beads unobtainable. The preceding and following text emphasize the importance of timing and strategy in this sequence, as well as providing guidance for exploration and item collection in the game."
