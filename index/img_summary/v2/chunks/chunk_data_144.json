    "img_summary": "The image depicts a colossal turtle with a mountainous shell rising from the sea, emphasizing its immense scale and presence. This scene aligns with the narrative where the trapped \"Admiral\" uses a cymbal to awaken the turtle, revealing that the mountaintop the player is standing on is part of the creature itself. The turtle's awakening marks the transition to the Bitter Seal region and sets the stage for an impending boss fight with the woman who opposes freeing the Admiral."
