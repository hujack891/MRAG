    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character standing in a dimly lit tomb-like environment, facing a mural on the wall. The setting includes a chest nearby, illuminated by soft light filtering through the cave ceiling. This scene likely represents the moment after the player breaks through the cracked wall in the boss arena, entering the hidden tomb to discover the Loong Scale, a key item for unlocking secret bosses. The mural and chest emphasize the significance of this hidden area in the narrative."
