    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts the protagonist, Wukong, approaching a Sword Daoist in a serene, overgrown village setting. The Daoist appears non-hostile, standing near a traditional building, with a glowing marker (possibly indicating an interactable object or area) visible in the background. The caption at the bottom reads, \"It's been long since any soul has trodden these hidden bounds,\" adding to the mysterious and reflective atmosphere.\n\n2. **Purpose/Content/Narrative Role**:  \nThis image highlights a key moment in the walkthrough where Wukong encounters a unique, non-hostile Sword Daoist. The Daoist plays a significant narrative role, requesting the player to retrieve an Amourworm egg. This sets up the next objective, which involves defeating Daoist enemies in the village to find the required item. The glowing marker may indicate the Daoist's location or an area of interest related to the quest."
