    "img_summary": "The image depicts a battle scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing the player character engaging in combat with \"The Duskveil,\" a large skeletal creature. The creature appears to be temporarily incapacitated, lying on the ground, which aligns with the preceding text describing its stumbling after a series of charge attacks. The following text hints at a second phase of the fight, suggesting this moment is part of the first phase where players can deal significant damage before the encounter escalates."
