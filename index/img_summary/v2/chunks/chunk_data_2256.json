    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong\" where the protagonist, Wukong, is seen holding a rattle-drum in a desolate, rocky area with sparse vegetation. This setting is part of the \"Old Rattle-Drum Questline.\" The preceding text describes an encounter with Weasel Captains in a ruined building, while the following text mentions a roof-like walkway with Withering Corpses and a Ginsengling. The image likely illustrates the moment Wukong uses the rattle-drum to summon the spirit of a boy, who provides a clue about a secret and a well, advancing the quest narrative."
