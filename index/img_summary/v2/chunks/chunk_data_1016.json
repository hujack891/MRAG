Run around when this occurs, to avoid as much of the fireballs as possible.\nGenerally, you want to stick close to the Vanguard, dodge the punches, and build up focus to perform heavy attacks. You can knock it over like this, where it will be on all fours, so you can target it while it's vulnerable.",
