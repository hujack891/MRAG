The creature appears to be preparing to spew poison, as described in the preceding text. The player must quickly decide whether to dash under the creature or climb onto a pillar to avoid the poison. The following text suggests that the player will need to aim for the creature's face once it starts moving and slamming its hand down. The image serves to illustrate the tense and strategic moment in the gameplay where the player must evade the creature's poison attack and prepare for the next phase of the battle."
