The character is seen performing a midair maneuver, likely a heavy attack, to boost themselves towards the archer. This action is part of a strategy to quickly eliminate the archer, who does not respawn, and avoid falling off the narrow ledge or being attacked by other enemies, such as the Cyan Bat."
