A character, likely the player, is seen flying over the water on a cloud-like platform, heading toward the rock. This area appears to be the setup for an encounter with a miniboss, identified as one of the Poison Chiefs.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves to visually guide the player toward the next objective in the \"Foothills\" area of *Black Myth: Wukong*. It highlights the location of the Poison Chief miniboss, which is disguised as a rock, and sets the stage for the upcoming battle."
