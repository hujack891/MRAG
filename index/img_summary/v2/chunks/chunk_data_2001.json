    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense combat scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing the player character battling the boss \"Non-White\" in a snowy, mountainous environment. Non-White is wielding poison blades, indicated by the green aura, and is in the midst of an attack. The HUD displays available player moves, such as \"Moon Dance\" and \"Moon Chase,\" alongside the boss's health bar. This moment aligns with the guide's description of Non-White's temporary phase using poison-based attacks after switching from his frost blade."
