    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense combat moment between the protagonist and Captain Wise-Voice, a formidable boss in the game *Black Myth: Wukong*. The protagonist is shown delivering a powerful, close-range attack with a glowing staff, likely targeting the boss's weak point to stagger or defeat it. This scene aligns with the preceding text's strategy of exploiting the boss's vulnerabilities through sustained damage and precise strikes. The image visually emphasizes the climactic nature of the battle, which, as the following text suggests, leads to the liberation of the Pagoda Realm from the boss's influence."
