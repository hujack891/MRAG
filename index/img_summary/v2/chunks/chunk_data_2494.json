    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" showing the protagonist overlooking a flooded pit with a large Toad Yaoguai and several Rat Soldiers. This visual follows the encounter with the Rat Governor and suggests the player should return to the initial area to find a path leading into the hills. The subsequent text indicates the player should continue along wooden scaffolding above a ravine to reach a settlement and encounter another Rat Soldier guarding the Keeper’s Shrine. The image serves to illustrate the challenging terrain and enemies the player will face in this segment of the game."
