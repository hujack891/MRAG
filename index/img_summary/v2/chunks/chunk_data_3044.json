You can attack him while he regains his composure when he's inside it.\nTo follow this, he'll put his sword away, then jump at you and slam the ball down. He'll then drag it around him. Both of these attacks can be avoided by keeping your distance. Attack when he's getting himself back together, and chip away at his health steadily.",
