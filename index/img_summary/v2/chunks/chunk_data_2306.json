The context suggests that this pit is located near the Upper Pagoda Shrine, and below it lies a chamber with an optional but important Yaoguai Chief. Defeating this boss is crucial for unlocking purple seals throughout the realm, although the player must contend with a health-sapping curse until the area's Yaoguai King is defeated."
