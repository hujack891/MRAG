If you see his black wind fly up, be ready for the attack and either dodge past him or Cloud Step away and retaliate as he struggles to rise.\nWhen he comes at you in his bear form, all of his attacks will now deal fire damage, and all of his slams will cause explosions in front of him when his attacks hit the ground. Dodging is now more important than ever, especially to the side of his attacks to escape their explosion range.",
    "img_below_text": "Remember that you can also quickly evade his explosive slams by using the Cloud Step to teleport a short distance away, then race back into him for a Revealing Strike to deal a good amount of damage. Combo these with well-timed Immobilize to disrupt his combo attacks, and you can often knock him off balance with sustained heavy hits.\nEven with his fire damage buff, he’s not exactly immune to taking fire damage himself. If you’re in danger of being engulfed in flames and don’t have any more cooling powder, you can also use the Red Waves spell to transform, resetting your fire meter and building might to hit him with pogo jumps after dodging his attacks.",
