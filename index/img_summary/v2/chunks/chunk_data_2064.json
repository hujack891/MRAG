    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy battlefield where the player character, likely Wukong, faces off against a Yaoguai named \"Monk from the Sea.\" The Yaoguai is airborne, seemingly mid-attack, with frost effects surrounding it, emphasizing its ability to invoke frost damage. The preceding text highlights the enemy's ranged attacks with boulders, while the following text warns of the frost coating ability that raises the player's frost meter and makes the environment more hazardous. The image serves to illustrate the challenging mechanics and environmental dangers of this boss encounter in the snowy setting."
