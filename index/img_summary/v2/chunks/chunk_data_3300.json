The ground will start to pulse and he'll pull his first up, causing a shockwave of rocks to go upward.\nTwo other attacks happen less frequently, but go on for longer and can be more dangerous. The first one is that now and then, he'll flash gold and your attacks will repel.",
    "img_below_text": "He'll freeze at this moment, and it can seem like a time to strike, but he's actually preparing to grab you. If he's able to, a small cutscene plays where you're thrown and slammed on the ground either side of him. The second attack is when he goes berserk and starts slamming his fists down on the ground around him more violently and quicker than his usual attack.\nYour aim during this portion of the fight should be to dodge attacks while building focus, and max out the four Focus Points as soon as possible. With Wukong's armor and staff, these won't deplete, so you can land impressive heavy attacks with the staff.",
