    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts the player character standing before a large, intricately carved stone structure with a humanoid statue at its base. The player is prompted to \"Examine\" the statue, suggesting an interactive element. The surrounding environment is rocky and sunlit, emphasizing the ancient and mystical setting. A notification on the right indicates that a \"New Yaoguai King Anecdote\" has been recorded, hinting at lore progression.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image likely represents a key moment following the defeat of the Tiger Vanguard, where the player interacts with the statue to progress the story. This interaction may unlock lore (as indicated by the \"Yaoguai King Anecdote\") or provide access to a secret path or item, such as the \"Keeness of Tiger,\" which is essential for advancing toward the chapter's final boss."
