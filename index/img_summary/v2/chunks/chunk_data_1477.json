The environment is a rocky, cavernous area with fiery effects dominating the foreground. Three fiery clones of the boss are visible, each wielding chakram-like weapons, suggesting an attack pattern where multiple projectiles are launched simultaneously. The glowing red trail on the ground hints at the danger zones created by the boss's attacks, aligning with the preceding and following text that describe the spinning chakrams and the clone mechanic as key elements of the fight."
