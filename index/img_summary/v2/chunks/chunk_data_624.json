This ball is a central element of the fight, as it rolls aggressively around the room, requiring the player to dodge its attacks and explosions. The preceding text discusses strategies to weaken the enemies before they merge, while the following text outlines the ballâ€™s attack patterns and the need for precise dodging to survive the encounter."
