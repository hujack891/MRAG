    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a character, likely the protagonist, running through a lush, forested area toward a dark tunnel entrance illuminated by a faint light. A red arrow overlays the image, pointing toward the tunnel, indicating it as the next destination or point of interest. The setting features dense greenery, moss-covered rocks, and a small stone lantern, emphasizing the natural and mystical atmosphere.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as a visual guide to direct players toward the tunnel beyond the Wandering Wight mini-boss. It highlights the option to bypass the mini-boss for now and explore the tunnel, which is part of the progression path in Chapter 1. The red arrow reinforces the narrative context, helping players identify the intended route in the walkthrough."
