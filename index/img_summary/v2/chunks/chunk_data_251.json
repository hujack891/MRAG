To make matters worse, several parts of the arena are on fire and will absolutely start burning you if you roll into them for too long.",
    "img_below_text": "To make matters worse, Black Bear Guai can and will utilize his black wind magic to teleport around the arena, and pop out of thin air in the middle of a two-hit charge attack you’ll need to evade with little warning.\nEven without the wind form, it can be hard to tell which moves the black bear is using when you’re right underneath him, so be sure not to get too far into your attacks that you can’t tell when he’s preparing a new attack.",
