    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, where the protagonist, wielding a staff, approaches a shadowy forest path leading to a small archway. The area is illuminated by soft light filtering through the trees, with stone markers and a lit brazier nearby. The HUD indicates the collection of \"Will x23,\" suggesting resource gathering or preparation for an upcoming challenge.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as a transitional moment in the walkthrough, guiding players toward a key area beyond the archway. It highlights resource collection (\"Will\") and sets the tone for an imminent encounter, possibly the optional Yaoguai Chief mini-boss mentioned in the following text. The serene yet foreboding environment reinforces the exploration and combat themes of the game."
