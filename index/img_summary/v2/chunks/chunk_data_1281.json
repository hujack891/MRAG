The scene appears to be part of a quest or exploration sequence in *Black Myth: Wukong*, where the player is navigating towards a significant location tied to the Sixth Buddha’s Eyeball and the final statue head.\n\n2. **Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates the journey back to the Shrine at Rockrest Flat, where the player is directed to find a path leading to the final statue head. This discovery is crucial to completing the quest, as obtaining the statue's eyes triggers the mantra “Om Mani Padme Hum,” confirming the completion of the objective."
