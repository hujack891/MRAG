The treasure hunter is sitting within the ring of fire, and the snowy environment with ancient structures in the background highlights the harsh conditions. This action allows the treasure hunter to share a story about a hidden Melon Garden and a chubby boy jumping from a cliff, leading to a new quest location. The image serves to illustrate the moment of casting the spell and the interaction that follows."
