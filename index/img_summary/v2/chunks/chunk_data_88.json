Baw-Li-Guh-Lang can be found after reaching the Snake Trail Keeper's Shrine on Black Wind Mountain. Once you're there, run up the stairs on the right and take a left. You will come across a flimsy fence on the edge of a cliff on the left. Smash the fence and drop into the river below. Run to the right to find Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang.",

There are six frog bosses in Black Myth: Wukong, and each one yields a Tadpole when defeated.",
