He will try to grab you when using this, so it's important to learn the timings and roll away as often as possible.\nJust like the first phase, the key to this fight is attacking when you have your Focus Points built up and not trying to finish light combos. He'll typically interrupt them or use his perfect dodge to hurt you in the process, so it's best to wait until you can land those heavy attacks. It's also important to note him during his Rock Solid phase! Otherwise, you'll see the Destined One kicked around by the Great Sage's duplicates.",

The Great Sage will stumble in the water and the relics will leave his body as golden orbs.",
