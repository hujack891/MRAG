Key points of interest are highlighted: a Luoija Fragrant Vine encircled on the left and a cluster of rocks on the right marked with an arrow. The environment is barren, with lava flows and a leaning pagoda-like structure in the background, emphasizing the hazardous nature of the area.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as a visual guide for players navigating the Cooling Slope. It highlights the location of the Luoija Fragrant Vine on the left, which can be safely collected by hugging the rocks, and the cluster of rocks on the right, which may conceal dangers like the Searing-Fire mentioned in the walkthrough. This helps players identify key landmarks and prepare for potential threats."
