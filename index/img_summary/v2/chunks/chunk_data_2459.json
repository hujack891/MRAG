If you need to, use any rocks nearby that haven't been destroyed. You can then dodge in any direction to evade the attacks and do a quick double tap of dodge when you have multiple duplicates coming at you. If you're finding it difficult to dodge the attacks, Cloudstep can help you direct some of the attention away from yourself.",

The Red Boy is seen launching himself into the air with fiery spears, likely preparing for an attack involving duplicates. The surrounding environment is rocky and dark, with a large, white, fur-covered creature in the background, adding to the intensity of the scene. The preceding and following texts provide strategies for players to evade the Red Boy's attacks and counter with their own heavy attacks to interrupt and stagger him."
