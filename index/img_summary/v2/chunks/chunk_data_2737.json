These objects are likely a type of \"Soak\" item within the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" as inferred from the surrounding context. The preceding and following text describe various \"Soak\" items that offer temporary enhancements or effects when used, such as increasing Chill Resistance or extending the duration of abilities. This suggests that the image represents a specific \"Soak\" item that players can find and use within the game to gain strategic advantages."
