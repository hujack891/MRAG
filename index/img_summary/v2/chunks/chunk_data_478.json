    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a fast-paced combat scene in which the player character, wielding a staff, is attacking shambling zombie-like enemies. Glowing particles suggest the absorption of energy or health from the defeated enemies. In the background, Elder Jinchi hovers in a glowing, elevated pose, indicating his temporary invulnerability during this phase of the boss fight.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThis image illustrates the critical gameplay mechanic during the second phase of the Elder Jinchi boss fight. The player must eliminate the approaching bodies to prevent them from reaching Jinchi and restoring his health. It emphasizes the need for quick movement, stamina management, and precise attacks to outpace the enemies and weaken the boss."
