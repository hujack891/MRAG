This scene appears to be part of the journey toward locating Buddha's Eyeball 6 in *Black Myth: Wukong*. Based on the preceding and following text, the image likely represents the path leading up to the Mother of Stones boss encounter and the subsequent discovery of the Buddha statue with the eyeball on the cliff edge. It serves as a visual guide for players navigating this specific area."
