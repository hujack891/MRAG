Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.",
    "img_below_text": "When the battle starts, Kang-Jin Star will often summon small serpent-like electric projectiles to swim around her in the air before sending them your way. Watch her movement to see when she directs them so you'll know when to dodge their quick movement.\nThis boss doesn't move all that much, though she can teleport, meaning you'll be able to close the distance quite fast, but Kang-Jin Star will use a lot of spells to keep you at arms length.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts the beginning of the Kang-Jin Star boss fight in a snowy, mountainous arena. The player character, armed with a staff, faces off against Kang-Jin Star, who is surrounded by crackling electric energy. The HUD displays the player's health, abilities, and item options, emphasizing preparation for the fight.
