    "img_summary": "The image likely depicts a scene from a boss battle in a video game, specifically the fight against the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains. The preceding text advises players to eliminate white and black revenants before focusing on the Keeper. The following text indicates that once the Keeper's health is low, he will summon another enemy, Ma Tianba, for the player to fight. The image shows a dark, ominous figure in a desolate, misty environment, which aligns with the described intense battle scenario."
