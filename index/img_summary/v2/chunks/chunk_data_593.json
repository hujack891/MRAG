He'll leap at you -- just dodge back from this -- and then roll into the ball. You can attack him while he regains his composure when he's inside it.\nTo follow this, he'll put his sword away, then jump at you and slam the ball down. He'll then drag it around him. Both of these attacks can be avoided by keeping your distance. Attack when he's getting himself back together, and chip away at his health steadily.",
    "img_below_text": "When you've knocked his health bar down, he'll retreat and Top Takes Bottom will take over. She'll jump to get into her half of the ball and spin toward you. This will be quick, but you can dodge out of the way of this. She will also imitate Bottom Takes Top and leap up with her sword, eventually rolling into her half of the ball.\n![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \\(21\\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9d/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2821%29.png)",
