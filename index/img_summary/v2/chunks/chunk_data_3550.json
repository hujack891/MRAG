Locating him is much easier after collecting the upgrade that allows you to identify Spirits. You can find the Wolf Assassin on the way up to Bodhi Peak after exiting the cave.

The Wolf Assassin fights like many of the other wolves you will face on Black Wind Mountain - with knives. The Wolf Assassin can throw them, so make sure you keep your eyes peeled for any long-range attacks.",
