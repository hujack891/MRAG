The boss, engulfed in flames, is unleashing fiery eruptions across the arena after retreating and roaring at half health. Players must dodge the eruptions and manage burning effects using rolling or cooling powder. The following text suggests using the Fireproof Mantle, obtained from a secret boss, to mitigate fire damage and enhance focus for stronger attacks.\n\n2. **Purpose/Role**:  \nThe image visually represents the chaotic and fiery phase of the boss fight, emphasizing the need for strategic movement and preparation, such as equipping fire-resistant gear, to survive and counter the boss's devastating attacks."
