The character is wearing the Golden Feng-Tail Crown, signifying victory in the encounter. The background shows a battlefield strewn with fallen soldiers, fire, and blood, setting the stage for the next objective: activating the Keeper's Shrine and exploring nearby areas, including an optional miniboss encounter at Rhino Watch Slope. This image serves as a visual transition between defeating the Feng-Tail General and progressing to the next segment of the walkthrough."
