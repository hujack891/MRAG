Though the boss has two phases, you may not have as much trouble as you did with The Scorpionlord, since you won't have to deal with poison, and their attacks are a bit easier to read and counter. Strangely enough, it also starts the fight at around 75% of its health, but it does have a second health bar waiting, so pacing yourself can be the key to this fight.",
    "img_below_text": "Some of The Duskveils attacks can seem unconventional, but once you understand their moves, avoiding them will get easier. At range, they can leap into the air and unsuccessfully flap their wings as they kick out their legs, only to slam down on the ground, and then roll wildly. This means you'll need to either dodge immediately if they are in range, or wait to dodge when they roll.\n![Wukong PurpleCloud 57.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cc/Wukong_PurpleCloud_57.jpg)",
