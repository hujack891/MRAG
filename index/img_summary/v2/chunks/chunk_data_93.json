    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic moment from the boss fight against Baw-Lang-Lang in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The fiery attack shown is likely the frog boss's tongue whip, coated in flames, sweeping across the battlefield. The player character is seen evading the attack, emphasizing the need for precise timing to dodge or jump over the fiery tongue. This visual reinforces the narrative's focus on Baw-Lang-Lang's fire-based moves and the challenges of avoiding its powerful attacks."
