This visual represents the moment he gains the **Rock Solid Spell**, a defensive ability that allows him to parry attacks and stagger enemies.\n\n2. **Purpose and Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates the culmination of the battle against the Tiger Vanguard, where the headless musician rewards Sun Wukong with the **Rock Solid Spell**. This spell is a pivotal upgrade, replacing the Cloud Step ability and enabling a perfectly-timed defensive maneuver to negate incoming attacks and counter enemies effectively. The transformation into stone symbolizes the newfound defensive strength."
