    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a combat encounter in a snowy environment, where the protagonist is engaged in battle with a large, undead Frozen Corpse wielding a spiked mace. The background features a traditional Chinese-style structure and barren trees, emphasizing the eerie and desolate atmosphere. The UI elements indicate gameplay mechanics, such as health, abilities, and a notification about a \"New Lesser Yaoguai Anecdote\" being recorded.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates a key moment in the walkthrough of the Snowhill Path, where the player faces one of the Frozen Corpses described in the preceding text. These enemies, awakened by a monkey throwing fruit, are slow but dangerous, capable of performing swiping and leaping attacks. The following text highlights their low health and post-death thrashing, reinforcing the strategic importance of avoiding their final swings. The image serves to visually represent this encounter and the environmental context of the game."
