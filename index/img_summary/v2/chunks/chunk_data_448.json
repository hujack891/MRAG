Seeing him raise up his hand for this attack is one of the best times to try **Immobilizing him** and dealing enough damage to stagger him out of the attack before he can truly start it.\nSimilarly, you can use the Wandering Wight’s Spirit Attack to quickly stagger Jinchi, which is great for breaking him out of otherwise dangerous moves - provided you do so before the attack lands since it can still hurt your health bar.",

Now, finally, the shambling bodies will finally become a threat, and begin to glow as they chase you.\nThe good news is they don’t move all that fast, and must stop for a moment before finally exploding.

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a battle scene against Elder Jinchi, a boss character in a dark, atmospheric setting. Jinchi is unleashing a powerful glowing attack while surrounded by shambling glowing corpses, which are likely the followers he commands after losing health. The player character is visible in the foreground, seemingly evading or recovering from the attack. The glowing zombies appear to be part of the strategy described in the text, where they chase the player and explode after stopping briefly. This moment highlights the chaotic and dangerous phase of the fight, requiring careful movement and timing to avoid damage and continue the battle against Jinchi."
