    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a forest stream setting where the player character is observing a small Rat Guai near a stone statue head. The Rat Guai appears to be interacting with the statue before scurrying away, hinting at an opportunity to investigate the statue for a potential key item, the **Skandha of Form**. The environment includes rocky terrain, dense foliage, and water features, emphasizing exploration and discovery.\n\n2. **Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as a visual cue for players to investigate the stone statue head at the end of the stream after observing the Rat Guai's behavior. This interaction leads to acquiring the **Skandha of Form**, a mysterious key item that may have significance later in the game. It also highlights the game's emphasis on environmental storytelling and item collection."
