He can perform some surprisingly agile lunging attacks, and his multi-hit sword swings can deal a lot of damage.

By holding down the L2/LT button, you can move your staff quickly to deflect incoming arrows. The Wolf will usually begin with a barrage of quick arrow shots, so be sure to keep holding the button down rather than tapping it until he stops.

    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a tense combat moment on a forested bridge, with the player character using a defensive or counter-attack ability, likely the staff twirl, as sparks fly from an incoming attack. The environment is lush and atmospheric, with dense trees, moss-covered ground, and flaming braziers lighting the path.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThis image illustrates the gameplay mechanics described in the surrounding text, specifically the use of the Destined One’s staff twirl ability to deflect projectiles or counter attacks. The bridge, guarded by a Wolf Archer, serves as a key location for players to practice this defensive skill while progressing through the forested area. The visual reinforces the immersive and tactical nature of the encounter."
