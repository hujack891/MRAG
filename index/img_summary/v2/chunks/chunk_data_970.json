When he has the sword, you can expect projectiles to follow. These can be blocked by spinning your sword or dodging.\nThe problem with this stage is getting the timings right, as his attacks can often seem delayed from when they feel like they should end. If you're using Spells, do not try to use Immobilize until his shield is down again. You'll want to keep hitting him and use Cloudstep to build up your Focus, then whittle his shield down or use the Plantain Fan to do it, if you can get it back quickly. All other Spells aren't worth wasting your Mana on.",
