    "img_above_text": "Whenever you're close to the Flint Vanguard, it will go into combo punches. These are typical punches to the ground, and occasionally it will slam both arms down together. These can be dodged, and you'll be able to keep close to the Vanguard temporarily until pools of lava appear -- that's when you want to dash away.\nIt shifts to ranged attacks when you try to create distance, in the form of fireballs. This will just be a single shot each time, so it's easiest to dodge. It will also attempt to close the gap by flying over to you and smashing down.",
    "img_below_text": "When it starts to get enranged, it will slam its fists down and shake its head, sending out a barrage of fireballs. Run around when this occurs, to avoid as much of the fireballs as possible.\nGenerally, you want to stick close to the Vanguard, dodge the punches, and build up focus to perform heavy attacks. You can knock it over like this, where it will be on all fours, so you can target it while it's vulnerable.",
