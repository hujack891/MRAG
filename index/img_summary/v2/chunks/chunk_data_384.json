Utilize your new Immobilize Spell to bind him when it suits you best — either to ward off an incoming attack, catch your breath so you can heal, or use the moment to hit him from the side, and launch a heavy attack to send him sprawling.\nDon’t get too reckless, as the Immobilize Spell has a moderate cooldown, and uses a bit of your magic meter each time.
