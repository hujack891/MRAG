    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing the protagonist, Wukong, armed with his staff, approaching a large stone-like creature known as the Stone Vanguard in a desolate, rocky environment. The preceding and following text suggests that this encounter involves a strategic option to summon the Shigandang for assistance, provided the player has collected all six Buddha Eyeballs. The Shigandang can fight the Stone Vanguard and execute a powerful finisher, but will turn hostile afterward, adding complexity to the battle. The image visually sets the stage for this pivotal confrontation."
