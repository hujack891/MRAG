    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, eerie outdoor setting with barren trees, stone statues, and a campfire in the foreground. A red-dotted circle highlights a figure in the distance, likely the Pale-Axe Stalwart mentioned in the context. This scene appears to guide the player to locate and interact with the NPC after progressing through specific objectives involving the Brown-Iron Cart and Gray-Bronze Cart. The setting aligns with the narrative of seeking further dialogue and information from the NPC near a cliffside area."
