    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts an intense moment in the battle against Fuban, a sand-dwelling enemy in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The protagonist, Wukong, is seen leaping into the air as Fuban bursts through the sand with its horn, causing an explosion of debris and sand around them.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates a key phase of the fight where Fuban attacks by emerging from beneath the sand to skewer the player. It highlights the need for the player to use evasive maneuvers, such as the Pillar Stance, to avoid taking damage from the erupting sand and debris. This visual serves to emphasize the dynamic and strategic nature of the encounter."
