The preceding text describes the squire's ability to summon a spear of sand and launch it quickly, while the following text suggests using a retreating move to avoid the squire's sand attacks and then countering with a heavy thrust. The image serves to illustrate the intense and strategic nature of the combat against the Yellow-Robed Squire."
