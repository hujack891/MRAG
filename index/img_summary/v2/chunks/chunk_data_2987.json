    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" where the player character is in a lush, rocky forest environment, interacting with a glowing green wisp. This visual is related to the gameplay mechanic of absorbing spirits using a Gourd, as mentioned in the preceding and following text. The image illustrates the moment of encountering and potentially absorbing these spirits, which are crucial for gaining Will, a resource in the game. The context suggests that this interaction becomes more significant after upgrading the Gourd, allowing for greater benefits."
