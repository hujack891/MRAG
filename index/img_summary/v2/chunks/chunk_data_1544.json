    "img_summary": "The image depicts a gameplay moment from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing a battle against the \"Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master\" in a vibrant field of yellow flowers surrounded by rocky terrain and autumnal trees. The boss appears to be mid-action, with fiery and smoky effects suggesting an attack or ability in progress.

This spell seems to provoke a reaction from the boss, tying into the narrative of the guide."
