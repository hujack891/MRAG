It will run toward the building at the top of the peak and soon join Erlang, The Sacred Divinity, who you fought at the very beginning of the game. This time, however, it's a bigger challenge.\nErlang is undoubtedly one of the toughest bosses in the game. To make it harder, he has a health bar and a shield bar, and you'll need to deplete his shield to do maximum damage. There is a quick way to knock this down, however, and that's to use the Plantain Fan. Each time you're able to throw this out, it will get his shield gone in a few seconds. You can then make the most of his vulnerable state, by following up with heavy attacks.",
