The Yellow Wind Sage is using his trident spear to create powerful waves of force. The context suggests that the player must be cautious of the Sage's attacks, including a sequence of slashes and a backhanded swing, which can be countered by using the \"Rock Solid\" ability to parry and stagger the enemy for a counterattack."
