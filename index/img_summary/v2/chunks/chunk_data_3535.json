The character is in the midst of a watery environment, creating a shockwave effect. This image illustrates the challenging nature of the Whiteclad Noble's circular spear attack, which generates a delayed watery shockwave that players must dodge by moving towards the character rather than away. The image serves to visually represent the described combat mechanics and the difficulty of evading the attack."
