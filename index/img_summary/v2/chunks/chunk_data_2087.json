    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts the player character in *Black Myth: Wukong* approaching a large statue altar inside a temple. The character wields a spear and is mid-stride, heading toward the altar, which is illuminated by light filtering through the structure. A red marker highlights an interactable object at the foot of the statue, likely the small gold box mentioned in the context.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates the moment where the player reaches the massive statue altar described in the walkthrough. This is a key location where the player can interact with the gold box to obtain the **Body-Fleeting Powder Formula** and additional powders. It visually reinforces the narrative progression and highlights the importance of exploration and item collection in this area."
