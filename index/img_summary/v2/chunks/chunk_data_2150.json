This means you can only take a third of his health bar off before he'll stop taking damage and stun you, which is worth noting so that you don't try and unleash a huge stored up attack when he's about to start a new phase.\nEven worse, when you take off the first third of his health, he'll stun you with electricity and then smack you around with his mace. This unavoidable cutscene actually takes off around 40% of your health, and is what we like to call a dick move.",
