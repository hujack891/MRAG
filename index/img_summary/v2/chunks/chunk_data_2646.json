    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" showing a character standing at the base of a stone staircase leading up to a snowy area. At the top of the stairs, there is a Buddha head, which is significant for players as interacting with it grants the Skandha of Thought. This item is crucial for progressing in the game, as it can be used in Chapter 6 at Mount Huago alongside other Skandhas to access new abilities and paths. The image serves to guide players to this location and highlight the importance of the Buddha head interaction within the game's narrative."
