This visual emphasizes the deer's use of frost-based elemental attacks, particularly the creation of difficult-to-avoid tornadoes, which are a significant challenge in the first phase of the battle. The preceding and following text suggests strategies for players to mitigate these tornadoes, such as using the Wind Tamer vessel to clear them temporarily, allowing players to focus on dodging the deer's other attacks."
