    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic moment in *Black Myth: Wukong* where the player character, armed with a staff, is engaged in a sequence involving the First Prince of Flowing Sands. The wall in the background is breaking apart, likely due to a powerful attack or interaction, creating a cloud of debris and dust. This scene aligns with the preceding and following text, which explains methods to crack the wall, either by baiting the First Prince into lunging at it or using a spirit transformation for a head bash. The image visually represents the process of breaking the wall to progress in the game."
