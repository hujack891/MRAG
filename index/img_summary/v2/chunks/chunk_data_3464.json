The scene is part of the \"Middle Hollow\" walkthrough in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" The preceding text mentions \"Centipede Guai\" and \"Cliff of Oblivion,\" suggesting that Wukong has just encountered or defeated these entities.

The image serves to illustrate the challenging and eerie environment Wukong must navigate and the enemies he must face."
