    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic scene in a snowy, desolate environment, where a lone figure armed with a staff approaches a large temple-like structure engulfed in a bloody red miasma. This ominous visual sets the stage for an impending confrontation, likely with Captain Kalpa-Wave, as suggested by the narrative context. The miasma serves as a barrier that congeals into a miniboss encounter, emphasizing the tension and danger of the approaching fight in the game."
