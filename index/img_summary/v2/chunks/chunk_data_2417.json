This scene likely follows the defeat of the Feng-Tail General, as indicated by the preceding text, and serves as a visual representation of the aftermath of a significant battle. The character's elevated position suggests a moment of reflection or preparation for the next steps, which aligns with the subsequent instruction to activate the Rhino Watch Slope Keeper's Shrine."
