It is a formidable, fire-themed mechanical construct with a menacing design, positioned in a dark, rocky environment with eerie trees and ancient structures. The cart serves as the first boss encounter in this chapter, requiring players to focus on its arms to avoid fire attacks and dodge its fist slams. The Fireproof Mantle Vessel is recommended for this fight and subsequent battles in the quest."
