A player character is shown wielding a weapon, engaging with a fiery enemy (likely one of the Searing or Scorching-Flame enemies mentioned in the preceding text). The red dashed circle highlights a treasure chest in the distance, which ties into the following text describing the chest containing Refined Iron Sand. The arrows suggest a path forward, guiding the player toward the next clearing while cautioning against glowing patches that may conceal Flamlings. The image serves as a visual aid for navigating this hazardous area in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\""
