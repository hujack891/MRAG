    "img_summary": "The image depicts a gameplay moment from *Black Myth: Wukong*, where the player character is engaged in an encounter with the \"First Prince of Flowing Sands.\" The scene shows the wall being shattered, likely as part of the process described in the text, where either a powerful attack or baiting the boss into lunging at the wall is required to break it. Dust and debris fill the air, emphasizing the impact of the wall's destruction, which is a key step in progressing through this area."
