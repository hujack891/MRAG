Poisonous snakes summoned by Guangmou are visible, spitting venomous projectiles across the arena. The player appears to be evading the attacks while navigating the forested environment.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, and Narrative Role:**  \nThe image visually complements the following text, illustrating Guangmou's \"Boys\" attack, where he summons venomous snakes to overwhelm the player. It highlights the chaotic nature of the encounter and the need for strategic movement or defensive techniques, such as dodging or using the staff spin to nullify projectiles. This serves to emphasize the challenge and complexity of the boss fight."
