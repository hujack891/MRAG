But what will be, is the Tenner guarding it.\nApproach carefully and deal with the Tenner and the Flamlings that will appear as soon as you're close to the cart.",

This is one of the Five Element Carts, but it's already been dealt with. Get close to its mouth and pull the string when prompted. When you do, you'll hear the voice of Ma Tianba (the horse guai from previous chapters) coming from inside. Keep pulling the string until you've exhausted all dialogue, and then move on. There's nothing more you can do here for now, but we'll return later.\nFace away from the cart and back in the direction you came from. There's more to explore at the moment, before you continue up to the archway you can see in the distance.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, fiery environment featuring key elements relevant to the walkthrough narrative. A humanoid character stands in the foreground, armed and ready, facing a large, ominous Tenner creature on the right. Nearby, a green Wisp is visible, along with a chest on the left, marked for collection. The scene aligns with the preceding text, where players are instructed to approach cautiously, defeat the Tenner and Flamlings, and gather items. The image visually reinforces the player's objectives in this area, including combat preparation and item retrieval."
