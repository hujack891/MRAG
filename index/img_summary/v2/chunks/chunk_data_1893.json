The Mad Tiger is mid-leap, preparing a fast, slashing attack while the player-controlled Wukong dodges to evade. This scene highlights the boss's aggressive combat style, requiring precise timing to avoid its attacks and counter effectively. The text below the health bar, \"Food has come to me. Can't let you flee!\", emphasizes the predator-prey dynamic of the encounter."
