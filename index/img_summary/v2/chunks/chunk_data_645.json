Unfortunately, these enemies will respawn until you defeat the Commander, so you won't be able to get him alone so easily.",
    "img_below_text": "Knowing that the Daoists don't have a whole lot of heath, there are two things you have on your side: large area-of-effect Spirit Attacks, and your Pluck of Many Spell. The Pluck of Many is a great bet for disorienting the group as you attack, though results can vary, and you'll likely have to jump in an finish off a few Daoists yourself. One is even likely to drop the **Fruit of Dao Soak** for your Gourd!\nThis can get tricky, as the Commander Beetle won't just wait around patiently while you defeat his students. He can employ huge strikes that cleave the very ground in a line where he strikes, and if you aren't paying attention, you can usually get hit by the tremors before you know what's going on.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense battle scene from the Commander Beetle boss fight in a video game. The player character is engaged in combat with the Commander Beetle and several Sword Daoists in a courtyard setting. The Commander Beetle's health bar is visible at the bottom, and the player appears to be using a glowing weapon with area-of-effect abilities to manage the group of enemies. The scene aligns with the guide's description of defeating the respawning Daoists while avoiding the Commander's powerful attacks."
