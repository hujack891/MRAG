    "img_summary": "This image depicts the protagonist, Wukong, approaching a Daoist in a serene, overgrown courtyard near a traditional building. The Daoist appears non-hostile, standing calmly, and the text overlay suggests a reflective or mysterious tone: \"It's been long since any soul has trodden these hidden bounds.\" The preceding and following context indicates this is part of a narrative sequence where Wukong encounters Daoists in a village, some hostile and others offering quests, such as the flute-playing Sword Daoist who requests help with Amourworm eggs. The image likely introduces or sets the mood for this interaction."
