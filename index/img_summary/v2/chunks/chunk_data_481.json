The item provides **Burn Immunity** and increases **Focus** when activated, making it highly effective against fire-based attacks and environments. Its **equipped effect** significantly boosts Burn Resistance and grants immunity to Scorch Damage from lava-covered areas. The Fireproof Mantle is a reward obtained after defeating Elder Jinchi and is particularly useful against the chapter's final boss, who relies on fire-based attacks."
