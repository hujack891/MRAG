He’ll follow this with a slash from his sword rather quickly, and let the momentum carry him along the ground in a spin to perform a quick secondary overhead slash from his low position.\nIt will take him a moment to get to his feet afterward, but you’ll want to react fast and retaliate, and possibly Immobilize him, or there’s a good chance he’ll leap away and retreat before his next attack.",
