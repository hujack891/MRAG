    "img_summary": "1. **Summary**: The image depicts a snowy scene featuring a Treasure Hunter Human and a Green-Capped Martialist (a humanoid creature with animalistic features) interacting near a rustic wooden structure. The Treasure Hunter appears to be sharing information or clues, as suggested by the riddle-like text at the bottom of the image: \"Green without, round and sweet. Red within, a summer treat.\" This moment likely advances the narrative of the treasure hunt introduced in Chapter 3 of *Black Myth: Wukong*.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**: The image illustrates a key interaction in the treasure hunt questline. It highlights the player's encounter with the Treasure Hunter after saving him from Apramana Bats, setting the stage for the next steps in the quest. The riddle hints at a puzzle or item crucial to progressing the storyline."
