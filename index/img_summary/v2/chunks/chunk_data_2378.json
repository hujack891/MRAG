    "img_summary": "The image depicts a player character, likely Wukong, traversing a frozen lake toward a small tree on the far shore. The tree, marked with a red circle, is significant as its base holds a turtle chest containing the **Stranded Loong's Whisker Soak**, an item that enhances the duration of the Immobilize spell. This scene aligns with the guide's instructions to explore the right side of the frozen lake for valuable items."
