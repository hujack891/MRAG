The glowing red and fiery background suggests the presence of Cloudy Mist, who is described in the text as the first to appear and capable of emitting a flashbang attack. The dialogue at the bottom, \"Halt! Intruders... to the Princess' palace face death,\" adds narrative tension, indicating the player is entering a dangerous area guarded by these entities. The health bars for \"Cloudy Mist\" and \"Misty Cloud\" suggest an impending battle where both creatures will play distinct roles."
