    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic moment in *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing the protagonist, Wukong, wielding his staff amidst a dynamic and chaotic scene filled with lightning and glowing particles. This likely represents a key action or combat sequence near the sandfall barrier mentioned in the text, which requires the Loong Scales to bypass. The scene sets the stage for the upcoming Black Loong boss fight."
