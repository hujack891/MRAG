    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a tense battle scene set in a reflective, ethereal environment. Two figures are visible: one appears to be an archer, crouched and ready to attack, while the other wields a club-like weapon, standing in a defensive posture. The background features towering structures and a somber, cloudy atmosphere, emphasizing the dramatic and otherworldly nature of the confrontation.\n\n2. **Purpose/Role in Narrative**:  \nThe image visually represents the phase of the fight against the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains where summoned undead enemies, including white revenants (club-wielders) and black revenants (archers), enter the fray. The player is advised to prioritize eliminating the black revenants due to their dangerous ranged attacks before continuing the battle against the main boss. This scene highlights the strategic shift in combat dynamics during this stage of the encounter."
