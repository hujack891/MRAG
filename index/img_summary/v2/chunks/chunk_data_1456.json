    "img_summary": "The image depicts the \"Immortal Blessing Gourd,\" a Legendary item from the game *Black Myth: Wukong*. It is a handheld gourd with intricate, organic designs, likely symbolizing its mystical properties. According to the context, this item halves health recovery but temporarily boosts attack power after use. It can be purchased from the Shen Monkey Vendor in Black Wind Mountain starting in Chapter 5, provided the player has acquired the \"Buddha's Left Hand\" and \"Buddha's Right Hand\" items. The gourd plays a strategic role in enhancing offensive capabilities at the cost of reduced healing efficiency."
