    "img_summary": "The image depicts a serene forest setting with a wooden bell pavilion at its center, surrounded by bamboo trees and illuminated by soft light. A character, armed with a staff, stands in the foreground, facing the structure. This scene likely represents the location of the second bell in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" which players are instructed to ring after defeating Guangmou and ascending the stairs behind the arena."
