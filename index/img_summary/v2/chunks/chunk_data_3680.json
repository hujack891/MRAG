You'll actually gain the Apramana Bat Spirit during this sequence, and fly right at him only to be knocked to the ground - again taking off a chunk of your health in an unavoidable scene.\nIn this final phase, Yellowbrow is more likely than ever to summon his giant lighting blast again as he creates motes of lightning all around him, meaning you'll need to race to the far corner or use something like the Wind Tamer to snap him out of it.",
    "img_below_text": "He can also more frequently employ lots of very deadly moves, like repeatedly swinging his electrified mace around him in multiple arcs with large electric waves of force that have an additional delayed detonation.\nYou'll need to play things very smart and cautious now, and don't be afraid to pause and use additional consumables, including rare ones given by the Xu Dog in the Zodiac Village. This match is a true endurance test, and you'll want to use everything in your arsenal to keep Yellowbrow on the defensive.",
