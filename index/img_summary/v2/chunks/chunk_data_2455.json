However, his combos are thankfully short, so you'll only need to dodge a couple of times to avoid these swiping attacks and be able to follow up with your own.\nThat being said, if you're lucky, you'll experience moments where he actually stands still for a few seconds, preparing to attack. Take advantage of these opportunities when they present themselves, to get in as many hits as possible before he starts a combo of fire assaults.",
    "img_below_text": "When he does stand still -- or he's pausing from his own combos -- you won't be able to finish a combo of your own. It's best to just get a few hits in, then immediately jump back. This is because he'll breathe fire in a small arc directly in front of him as soon as you've hit him a few times.\nAs you'd expect from the final boss of The Flaming Mountains, the Red Boy uses a weapon imbued with fire and projectile fire attacks. For this reason, we'd recommend you stock up on Body-Cooling Powder and equip your Fireproof Mantle to help you should you start to take too much elemental damage.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a fiery landscape, likely part of the setting for the final boss battle against the Red Boy in \"The Flaming Mountains.\" The scene shows intense flames and a rugged, desolate terrain, emphasizing the hazardous environment where the Red Boy, a highly agile and fire-wielding enemy, confronts the player. This visual underscores the need for strategic preparation, such as using Body-Cooling Powder and a Fireproof Mantle, to withstand the elemental damage during the fight."
