    "img_summary": "The image depicts the Yaksha King, a formidable boss character in *Black Myth: Wukong*. He is shown wielding two glowing, fiery blades drawn from his elbows, standing in a rocky, cavernous environment illuminated by red flames and sparks. This visual aligns with the walkthrough's description of his combat style, including traditional blade attacks and projectile throws. The scene sets the stage for a challenging fight where Zhu Bajie assists the player."
