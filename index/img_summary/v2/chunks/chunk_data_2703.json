The character is seen in a snowy forest setting, wearing fur and beads, and is likely the body from which players need to obtain the fox form near the Shrine in the Forest of Felicity. The text overlay in the image suggests the character is requesting the player to take their fur and form to confront someone and calm their sorrowful heart, which is part of the narrative leading to the next objective at the New Thunderclap Temple entrance."
