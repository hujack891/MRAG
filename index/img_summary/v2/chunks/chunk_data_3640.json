The Yaoguai Core is described as being stained by cruelty and impudence, and is used for crafting weapons. The preceding text mentions the Stone Spirit as a basic material used for upgrades and crafting armor and gear, while the following text lists locations where the Yaoguai Core can be found, including occasionally in chests. This suggests that the image serves to inform players about the importance and usage of the Yaoguai Core in the game."
