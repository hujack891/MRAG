He’ll try and bait you into this when spreading his arms wide or crouching down, but try not to take the bait, and use the time to heal, use consumables, or ready a Transformation.\nAt the start, attacking him will prompt him to soak the blow and retaliate with a large punch when he comes out of his stone form. This time can be much better spent charging up your own heavy attack to hit him with the moment he comes out of the form and shakes off the dust.",
