    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a tense moment in the game *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing the protagonist battling the \"Elder Amourworm,\" a large, grotesque creature. The environment is dark and eerie, littered with skeletal remains and clusters of white formations resembling eggs or fungal growths. The player's health and abilities are displayed on the screen, emphasizing the intensity of the encounter.\n\n2. **Narrative Role**:  \nThe image highlights the Elder Amourworm's erratic and dangerous behavior, as described in the preceding text. The creature can slam its body to release poison and thrash about unpredictably, making it a challenging foe. The following text suggests that players must anticipate its movements and use defensive techniques like \"Rock Solid\" to counter its weight-based attacks. This visual reinforces the creature's intimidating presence and the strategic combat required to defeat it."
