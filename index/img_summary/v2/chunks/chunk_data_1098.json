    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense combat scene in a rocky, forested arena. A player character, armed with a glowing spear, faces off against a winged enemy mounted on a unicycle-like contraption. Red, glowing orbs—likely part of the enemy's attack pattern—are scattered across the battlefield. This visual aligns with the surrounding text, which describes the enemy's heavy attacks, including spinning unicycle movements and crisscrossing projectiles, emphasizing the challenge of avoiding these attacks. The image serves to illustrate the dynamic and hazardous nature of this boss encounter."
