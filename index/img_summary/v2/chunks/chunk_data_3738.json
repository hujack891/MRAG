    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" where the player character stands on a ledge overlooking a rocky and barren landscape. This location is significant as it is right above the area where the player previously fought the Stone Vanguard in Fright Cliff. The image serves as a visual guide to help players locate the large rock nearby, which is crucial for summoning the hidden Shiandang Yaoguai King boss by placing six Buddha Eyeballs. The red arrow in the image points towards the rock, emphasizing its importance in the game's narrative progression."
