You'll need a a lot of armor to withstand his hits, and plenty of poison defense to boot, which means using the Gall Soak, and poison-resistant curios to help you out.\nIf you recall your fights with the three Scorpion Princes in the Webbed Hollow, you may find more than a few of the Scorpionlord's attacks familiar, but don't be lulled into thinking you have him figured out: all of his moves strike faster, hit harder, and will evolve into longer combos as the fight drags on. Much of this fight will be learning his basic combos early, but being ready to adapt when he tricks you with extended attacks when you may otherwise think you have an opening.",
    "img_below_text": "While your initial fight will start with him crouching down before launching a very long piercing tail strike, all subsequent attempts will begin with him whirling away from you, only to leap toward you fairly fast.\nJust like the Scorpion Prince, he'll slash at you with his claw while still airborne in front of you, but quickly follow up with a tailswipe to quickly spin about, letting him slam down with his claw for a third hit. As you can see, he'll be very tricky in alternating between his claw and tail, and you'll only have a second to see either appendage glow to know where his attack is coming from and react.",
