    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character standing near a decrepit well surrounded by skeletons in a barren, desolate field. The on-screen prompt \"Jump In\" suggests the player is given the option to descend into the well, which is tied to the narrative context of encountering a potentially hostile entity below. This scene follows the use of the Rattle-Drum to summon the spirit of a boy, who invites the player to explore the ominous depths of the well."
