    "img_summary": "The image likely depicts the Boar character from *Black Myth: Wukong*, a significant figure in the narrative who seeks the \"Realm of Gold\" and plays a role in advancing the story. The preceding text mentions giving the Boar the Jade Lotus, prompting his departure from the temple, while the following text transitions to the \"senior brother\" and the quest for the Arhat Gold Piece, which ties back to the Boar's needs. This suggests the image highlights the Boar's pivotal role in this segment of the game."
