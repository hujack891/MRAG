    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing a desolate area with rocky terrain, dead trees, and a traditional Chinese-style gate in the background. A crouching figure, likely the player character Wukong, is positioned in the foreground near logs and small objects, suggesting stealth or preparation for an encounter. This setting aligns with the walkthrough's guidance to approach enemies strategically, lure melee attackers, and explore nearby areas for items like the green Wisp. The image sets the stage for advancing toward the next challenge, including the Yaoguai Chief mini-boss fight mentioned in the following text."
