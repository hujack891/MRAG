    "img_summary": "1. The image depicts a combat scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing the player character delivering a critical attack to Guangmou, a boss enemy. Guangmou is seen recoiling from the impact, with red visual effects emphasizing the damage dealt. The player's health, stamina, and ability icons are visible in the HUD, along with Guangmou's health bar, which is partially depleted.\n\n2. Based on the context, the image illustrates a pivotal moment in the fight against Guangmou, highlighting the player's offensive strategy. It aligns with the text's advice to exploit Guangmou's vulnerability in close combat, particularly during moments when he is unable to defend himself effectively. This visual reinforces the narrative of overcoming Guangmou's ranged and summoning abilities by closing the distance and attacking aggressively."
