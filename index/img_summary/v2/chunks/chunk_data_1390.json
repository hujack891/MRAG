The fight is fairly straightforward in this first phase, but as soon as you've defeated the horse guai, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains drops the Yin-Yang Fish into the water.\nThe giant creature soon emerges and will begin attacking. It has a variety of moves that you'll see it perform during the fight. But the main thing is now you should make use of all your spells and transformations that you saved from the first round.",

Staying close to it will stop it from being able to hit you with the jet spray, but will make it more likely to try and tail-whip you.\nIt will also use projectiles and throw out orbs to chase you down. These can be dodged or outrun in a similar manner to that of the Keeper of the Flaming Mountain's attacks.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic moment in the battle against the Yin-Yang Fish, a giant aquatic creature that emerges from the water after the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains drops the artifact into the lake. The creature is shown attacking, with water splashing violently around it and the player character attempting to evade or engage. The towering structure in the background adds to the ominous atmosphere, emphasizing the high-stakes nature of this phase of the fight. This scene visually represents the transition to the second phase of the encounter, where the player must adapt to the creature's varied attacks, including jet sprays, tail flicks, and chasing projectiles."
