    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the video game *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing the protagonist overlooking a rocky, arid area with a small pit below. In the pit, a large Toad Yaoguai and other enemies are visible, suggesting a potential combat encounter. The setting includes natural terrain with sparse vegetation, wooden scaffolding, and a looming ravine. This moment appears to guide players toward exploring an alternate path up into the hills, bypassing the immediate confrontation with the Toad Yaoguai."
