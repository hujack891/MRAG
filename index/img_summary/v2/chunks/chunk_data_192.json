    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from *Black Myth: Wukong* where the protagonist encounters the Xu Dog, a humanoid creature with animalistic features, in a dimly lit cellar. The Xu Dog is holding a glowing object and appears to be speaking, as indicated by the subtitle: \"Pray, refrain from blaming him. His ill temper persists unaltered since the first day of our long acquaintance.\" This moment likely serves as a narrative interaction, advancing the story and leading to the Xu Dog providing the player with a Special-made Bone-Strengthening Pellet and a formula for crafting Fortifying Medicament."
