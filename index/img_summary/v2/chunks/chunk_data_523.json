    "img_summary": "The image depicts a battle scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing the player character engaging the massive beetle-like boss, Fuban, in a desert environment. Fuban is lying on its side, exposing a vulnerable area, which aligns with the strategy described in the text: rushing in to deal heavy damage using charged strikes, Spirit Attacks, and Transformation Spells. The preceding and following text emphasize exploiting Fuban's stunned state while being cautious of its shockwave and explosive attacks. This image visually supports the narrative of the player's tactical approach to defeating the boss."
