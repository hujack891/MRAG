    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense combat scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, where the player character is engaged in a battle against the Centipede Guai and its smaller, explosive minions. The dark, cavernous arena is littered with bones and glowing green effects, emphasizing the ominous and chaotic nature of the fight. The smaller centipedes, shown rolling toward the player, are a key mechanic of the encounter, as they explode on impact and require strategic evasion. The image highlights the need for careful movement and timing to avoid being overwhelmed while preparing for the larger Centipede Guai's attacks."
