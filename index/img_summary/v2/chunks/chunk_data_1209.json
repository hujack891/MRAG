    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a player's perspective while transformed into a Golden Cicada, flying through a dense, atmospheric forest area. The transformation allows for scouting potential dangers ahead, as indicated by the text overlay: \"The cicada form may help you explore.\" A meter in the bottom left tracks the limited flight time, emphasizing the strategic nature of this exploration mechanic.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates the gameplay mechanic introduced after leaving the Shrine, where players temporarily adopt the Cicada form to safely survey the upcoming area. This transformation is part of the narrative progression, enabling players to assess threats like Wolf guards and mini-bosses before engaging directly. The forest setting reinforces the tension and danger of the journey ahead."
