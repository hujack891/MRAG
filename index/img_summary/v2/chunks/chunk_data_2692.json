The player character is poised on an icy surface, ready to engage with the dragon-like boss, which appears to be in motion, possibly preparing for an attack. The context suggests that the image illustrates a moment in the boss fight where the player needs to be prepared for rapid movements and attacks from Kang-Jin Loong."
