The glowing, spinning sphere at the center emits beams of energy, suggesting an imminent or ongoing powerful attack. The player character, partially obscured and seemingly mid-dodge, is positioned in the foreground, with visible health and stamina indicators, emphasizing the tense and strategic nature of the encounter.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image visually represents the described moment in the text where the boss's sphere begins its high-energy attack, sending out beams of electricity. It highlights the need for the player to anticipate and evade the incoming lightning strikes, as described in the preceding and following text. This serves as a visual aid to emphasize the danger and mechanics of this phase of the battle."
