This encounter is significant as it can only be accessed after obtaining specific items (Loong Scales) in Chapter 2 and returning to a specific location (Keeper's Shrine near the waterfall). The image serves to visually represent the intense and challenging nature of the secret boss fight described in the surrounding text."
