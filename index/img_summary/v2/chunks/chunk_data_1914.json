    "img_above_text": "The Mad Tiger is an extremely aggressive fighter with a plethora of moves ranging from punch combos, swipes, and leaps resulting in earth-shattering landings, rock showers, roars strong enough to knock you off your feet, and even a move where the boss picks up a massive boulder to obliterate you with. The Mad Tiger is a large enemy but extremely agile. **The key to this fight is Perfect Dodging.**\nMost swipe and punch moves are delivered in threes, often followed by a leap where the Mad Tiger soars into the air to crash back down on you. You will get a brief moment of reprieve when he lands to cast Immobilize, giving you time to land your own combo before he leaps back into action and you have to get back on the defensive.",
    "img_below_text": "Some bosses in Black Myth: Wukong can be handled with pure aggression, but this is not one of them. Choosing your moments wisely is imperative in this fight, and try not to get greedy. If you've got one hit left in your combo, but the boss is recovering, leave it. Retreat and attack again once the Mad Tiger is done with its next combo.\nStock up on all medicines before heading into the fight to boost your stats, and don't hold back on your spells because the Mad Tiger certainly isn't going to hold back on you!",
