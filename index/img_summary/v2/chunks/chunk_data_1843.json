The player is mid-attack, with their weapon glowing red, while the wolf looms over them, emphasizing its size and aggression. The setting appears to be a ruined outdoor area with scattered debris and overgrown vegetation.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image complements the surrounding text by visually illustrating the described combat mechanics and strategies. It highlights the wolf's imposing presence and the player's need to time their attacks and dodges carefully. The scene reinforces the advice given in the preceding and following text about anticipating the wolf's movements, such as its strafes, lunges, and claw swipes, to effectively counter its attacks."
