Unlike the earlier Crow Diviners, this one is not only empowered with a Spirit, but has even more deadly moves.\nIn addition to their quick dashing sword swings, Crow Diviners in the valley like this one can also blast out an icy chill your way while becoming nearly invisible aside from a purple glowing eye.",
    "img_below_text": "In this cloud step-like form, you'll only be able to see their purple eye flash before they lunge at you and deal incredible damage -- even causing purple explosions or icy blasts around their slash -- so be ready with a deflect or cloud step of your own.\nDefeating this particular foe will allow you to absorb the Crow Diviner Spirit (and another green Wisp nearby), but he won't be the only one you'll face in this area.",
