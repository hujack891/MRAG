    "img_summary": "The image depicts a boss fight in *Black Myth: Wukong* against the \"Black Wind King.\" The player character is seen mid-combat, wielding a staff, while the boss appears as a smoky, wisp-like entity on the ground. The surrounding arena features a natural, leafy environment with scattered debris and faint firelight in the background. This moment aligns with the guide's description of the boss's transformation into a wisp form, requiring careful observation to anticipate its charge attacks."
