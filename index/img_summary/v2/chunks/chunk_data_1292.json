The Stone Vanguard is shown performing a powerful ground-based attack, likely tied to its signature move of summoning Rock Guai. The player appears to be mid-battle, with visible attack options (\"Earth Shatter\" and \"Mountain Splitter\") and the boss's health bar displayed. This visual serves to illustrate the intense gameplay mechanics and strategies required to defeat the Stone Vanguard, as described in the preceding and following text."
