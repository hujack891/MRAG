    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts an intense moment in the battle against Fuban, a large, sand-dwelling creature in *Black Myth: Wukong*. Fuban is shown mid-attack, with its massive body lunging forward and kicking up sand, while the player-controlled character attempts to evade. The environment is a rocky, desert-like terrain, and the game's HUD displays health bars and abilities, emphasizing the combat scenario.\n\n2. **Purpose and Narrative Role**:  \nThe image illustrates Fuban's aggressive attack phase, likely the ramming maneuver described in the preceding text. It highlights the danger of this move and the need for players to anticipate and dodge effectively. The following text suggests this moment occurs before Fuban retreats to burrow into the sand for its next phase, emphasizing the progression of the boss fight."
