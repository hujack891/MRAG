    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" showing a character named Yellowbrow executing a powerful electrical attack with his mace. The context suggests that this attack involves slamming the mace into the ground, generating electrical currents that spread outwards. The preceding text advises players to back off and avoid the shockwave, while the following text describes additional ranged electrical attacks. The image serves to visually illustrate the described combat mechanics and the dramatic effects of Yellowbrow's electrical attacks."
