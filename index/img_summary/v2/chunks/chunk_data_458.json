    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic moment from the game *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing a player character engaged in combat with the Centipede Guai, a large, armored boss enemy. The Centipede is shown in its rolling attack form, a key move described in the preceding text, where it charges at high speed and bounces off walls to strike again. The following text highlights the importance of timing a \"Rock Solid Deflection\" to counter this attack, topple the Centipede, and create an opening for significant damage. The image visually reinforces the intensity of the battle and the mechanics needed to defeat this formidable foe."
