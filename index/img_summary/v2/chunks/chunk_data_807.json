This spirit has a skill called \"Frigid Fragrance,\" which allows the player to take the form of Crow Diviner and scatter Frigid Dust, applying Frost Bane to both the player and foes. The equipped effect of this spirit moderately increases Chill Resistance, enhancing the player's ability to withstand cold-related attacks. The interface displays various spirits available for selection, along with the player's basic attributes and resistances. The context suggests that the Crow Diviner is a formidable opponent with frost damage capabilities and an invisibility skill, making strategic engagement essential."
