    "img_summary": "The image depicts Fuban, a massive scarab Yaoguai (demonic creature) encountered in a sandy, desert-like environment. This imposing enemy serves as a secret boss in Chapter 2 of the game, introduced after the Yellow Rat Sage requests the player's help. Despite its intimidating size and appearance, the text suggests that the battle against Fuban is manageable with proper strategy and timing. The visual emphasizes the creature's menacing design and the dramatic setting of the fight."
