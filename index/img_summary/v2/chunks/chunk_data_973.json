The lighting highlights the mushrooms, emphasizing their texture and detail.\n\n2. **Purpose and Narrative Role**: The image complements the surrounding text, which advises players to \"harvest everything you see\" in their adventure. It likely serves as a visual example of harvestable resources (e.g., mushrooms) that players can collect for crafting medicines and other useful items later in the game. This reinforces the tip to gather materials early, even if their immediate use is unclear."
