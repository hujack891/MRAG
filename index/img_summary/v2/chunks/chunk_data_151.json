    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" showing the character Kang-Jin Star in her dragon form, creating a large electric dome attack. The player character is seen dodging this powerful attack by retreating to a safe distance. The electric dome expands and generates an electric ring along the ground, requiring strategic movement to avoid damage. This visual highlights the intensity of the encounter and the need for tactical evasion during close-range combat."
