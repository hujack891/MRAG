A red arrow highlights the path forward, while a red circle marks a glowing green object (likely the green Wisps mentioned in the text) on the left edge. In the background, a massive, partially visible figure and glowing lava streams add a dramatic and ominous atmosphere.\n\n2. **Purpose, Content, or Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as a visual guide for players to navigate the area after returning from Bishui Cave. It highlights key points of interest: the green Wisps to collect on the left and the path forward toward the Bull King and the Fallen Furnace Crater, where the next Keeper's Shrine is located."
