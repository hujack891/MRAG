    "img_summary": "The image depicts an in-game combat scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing the player character engaged in a fight with the \"Man-in-Stone\" boss. The boss is partially visible, surrounded by glowing effects and debris, indicating an attack or impact. The health bar at the bottom shows the boss's name and remaining health. The context suggests this is a relatively easy encounter, as the preceding and following text describe the boss as underwhelming and vulnerable to specific strategies."
