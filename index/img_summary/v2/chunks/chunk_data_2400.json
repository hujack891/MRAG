The scene is set in a desolate, battle-scarred area with other enemies, such as Revenants and Bull Soldiers, present but not the primary focus. The Pale-Axe Stalwart is wielding a large axe, preparing to swing it, while the player character is poised to dodge and counterattack. The image serves to illustrate the intense combat and strategy required to defeat this miniboss."
