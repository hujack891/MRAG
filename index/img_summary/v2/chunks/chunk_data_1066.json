    "img_summary": "1. **Summary**: The image depicts the protagonist, Wukong, standing in front of a cracked wall adorned with small statues, likely in the boss arena. The crack appears to be an entry point, with an on-screen prompt (\"Go In\") suggesting interaction. Wukong’s fiery staff and the surrounding debris imply the wall was broken either during the boss fight or through a powerful attack.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**: The image illustrates a pivotal moment where players can access a hidden area, \"The Loong’s Secret Tomb,\" after defeating the First Prince. If the crack wasn’t formed during the fight, players must use specific transformations or spells to break the wall and proceed. This serves as a transition point in the chapter, encouraging exploration and puzzle-solving."
