    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character holding a fiery staff in a dark, web-filled cave. The character is positioned near a green Wisp, with an option to \"Absorb\" it, and a patrolling enemy further down the tunnel. The preceding text suggests the character has just navigated past a Beetle Captain guarding an archway, while the following text indicates they are about to enter a long dark tunnel with additional enemies and another green Wisp to absorb. The image serves to illustrate a key moment in the game's narrative where the player must interact with the Wisp and prepare for upcoming challenges in the tunnel."
