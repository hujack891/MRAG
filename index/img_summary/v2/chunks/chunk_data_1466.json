    "img_summary": "This image depicts a snowy forest scene where the player character, armed with a staff, approaches a large, gnarled tree. A figure, likely the Treasure Hunter mentioned in the context, is seen sitting against the tree, appearing cold and in need of warmth, as suggested by the on-screen text: \"Fire. I need fire...\". The setting aligns with the \"Valley of Ecstasy\" region, specifically near the \"Towers of Karma\" area, where the Treasure Hunter is found struggling with the cold. The image serves to illustrate a key moment in the narrative where the player encounters the Treasure Hunter again and progresses their quest."
