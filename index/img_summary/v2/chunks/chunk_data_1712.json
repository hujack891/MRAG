The boss is shown mid-attack, surrounded by debris and a reddish glow, likely from a powerful slam or roar-based move. The preceding and following text describe the boss's abilities, including a projectile attack after roaring and a ground slam that causes rocks to erupt, both of which are visually consistent with the scene. The player's health bar and abilities are visible in the HUD, emphasizing the intensity of the encounter."
