The Guai is found in a small clearing to the right of the Ashen Pass III Keeper's Shrine. The clearing itself will have a few mushrooms growing in it, one of which is the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai. Pick them all to lure the Guai out of hiding.",
    "img_below_text": "## Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai Fight\nThe Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai fight is a bit of a tricky one thanks to the Guai's unique skill. The Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai can cover you in a thick layer of red spores that hinder your movement and poison you. These spores hang around for a long time and can severely impact your fighting. Other than its mushroom-inflicting skill, it fights with a staff and poison, similar to the other mushroom enemies you will have faced thus far in your journey.",
