    "img_summary": "The image depicts a tense moment from the miniboss fight against the Centipede Guai in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The player character is positioned in a dark, eerie environment filled with skulls and bones, facing the airborne Centipede Guai, a large, multi-legged creature with a glowing red eye. The health bar at the bottom indicates the boss's name and current status, while the UI elements show the player's abilities and resources. This scene aligns with the guide's description of the boss's aggressive attacks and the recommendation to prepare anti-poison items for the fight."
