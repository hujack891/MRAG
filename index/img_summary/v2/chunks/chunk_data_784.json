He’ll try and bait you into this when spreading his arms wide or crouching down, but try not to take the bait, and use the time to heal, use consumables, or ready a Transformation.\nAt the start, attacking him will prompt him to soak the blow and retaliate with a large punch when he comes out of his stone form. This time can be much better spent charging up your own heavy attack to hit him with the moment he comes out of the form and shakes off the dust.",
    "img_below_text": "Unfortunately, after the fight goes on for a bit, he won’t wait around to fool you. Whether you strike his stone form or not, he’ll use his own version of Cloud Step to race around the arena, and try to ambush you from a random angle. Watch for the signs of the blood splashing to anticipate where he’s coming from, and either let your stamina recharge to evade, or turn the tables on him with a Cloud Step of your own when he comes out of hiding.\nAfter the fight has raged for a bit and you may think you have a handle on this, you must still beware the Tiger Vanguard’s sword. He may deploy it sparingly, but when unsheathed it can deal a world of hurt and easily kill you before you’re able to find a time to heal. Knowing when that blade is coming is crucial to surviving the latter half of the fight.",
