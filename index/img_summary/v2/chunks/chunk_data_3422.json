The character can choose to go right, leading to the Middle Hollow \"village,\" or left, leading to an optional area. This decision point follows an encounter with a Grasshopper Guai that drops a valuable item, the Locust Antennae Mask. The image serves to illustrate the player's choice of paths and the atmospheric setting of the game."
