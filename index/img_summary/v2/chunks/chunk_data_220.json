A glowing green aura is visible on the ground, which is likely the **Turtle Tear Gourd Soak**, a key item mentioned in the context. This item is described as a rare and valuable resource for restoring mana when using the Gourd. The scene aligns with the narrative progression, where Wukong retrieves the tear following the mourning of the Serpent General by the Turtle General."
