Hang back as far as you can when this happens to avoid them.\nIt will then start to breathe fire from its mouth as a jet, in which case, you'll want to get behind it and attack. Lastly, you'll see a change in its leap attacks. Wherever it jumps, it will send out small waves of fire in a circle around it.

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic scene from a video game where a large, blue-skinned creature, resembling a frog, is in the midst of a fiery attack. The creature is seen spewing flames from its mouth, creating an intense and dangerous environment. The context suggests this is part of a boss battle, where the player must navigate and strategize against the creature's various fire-based attacks, including its fiery tongue and leaping maneuvers. The image captures the moment when the creature is unleashing fireballs, a key phase in its attack pattern, emphasizing the need for the player to maintain distance and avoid the flames."
