    "img_summary": "The image depicts a tense moment from the game *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing the \"Monk from the Sea\" mid-air during an attack. The snowy environment highlights the danger of his frost-based abilities, which can rapidly increase the player's frost meter. The player character is seen preparing to defend, emphasizing the need for strategic repositioning to avoid frost damage and the Monk's deceptive leap attacks. The scene visually reinforces the challenging nature of this boss fight."
