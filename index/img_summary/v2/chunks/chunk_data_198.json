    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat encounter in *Black Myth: Wukong*, where the player character, Wukong, is engaged in a snowy environment, facing off against a flying yaoguai (a lesser Apramana Bat). The yaoguai is airborne, preparing an attack, while Wukong appears to be readying a counter move, with his staff glowing and a fiery effect surrounding him. The HUD displays health, abilities, and controls, emphasizing the active battle scenario. This scene aligns with the guide's advice on dealing with these enemies' airborne attacks."
