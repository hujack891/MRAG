One attack will have him start with a shoulder check, and then expel energy from his raised palm. He'll quickly flow into a sweeping punch and two spinning kicks all in a row, which again is where moves like Cloud Step or Immobilize can help grant you some breathing room.\nExpect this fight to take you awhile to learn. For any chance of winning, you'll need to learn his first phase enough to the point you can power him down quickly before he can do much damage in return, and save the majority of your healing for phase two.",
