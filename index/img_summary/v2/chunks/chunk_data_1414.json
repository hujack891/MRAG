The Goat Skull provides a temporary health boost when using the Gourd, making it a valuable aid during combat. However, Soaks like this cannot be upgraded, and players may need to visit the Shen Monkey Vendor to swap them for other Soaks as they progress in the game. The item is part of the Drinks and Soaks category and emphasizes strategic use for survival and aggression in battles."
