    "img_summary": "The image depicts the Son of Stones, a formidable boss in the game Black Myth: Wukong. The boss is shown amidst an intense elemental attack, with a blue glow and lightning emanating from its body. This visual highlights the moment when the Son of Stones is charging up its powerful lightning attacks, which players need to evade and prepare to counter using Shock-Quelling Powder. The context suggests that this is a critical phase where the boss will eventually knock itself out, providing players with an opportunity to attack."
