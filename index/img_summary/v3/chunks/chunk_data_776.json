You can first reach this area by heading through the Sandgate Village and defeating the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, taking the left path through the Valley of Despair and through a crack in the wall leading to a small canyon.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Tiger Vanguard\nCompared to the slow and measured slams of the Stone Vanguard, the Tiger Vanguard is a relentless beast of a foe. You’ll need to be well prepared to take him down, and make sure you have the best armor and weapons crafted. If you haven’t been using them much before, now is also an excellent time to invest in crafting consumable medicines. Items like the Evil Repelling Medicament to reduce incoming damage, and the Tiger Subduing Pellets to increase your own.\n\nDespite carrying a sword on his back, it’s the Tiger Vanguard’s fists you’ll need to worry about — at least for the start. He’ll use adapting martial arts moves with a mix of heavy punches, kicks, and slams that can come from any direction due to his agile movements.",
