    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, mystical scene featuring a creature resembling Wukong, the Monkey King, enveloped in a hazy, ethereal environment. This visual accompanies the description of the bad ending in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" where The Destined One kneels face to face with Wukong after obtaining all of the Great Sage's Six Senses. The image underscores the somber and enigmatic nature of this default ending, highlighting the narrative's conclusion where a crown falls into the water, symbolizing a failed triumph."
