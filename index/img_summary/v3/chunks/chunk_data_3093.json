Below you'll find a guide for the Valley of Ecstasy Region, including how to reach the valley itself by defeating Non-White, and exploring the different parts of the valley to uncover several Yaoguai Chiefs on the path to the New Thunderclap Temple, and completing the Treasure Hunter's Quest and the Pagoda Realm Prisoner's Quest by defeating the final Captain.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Mindfulness Cliff**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-White\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-White (Round Two)\n* **Forest of Felicity**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n* **Brook of Bliss**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Able\n* **Towers of Karma**\n* Yauoguai Chief - Old Ginseng Guai\n* **Longevity Road**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Captain Kalpa-Wave\nAfter you solved the monk's riddle by praying at four Buddha Statues in the Precept Corridor, you'll split up from Zhu Bajie and make your way into the belly button of a large Buddha statue along the cliffs, taking you up a narrow pathway and into the Mindfulness Cliff.\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-Able\nDon't mistake his subdued appearance for weakness, Non-Able is probably one of the toughest Yaoguai Chief bosses you'll face in Chapter 3. Unlike other enemies, he won't use any magic or ranged tricks on you, and trades it all in for overwhelming power and a mastery of martial arts that makes him an extremely challenging foe -- and that's before the restraints come off.\nIf you haven't made use of them in other fights, now is definitely the time to take advantage of all the medicinal pills and consumable buffs you can craft and use. Items like the Tiger Subduing Pellets to raise your attack and others that can raise your stamina or focus can all help out greatly, and you'll want every advantage on your side.\n\nIf you can believe it, this boss still has more kick attacks to show off, and can now unleash a quick three-hit combo after starting to crouch down and angle his head to your left. Watch out for his incredibly fast roundhouse kicks to fly out one after the other, and only after the third will he pause to stretch out his leg and give you room to retaliate.",
