    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense combat scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, specifically during the Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight against the Macaque Chief in the \"Floating Sculpture\" subsection of the New Thunderclap Temple walkthrough. The character, wielding a glowing red sword, is shown unleashing a powerful attack surrounded by red energy effects, suggesting heightened abilities or infused power. The setting features a detailed, temple-like environment with statues and intricate architecture, reinforcing the narrative's focus on the temple's mystical and ominous atmosphere. This moment aligns with the guide's description of the Macaque Chief's empowered state and the protagonist's enhanced abilities after interacting with the Clay Vajra."
