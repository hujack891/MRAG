Taking double damage from any of his attacks is highly inadvisable, so make sure your Shock-Quelling Powder is on your quickbar for this fight.\nYellowbrow chiefly attacks with a large spiked mace while he holds his magic seedbag in the other hand. Be incredibly wary of his weapon, as it has the ability to change its shape, and he can extend the handle at will both in size, length, and flexibility.\n\nFinally, in his angered state he can also unleash a much longer combo attack, often while yelling about how he's going to guide the world. If you can't get enough distance from him, be ready to try deflecting or Immobilizing him, or you'll have to dodge a series of three sweeping attacks as he slides his mace along the ground, then swings it over his head four times, followed by a large windup as he pulls it around from behind his back in one large sweeping strikes.\n\nThe better understanding you have of his attacks and their range, the more ready you'll be to deal with each of them in turn, evading his lightining strikes and quelling any shock status to minimize damage. Use the downtimes from his slower attacks to hit him hard with Spirit Attacks and expending your Focus Points to stagger him onto the ground.",
