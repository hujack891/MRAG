Below you'll find a guide to accessing the mountain by defeating the Venom Daoist, and how to complete Hong Yi the Snake Guai's quest to defeat the Daoist Mi and Duskveil, as well as the formidable Scorpionlord.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* How to Access Purple Cloud Mountain\n* **Valley of Blooms**\n* **Bounds of Deity's Abode**\n* Yaoguai King - The Scorpionlord\n* **Petalfall Hamlet**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Daoist Mi\n* **Cloudnest Peak**\n* Yaoguai King - The Duskveil\nThis Chapter 4 Secret can only be accessed by finding and defeating the Venom Daoist in two different locations, and will transport you to a different location to fight a secret Yaoguai King and repair a Vessel that is instrumental in defeating the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - The Duskveil\nThe Duskveil is a disfigured and undead creature that -- despite its strange appearance -- behaves like an overgrown rooster, using a variety of stomping or charge attacks, in addition to being able to fly up and out of reach. Though the boss has two phases, you may not have as much trouble as you did with The Scorpionlord, since you won't have to deal with poison, and their attacks are a bit easier to read and counter. Strangely enough, it also starts the fight at around 75% of its health, but it does have a second health bar waiting, so pacing yourself can be the key to this fight.\n\nThese charges can be deflected or dodged, and after the fourth charge he'll stumble to the ground where you'll have a big chance to unleash some damage.\n\nWhen you deplete its health bar, a new phase will begin as a Blood Moon pierces the sky, making things look especially eerie. In reality, not too much will change for this second phase, except some bold new moves where The Duskveil pulls out a skeletal sword from its own mouth!",
