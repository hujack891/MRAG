Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of Yellow Wind Ridge: Sandgate Village, as well as how to defeat its many bosses that include Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, the Earth Wolf, the King of Flowing Sands and his First and Second Rat Princes.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Village Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* Yaoguai Chief - Earth Wolf\n* Yaoguai Chief - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n* **Valley of Despair**\n* Yaoguai Chief - First Prince of Flowing Sands\n## Village Entrance\nMake sure to take the time to view the new additions to the Chapter 2’s Shrines menu. Note that you can still freely fast travel back to any Shrine in Chapter 1’s Black Wind Mountain if you missed out on any secrets. The store is also selling very different items than it was in the previous chapter, and you’ll find that the selection will change based on which chapter you are in:\nYellow Wind Ridge Shrine Shop\nAntimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |\nMind Core (x2) - 720 Will | Silk (x2) - 600 Will | Yaoguai Core (x2) - 450 Will |\nLicorice (x5) - 120 Will | Aged Ginseng (x5) - 90 Will | Fragrant Jade Flower (x5) - 120 Will | Purple Lingzhi (x5) - 90 Will\nFire Bellflower (x5) - 120 Will | Jade Lotus (x5) - 90 Will | |\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw\nThe frog in question is the one you may have seen from the pond earlier, down in a large flooded pit nearby. While he has much in common with the other optional frog boss from Black Wind Mountain, he’s got a few new attacks you’ll need to prepare for.\n\nAt the top of the hill is one last shack, where you’ll find a big chest holding a **Blood of the Iron Bull** , 1 **Small Piece of Gold** , and 4 **Tiny Piece of Gold**. Plus, if you circle around the back, you can harvest a Fragrant Jade Flower.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the video game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the \"Sandgate Village Walkthrough\" section. The player character is seen approaching a shack at the village entrance, which is part of the Yellow Wind Ridge area. The character is equipped with a staff and has 56 Will, a game currency. The text overlay \"Oi, look there-a monkey!\" suggests interaction or observation within the game. This area introduces players to new items available in the shrine shop and sets the stage for the upcoming mini-boss fight against Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, the Yaoguai Chief."
