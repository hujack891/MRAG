Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the grove and learning how to cultivate Spirits, accessing a secret realm, as well as how to defeat the many bosses of this area that include Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, Guangmou, and the Whiteclad Noble.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Back Hills**\n* **Snake Trail**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n* Yaoguai Chief - Guangmo\n* **Marsh of the White Mist**\n* Boss FIght - Whiteclad Noble\n## Boss Fight - Whiteclad Noble\nThis snake-like noble will attempt to test your resolve, and he’s got the skills to back it up, so don’t take this boss lightly. Oddly enough, despite his appearance, he doesn’t employ any poison attacks, so having the Celestial Lotus Seeds as your gourd’s Soak is the better option for this fight.\nThe Whiteclad Noble opts instead to attack with his strong spear, and can harness the power of water itself to amplify its reach. He’ll use it often to create waves of watery force you’ll need to dodge or suffer a lot of damage from. He’s also not above simply tossing his spear at you, and then calling it back to his hand.\n\nHis most common attack up close from a series of spear swings — starting with two quick swings and the delayed thrust — or sometimes three slower swinging attacks. Oftentimes, he’ll follow these with another set of five quick spear swings, and ending with a sixth jumping attack. Unless you have a full bar of stamina, dodging the bulk of them can prove tricky, so you may want to dance out of range until you can dodge under his final jump and then retaliate — or use your Immobilize Spell to interrupt his combo entirely.",
