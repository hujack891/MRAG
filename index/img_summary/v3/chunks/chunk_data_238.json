    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy, mountainous area with intricate stone carvings, including large Buddha statues embedded in the rock face. A character is seen standing on a stone bridge, which is part of the Precept Corridor in the Bitter Lake region of the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" This area is described as a path leading to a cave-like room where the final Buddha statue is guarded by a Red-Haired Yaksha. The image serves to illustrate the environment and atmosphere of the Precept Corridor, enhancing the narrative of the walkthrough guide."
