You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive. You should also have the Loongwreathe or Kang-Jin Staff, and have a good set of spells equipped that compliment your attacks -- we reccomend Immobilize and Rock Solid, but you can also try using the Ring of Fire to buff yourself up in since the arena is small.\nThe Cyan Loong doesn't have a huge amount of attacks, but when they hit, they hit hard!\n\nHowever, once you manage to get his health down to around half, he'll imbue his sword with electricity in drawn out flourish, ending with him stabbing the sword into the ground to send up electric blasts all around him. You can try poking him from a distance with the Thrust Stance but be wary not to get too close.",
