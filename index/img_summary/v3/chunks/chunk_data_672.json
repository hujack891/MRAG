This scene is likely part of the journey to find the Cloudtreading Deer, a significant Yaoguai Chief in Chapter 6 of \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" The red trees mark the entrance to a clearing where players will encounter the Keeper's Shrine, essential for progressing in the game. The image serves as a visual guide to help players locate this area after defeating the third Poison Chief."
