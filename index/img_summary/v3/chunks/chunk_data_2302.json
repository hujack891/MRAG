He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\n\nIn this second phase, the rings in each corner will stay largely dormant, but can still activate with a flash to shoot a laser at you, which you'll need to dodge alongside the laser from his crystal. Luckily they seem to all shoot at once, so you only need to keep one ring in view when continuing the fight.",
