    "img_summary": "The image depicts a desolate and eerie landscape within the Woods of Ember, a key area in Chapter 5 of the game Black Myth: Wukong. The scene features a cobblestone path leading through barren trees and rocky terrain, with a character standing on the path holding a staff. A glowing blue flame is visible in front of the character, suggesting a mystical or supernatural element. This setting is part of the \"Height of Ember\" section, where players encounter the Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones, a boss fight that requires strategic combat techniques. The image serves as a visual representation of the environment players will navigate and the atmospheric tone of the game during this segment."
