    "img_summary": "The image depicts a desolate, rocky landscape with bare trees and ancient structures, suggesting a setting for a boss fight in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" A character stands on a stone path, facing a glowing blue spirit, which is likely the Father of Stones Spirit mentioned in the context. This spirit is a reward for defeating the Father of Stones, a Yaoguai Chief encountered in Chapter 5 at the Heights of Ember. The image serves to illustrate the aftermath of the boss fight, where the player collects the spirit left behind."
