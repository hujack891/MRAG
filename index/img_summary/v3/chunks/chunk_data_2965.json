    "img_summary": "The image depicts a crafting menu from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically showing the option to craft a \"Bronze Monkey Mask\" under the \"Craft Armor\" section. The mask offers defense and burn resistance, along with special abilities that enhance combat effectiveness. The preceding text explains that Keeper Shrines in the game will expand as players progress, allowing them to craft weapons and armor, which is demonstrated in the image. The image serves to illustrate the crafting mechanics available at Keeper Shrines, reinforcing the idea that these shrines are more than just places to rest and recover."
