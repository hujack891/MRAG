You can prepare to mitigate his attacks by making sure you've crafted the Loongscale Armor Set, are stocked up on Shock-Quelling Powder, and apply the Soak to your Gourd that increases shock resistance.\nWhile he's nowhere as strong as the other dragons you've faced, you don't want to get to cocky, or you may find his electric attacks peeling off more of your health than you can restore, even with Zhu Bajie helping out.\n### The Zodiac Village of the Painted Realm\n\nWhile it can't be upgraded from its base of 36% health restored, it not only increases your movement speed after drinking, but can hold up to three different Soaks, making it an incredibly versatile Gourd Drink to equip for boss fights!",
