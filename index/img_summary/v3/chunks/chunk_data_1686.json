    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character standing in front of several baskets containing harvested ingredients in a rustic, outdoor setting. The scene is likely from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong\" and relates to the section titled \"How to Use Seeds and Harvest Ingredients\" from the document \"How to Unlock the Zodiac Village and Upgrade Armor.\" The baskets appear to be part of the process where players can harvest ingredients after giving seeds to an NPC named Chen Loong, who is located near the stairs behind Shen Monkey and Xu Dog. This visual serves to illustrate the in-game activity of harvesting ingredients, which is part of the broader gameplay mechanics discussed in the document."
