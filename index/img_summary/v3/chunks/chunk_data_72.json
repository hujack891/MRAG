Be sure to check all of his options out:\n\n* Upgrade Gourds - By using the Luojia Fragrant Vine you just found by the nearby Shrine, you upgrade the charges in your Old Gourd from 4 swings to 5, turning into a Medicine Gourd, and giving you more uses of its healing properties.\n* Upgrade Drinks - The default drink stored in your healing Gourd is Coconut Wine, which restores a third of your health for each swig. Once you find Awaken Wine Worms, return to him and you’ll be able to upgrade the amount healed with each use!\n* Brew - With your equipped Drink, you can enhance it by adding a Soak to increase additional effects beyond the heal. You can try it out now by adding the Gall Gem, which will increase your poison resistance in addition to the heal from your Gourd.\n* Store - If the Gall Gem isn’t all that enticing, be sure to check his shop, as the Shen Monkey sells **Celestial Lotus Seeds** , which can be used as an alternative Soak that continues to recover some health after the gourd’s initial heal!",

The environment includes a large, intricate stone carving of a figure, suggesting a mystical or ancient atmosphere. This image likely illustrates the narrative context of exploring the Marsh of the White Mist, where players interact with the Shen Monkey merchant to upgrade healing items and enhance their abilities for upcoming challenges in the game."
