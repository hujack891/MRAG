Be sure to check all of his options out:\n\n* Upgrade Gourds - By using the Luojia Fragrant Vine you just found by the nearby Shrine, you upgrade the charges in your Old Gourd from 4 swings to 5, turning into a Medicine Gourd, and giving you more uses of its healing properties.\n* Upgrade Drinks - The default drink stored in your healing Gourd is Coconut Wine, which restores a third of your health for each swig. Once you find Awaken Wine Worms, return to him and you’ll be able to upgrade the amount healed with each use!\n* Brew - With your equipped Drink, you can enhance it by adding a Soak to increase additional effects beyond the heal.
