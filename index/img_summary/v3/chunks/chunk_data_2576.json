    "img_summary": "The image depicts a monstrous, multi-limbed creature labeled \"The Duskveil,\" set against the backdrop of an ancient, overgrown structure. This scene aligns with the narrative in Chapter 4 of the document titled \"Secrets,\" specifically within the section \"The Duskveil - Purple Cloud Mountain.\" The preceding text describes a quest involving Daoist Mi and a boss battle, suggesting that the creature shown is likely the boss encountered after obtaining the Violet Hail."
