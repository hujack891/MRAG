This Yaoguai King is a large hulking beast of a wolf that hits as hard as he is big. Luckily, for all his size, his attacks come with clear telegraphs to help you dodge and counter his moves.\n\nRemember you can also employ the Immobilize spell to keep him penned in if he strafes too much to hit, or you can use it to shut down his damaging roar or swipes so that you can interrupt his attack and hit him with a charged strike.\n\nWith his slow attacks, he’ll be easier to read than Guangzhi, making this battle one of patience and getting your hits in where you can before falling back to wait for the next attack you can dodge and punish. Once the mighty Lingxuzi falls, you’ll earn the **Grey Wolf Mask** and a **Mind Core** — a unique upgrade material.\n\nLingxuzi",
