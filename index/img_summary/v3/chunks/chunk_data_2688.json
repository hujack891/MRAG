    "img_summary": "The image depicts an underwater scene with a dark, murky atmosphere, showing a humanoid figure and what appears to be a dragon-like creature submerged in icy depths. This visual aligns with the narrative described in the metadata and context, where the Yaoguai Queen, Kang-Jin Loong, is defeated and sent into the lake's icy depths, followed by the protagonist being dragged down as well. The image serves to illustrate the climactic moment of the boss fight and the transition to the next chapter, \"The Pagoda Realm,\" in *Black Myth: Wukong*."
