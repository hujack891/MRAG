You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis.\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Emerald-Armed Mantis\nZhu Bajie will be on the floor and pick up a mantis from the ground. It will hop inside Bajie's mouth, and you'll need to do the same to be able to fight the insect. You'll soon be transformed and literally entering the belly of the beast.\n\nThe mantis will now become quite erratic with its movements, flipping all around the stomach. Immobilize will help out with this, but so will the Plantain Fan, which will push the Mantis back to a part of the stomach and pin it there for you to attack.

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from Chapter 6, within the \"Mantis-Catching Swamp\" section. It shows a character, likely the player or Zhu Bajie, engaging in a battle against the Yaoguai Chief known as the Emerald-Armed Mantis. The setting appears to be inside a creature's stomach, characterized by a dark, organic environment with a misty atmosphere. The character is wielding a flaming weapon, preparing to confront the large, menacing mantis. This image illustrates the intense and fantastical nature of the boss fight described in the walkthrough."
