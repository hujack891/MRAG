    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" showing a character standing in a rugged, rocky landscape near a tree adorned with glowing, golden berries. This tree is likely a Luojia Fragrant Vine, an in-game item that players collect to increase their health. The specific location is identified as Windrest Bridge in the Yellow Wind Ridge area, as mentioned in the metadata and preceding text. The glowing berries and the character's stance suggest the discovery or collection of the vine, which is described as being somewhat hidden or guarded."
