It shows a character approaching a large, ancient gate guarded by archers, which is part of the \"Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Earth Wolf\" sub-section. The character appears to be preparing to enter the gate, which leads to a path where players can find a chest containing gold pieces. This image serves to illustrate the environment and the next steps players should take after defeating the archers."
