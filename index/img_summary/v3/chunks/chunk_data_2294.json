He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\n\nIf you're up for the challenge, carefully drop down onto a rooftop in the pit below to avoid taking fall damage, then jump onto rocky rubble below to face this foe.",
