The Coconut Wine is the default drink provided at the start of Chapter 1 and offers a basic yet effective health buff, especially when used with Gourds. Players can upgrade its potency by collecting Awoken Wine Worms and using them at the Shen Monkey Vendor. The image serves to illustrate the appearance and basic function of the Coconut Wine within the game, emphasizing its role in health restoration and its potential for upgrades."
