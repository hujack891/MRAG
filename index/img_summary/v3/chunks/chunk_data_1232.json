This Yaoguai King is a large hulking beast of a wolf that hits as hard as he is big.

These attacks are usually simple swipes with a big delay, so wait for the claw to descend before dodging and attacking. His two-hit attacks only come from his leaps, so as long as he’s stationary, his attacks will be easier to anticipate.",
