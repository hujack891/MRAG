As you make your way along this road, you'll be intercepted by the last of the Lesser Yoaguais you need to complete your journal.\n## Mantis-Catching Swamp\nNow that you've cleaned up the majority of the optional bosses, it's time to find the last of the main bosses. You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis.\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Son of Stones\nLand behind the Sone of Stones on the cliff and then attack to start the fight. He won't immediately jump up, so you can get a couple of free hits in.\n\nYou'll need to ascend quite high up, but where the path reaches a dead end, up above there's an opening in the cliff that you can pass through. Follow this until you enter an area that's slightly covered and pass through this tunnel.",

The image serves to illustrate the path players must follow to reach the area where they will encounter the Son of Stones boss in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\""
