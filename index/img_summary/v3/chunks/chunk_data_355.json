    "img_summary": "The image depicts the Brown-Iron Cart, a formidable Yaoguai Chief boss in the game Black Myth: Wukong. The cart is situated in a dark, rocky environment with twisted trees and ancient structures, blocking the pathway from the Ashen Pass to the Camp of Seasons. This boss fight occurs at the start of Chapter 5 and is one of the Five Element Carts players must defeat. The guide suggests approaching the cart from behind via a small path to gain an advantage, avoiding direct fire attacks and focusing on hitting it when the fire dies down."
