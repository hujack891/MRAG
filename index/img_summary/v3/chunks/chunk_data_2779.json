Continue straight up from the Keeper's Shrine and into the clearing that's adorned by chains.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Supreme Inspector\n\nIn the first portion of the fight, the Supreme Inspector will perform a combo of melee attacks using the sword, often followed by a grab from its feet. Alternatively, he will fly close to the ground and quickly charge toward you. You'll also see The Supreme Inspector rise up from the ground, twirl around, and send out shockwaves in multiple directions. You can move from side to side to avoid these or dodge out of the way.\n\nAround the halfway mark the Supreme Inspector will switch up attacks and they'll become more aggressive. The combos will become longer, but you'll see the same moveset from the first section.",
