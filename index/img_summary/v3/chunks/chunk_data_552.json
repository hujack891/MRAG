As with previous Secret Areas, this one has its own separate shop where you can purchase things not found in the rest of the Webbed Hollow, which can help you toward crafting better weapons and armor:\nPurple Cloud Mountain Shrine Shop\n---\nTiger Subduing Pellets (x3) - 360 Will | Antimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will | |\nCold Iron Leaves (x2) - 900 Will | Fine Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will | Refined Iron Sand (x4) - 1200 Will | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Will\nGentian (x5) - 90 Will | Tree Pearl (x3) - 180 Will | Jade Lotus (x3) - 90 Will | Snake-Head Mushroom (x3) - 120 Will\n\nWatch for a Dragonfly Guai hiding in a left alcove as you move further up the path, and you'll find a large archway gate guarded by an empowered Snake Herbalist. Before charging in, you may notice a sloping path to the left of the gate where an archer waits, but there's another path just to the right across from where the Dragonfly Guai was.\n\nThis leads up to yet another Dragonfly Guai archer overlooking the gate who will ambush you if you try to attack the snake or his other archer friend.",
