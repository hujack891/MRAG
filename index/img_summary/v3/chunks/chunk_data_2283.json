The image likely illustrates the player's journey through the cell tunnel mentioned in the preceding text, where they are approaching a Red-Haired Yaksha guarding a green Wisp, which is crucial for replenishing the healing gourd. The visual aids in understanding the environment and challenges faced at this stage of the game."
