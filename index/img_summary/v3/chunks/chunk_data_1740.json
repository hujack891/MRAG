Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.\n\nThe good news is this attack is so powerful it will leave her incredibly drained, and give you plenty of time to retaliate with all your saved up focus points, a Spirit Attack, and anything else you can throw at her!",

It shows a character, likely the protagonist, crouching in front of a massive, ornate cymbal embedded in the ground, which plays a crucial role in the narrative. The cymbal is significant because defeating Kang-Jin Star will cause her to crash into it, freeing Zhu Bajie from imprisonment. The image visually represents the climactic moment of the battle, emphasizing the importance of the cymbals in the storyline."
