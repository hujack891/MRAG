It is one of the most powerful Transformations you can find within the game's early chapters, thanks to its extremely strong heavy attacks.\nThe Spell allows you to transform into a wolf guai and inflict Scorch Bane on the enemy with each attack. Red Tides' moveset is as follows:\n* **Light Attack: Moon Dance - Continuously slash at the enemy building up Focus.** This is a fast flurry of swings with Red Tides' blade that can stun-lock an enemy and catch them off guard from behind.\n## Black Myth: Wukong Red Tides Location\nRed Tides can be obtained by defeating Guangzhi in Forest of Wolves - Outside the Forest area in Black Wind Mountain. He is located at the far back, past the small bridge in the forest.\nThis is an optional boss, and with him being accessible so early in the game, you may struggle.
