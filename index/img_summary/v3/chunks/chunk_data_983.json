    "img_summary": "The image depicts a desolate, misty landscape with a cobblestone path leading towards a barren, tree-filled area. A character stands on the path, facing a glowing blue spirit. This scene likely represents the aftermath of the Father of Stones boss fight in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" where the player has just defeated the boss and is about to collect the Father of Stones Spirit, as described in the guide. The setting emphasizes the eerie and challenging environment of the Heights of Ember in Chapter 5."
