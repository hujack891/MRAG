    "img_summary": "The image depicts a creature resembling a large, armored frog-like being with a rugged, stone-like texture. It is positioned in a rocky, barren landscape, possibly part of the Rhino Watch Slope area in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" This creature is likely the Yaoguai Chief named Lang-Baw-Baw, as referenced in the walkthrough section of the document. The context suggests that players need to strategically attack this creature when its body turns red, indicating vulnerability. The image serves to visually represent this boss encounter, providing players with a glimpse of what to expect during this segment of the game."
