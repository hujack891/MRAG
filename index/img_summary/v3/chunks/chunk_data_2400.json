You can expect the same moveset and should prepare for them in the same way. If you're not using a general build, be sure to equip gear, curios, and spirits that give you Poison Resistance. Though this is another boss with a limited moveset, it can be easy to die to the Poison Chiefs if you're not careful.\n\nJust like stone bosses and the flint bosses from Chapter 5, most of the attacks from the Poison Chief will be charges and slams. It will try to use the weight of its body to attack while delivering smatterings of poison around the area.\n\nIts charges can be avoided, by dashing out of the way just before it reaches you.

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a battle scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showcasing a Poison Chief, a large, rocky Yaoguai creature covered in moss and vegetation, standing in a lush, forested area surrounded by cliffs. In the foreground, a player character wielding a staff prepares to engage the Poison Chief. This visual aligns with the preceding text, which describes Poison Chief fights in Chapter 6, emphasizing their charge-and-slam attacks and the importance of poison resistance. The image serves to illustrate the environment and the scale of the boss encounter detailed in the guide."
