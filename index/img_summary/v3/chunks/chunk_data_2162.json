Unlike other enemies, he won't use any magic or ranged tricks on you, and trades it all in for overwhelming power and a mastery of martial arts that makes him an extremely challenging foe -- and that's before the restraints come off.\nIf you haven't made use of them in other fights, now is definitely the time to take advantage of all the medicinal pills and consumable buffs you can craft and use. Items like the Tiger Subduing Pellets to raise your attack and others that can raise your stamina or focus can all help out greatly, and you'll want every advantage on your side.\n\nWhen using his fists, he'll often employ a three hit combo starting with an overhand swing with his right fist, and then a quick straight punch with his left, before expelling energy by opening his left palm for one last strike.\n\nAny time any of his limbs glow, you'll need to be extremely careful, as getting hit can take off a huge chunk of your life (making consumables that raise your max health even more important!)",
