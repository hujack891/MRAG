    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the section titled \"Webbed Hollow - Middle Hollow Walkthrough.\" It shows a player character in a narrow cave corridor facing a large, menacing creature known as \"Buddha's Right Hand.\" The creature appears to be a miniboss with a long, disturbing arm, and the player is preparing to engage in combat. The context suggests that this fight is unorthodox and requires strategic dodging and targeting of multiple weak points on the creature."
