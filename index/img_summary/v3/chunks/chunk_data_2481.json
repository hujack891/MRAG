    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image displays a detailed in-game menu screen showcasing the \"Wind Bear Staff,\" a rare weapon in the game. The weapon has an attack stat of 50 and a critical hit chance of 4%, with a unique effect that significantly increases the critical hit chance of the \"Unveiling Strike of Cloud Step.\" The crafting requirements include materials such as Flame Ebongold, Yaoguai Core, and Stone Spirit, alongside a currency labeled \"Will.\" The player's inventory and stats are visible on the right, along with a poetic description of the weapon: \"Where'er it goes, or steps may lead, Beasts quake in fear, and evils recede.\"\n\n2. **Purpose and Narrative Role**:  \nThe image serves as part of the walkthrough for \"Sandgate Village\" in Chapter 2 of *Black Myth: Wukong*. It highlights the importance of weapon upgrades and crafting at Keeper's Shrines or blacksmiths, which are introduced in the \"Village Entrance\" section. This ties into the preceding text's focus on exploring new shrine features, acquiring items, and preparing for upcoming challenges in the game."
