    "img_summary": "The image depicts Zhu Bajie, a boss character in *Black Myth: Wukong*, during the second encounter in the Webbed Hollow area. His menacing appearance, with glowing red eyes and dark, beast-like features, emphasizes his bewitched state under the influence of the Crimson Spider. The setting is a gloomy, eerie environment with twisted trees and a foggy atmosphere, reinforcing the difficulty and tension of the fight. The playerâ€™s interface is visible, showing health bars, abilities, and Zhu Bajie's name, indicating an active combat scenario. This image aligns with the guide's description of Zhu Bajie's challenging moves and the importance of strategic dodging and counterattacks."
