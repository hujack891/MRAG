The setting is a traditional courtyard adorned with cherry blossoms, where the player character, Wukong, is engaged in combat with Zhu Bajie, who wields a large 9-pointed rake. The scene is filled with dynamic effects, including debris, sparks, and petals, emphasizing the intensity of the battle. Zhu Bajie, now bewitched, appears aggressive and taunts the player with dialogue: \"Darn it! Did you see all of that? You think I'm a bad joke, don't you?\" The fight is part of Chapter 4 in the Webbed Hollow, where players must defeat Zhu Bajie to progress the story and earn rewards."
