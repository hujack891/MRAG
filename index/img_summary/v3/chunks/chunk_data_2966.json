    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" showing a character approaching a mystical shrine in a rocky environment. This visual supports the section titled \"1. Keepers Shrines Will Keep Expanding\" from the document \"Things Black Myth Wukong Doesn't Tell You.\" The preceding text explains that defeating certain bosses and obtaining unique Crafting Materials can unlock new recipes at these shrines, which can be used for crafting Gear, Weapons, and later, Medicines. The image likely illustrates the in-game shrine where players can access these new crafting options."
