    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth Wukong,\" specifically from the \"Man-in-Stone Questline\" in Chapter 2. It shows the protagonist interacting with a mystical, stone-like structure, likely related to the \"Yaoguai Chief Miniboss - Mother of Stone\" section. The context indicates that after defeating the Man-in-Stone, the player can obtain the Azure Dust Transformation Spell, which grants powerful but slow abilities. The image serves to illustrate a key moment in the questline where the player engages with the Man-in-Stone character or related elements."
