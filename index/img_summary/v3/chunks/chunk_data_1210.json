    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from \"The Forest of Wolves\" walkthrough, specifically from the section titled \"Outside the Forest.\" It shows a character approaching a waterfall, with statues of Buddha on either side, suggesting a serene yet potentially dangerous area. The character appears to be preparing for a confrontation, possibly with the figure standing in the water ahead. This setting aligns with the preceding text, which describes the challenges and encounters awaiting players as they leave the Shrine and venture into new areas, including the need for strategic positioning and readiness for tough battles."
