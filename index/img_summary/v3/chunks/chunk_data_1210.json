    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the section \"Outside the Forest\" in the document titled \"The Forest of Wolves.\" It shows a character in a forested area, seemingly engaged in combat with a creature labeled \"Wandering Wight.\" The character appears to be preparing to face the creature, which is accompanied by a larger, menacing figure in the background. This visual likely represents a challenging encounter the player must navigate after leaving the Shrine, as described in the preceding text. The image serves to illustrate the dangers and adversaries that await in the next area of the narrative."
