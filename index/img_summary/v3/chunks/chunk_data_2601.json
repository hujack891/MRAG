    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense battle scene inside a dark, rocky cave. A large, fiery creature with glowing flames on its body, resembling the Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast mentioned in the metadata, is engaged in combat with a smaller, armed figure wielding a staff-like weapon. The environment features molten lava flows and carved stone faces on the cave walls, emphasizing the ominous and dangerous atmosphere. This visual aligns with the context of secret bosses in Chapter 5, specifically the Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast, encountered in Bishui Cave near the Purge Pit Keeper's Shrine."
