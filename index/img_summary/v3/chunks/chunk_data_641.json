    "img_summary": "The image depicts a menacing creature, likely the Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast, crouching in a dark, icy environment. This scene aligns with the walkthrough for Chapter 5 of \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically within the Bishui Cave. The beast appears to be preparing for an encounter, fitting the description of the Yaoguai King in the \"Yaoguai King - Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast\" section of the guide. The preceding text mentions navigating through a frozen room with a fire-blocked doorway, suggesting the image captures a critical moment before facing the boss."
