Thankfully this will only lower your maximum health by around a fourth, and still give you a damage boost in return. The effect doesn't last forever -- only for around a full minute -- so make the most of it!",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark and atmospheric scene from a boss fight in a game, specifically against \"Captain Wise-Voice,\" as indicated by the health bar at the bottom. The glowing, golden entity surrounded by twisted, tree-like structures appears to represent the boss or its manifestation. The player character is visible in the foreground, engaging in combat. The preceding text explains the boss's \"beguiling chant\" ability, which temporarily reduces maximum health while granting a damage boost, suggesting the image showcases this intense phase of the fight."
