You'll also be much stronger since the last time you met, so this fight may not even take a long.\n\nWhen you're ready and all rested up, head up into the Temple to follow the sounds of someone fighting. What you'll encounter inside seems to be a pretty one-sided fight, as the Macaque Chief you battled previously is trying in vain to get at the Wise Master you upgraded your Gourd. The Macaque seems unable to reach the man through the ring of fire that's been erected, so it'll be your job to teach this boss another lesson.",
