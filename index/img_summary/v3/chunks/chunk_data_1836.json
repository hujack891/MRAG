The \"Gather\" prompt suggests the player can interact with the vine to collect it, which is significant for increasing the number of health-restoring Gourd uses. This location is part of the guide titled \"Luojia Fragrant Vine Locations,\" under the section \"Black Wind Mountain Luojia Fragrant Vines.\" The vine is a collectible item that enhances gameplay by improving health recovery options."
