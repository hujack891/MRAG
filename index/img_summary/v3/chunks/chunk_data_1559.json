A character in ornate armor stands near a shrine-like structure, while a red arrow points toward a staircase leading deeper into the cave. This visual likely serves as a guide for players to locate the **Skandha of Choice**, which is mentioned in the preceding text as being found in Chapter 4 at \"The Webbed Hollow, The Purifying Spring.\" The arrow emphasizes the path players need to follow to progress in their search for this key item."
