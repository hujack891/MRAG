That said, he does hit harder and can empower certain moves, so don’t assume this will be a cakewalk. You’ll want to have upgraded your staff after defeating the Whiteclad Noble to dish out more damage, and using the Wandering Wight’s Spirit on this guy can help tremendously.\n\nSo long as you deny him opportunities to restore his health, and watch out for when his followers are activated, you only need to keep up the assault and shut down his ground slams or stay far away when they happen.

A character holding a staff stands near a staircase surrounded by dense foliage and eerie lighting. In the background, a spectral or magical entity appears to be dissipating or materializing near a barren tree, suggesting a mystical or combat-related moment. This visual aligns with the context of the Yaoguai King Boss Battle against Elder Jinchi, emphasizing the game's supernatural and challenging elements."
