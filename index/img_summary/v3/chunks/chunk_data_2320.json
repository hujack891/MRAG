    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy, rocky path within a gorge, featuring a character holding a staff, likely navigating through the area. The path is lined with traditional pagoda-style lanterns, and a red arrow points towards a side path or hidden area on the right. This scene aligns with the \"Outside the Wheel\" section of the document \"The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm,\" suggesting that the image illustrates a key moment in the journey where the character must explore branching paths and gather resources like the Luojia Fragrant Vine. The image serves to visually guide the reader through this part of the walkthrough, emphasizing exploration and discovery."
