A solitary figure, possibly Daoist Mi, stands near the entrance, adding a mystical and contemplative atmosphere. This setting aligns with the narrative in Chapter 4, \"Secrets,\" specifically the section titled \"Daoist Mi and the Snake Lady - Purple Cloud Mountain,\" suggesting a significant location in the story where encounters and events unfold."
