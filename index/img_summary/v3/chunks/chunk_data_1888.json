    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game Black Myth Wukong, specifically related to the quest for the Mad Tiger miniboss. It shows a character holding a rattle-drum, which is a key item used to follow the trail of a ghostly boy leading to the Mad Tiger. The setting appears to be a desolate area with rocky terrain and sparse vegetation, possibly near the Windrest Hamlet Shrine, as described in the context. This image serves to illustrate the journey to find the Mad Tiger, an optional secret boss in Chapter 2 of the game."
