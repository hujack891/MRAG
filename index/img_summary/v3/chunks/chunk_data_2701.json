    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy outdoor setting viewed from inside a building, with an arrow indicating a pathway leading across a wooden bridge. This aligns with the instructions in the \"Returning to Fox Form\" sub-section of the \"Snow Fox Questline,\" where players are guided to navigate through specific areas to progress in the quest. The visual serves as a directional aid for players to locate the next step in the questline."
