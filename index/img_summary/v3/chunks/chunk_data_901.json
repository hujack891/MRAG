He’s fairly formidable in his own right, and you’ll need to learn his attacks to win the duel. The Yellow-Robed Squire is a big fan of hurling dust clouds in your direction to mask his movements, and you’ll need to be even more reactive than usual to make sure you don’t get blindsided.\n\nOther times, his third attack will have him extend his clawed hand back and charge up, before performing a dashing impaling thrust attack that covers a lot of ground quickly, so be ready to react when he lunges at you.",
