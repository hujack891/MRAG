He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).\nAs mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses.\n\nThe attack won't stop there, as once he re-burrows, you'll need to keep your eyes and ears peeled. After a brief moment, his electrified sword will come hurtling in from a corner of the arena with a small lightning strike noise, and you'll need to dodge it as it embeds itself in the ground. Stay clear of the impact site, as the boss will then burrow out to grab it and perform a quick double slash with the electrified blade before spinning about (at which you should then hop in and attack).",
