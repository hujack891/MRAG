    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the boss fight against the Cloudtreading Deer in Chapter 6. The deer, a significant Yaoguai Chief, is shown in a dynamic moment, possibly during an attack or after landing, surrounded by a dark, possibly poisonous or frost-affected area. The player character appears to be preparing to engage or dodge the deer's attack. This visual supports the guide's advice on maintaining distance from the deer's tornadoes and timing attacks after its landing."
