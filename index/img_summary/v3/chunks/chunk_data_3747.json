This boss has a speciality - and it’s creating blood. Lots of it. This blood can be pretty dangerous too, as he’ll be able to create pools of it all around the arena, and even poison you with it, so make sure you’re stocked on a few antimiasma pills.\n\nOn the other side, you can spy the path leading back up to where the Xu Dog crafts medicines under the Crouching Tiger Temple on the far side of this area.",
