    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from Chapter 4, set in the Village of Lanxi. The player character is seen approaching a building in a dark, forested area, with a red circle highlighting a point of interest near the entrance. This scene likely follows the miniboss fight against the Second Sister, a giant venomous spider, as described in the \"Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - The Second Sister\" section of the walkthrough. The image serves to illustrate the environment and possibly guide the player on where to go next after the battle."
