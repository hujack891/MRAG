The object is encircled with a red dashed line, indicating its significance. This scene is from the \"Field of Fire Walkthrough\" under the section \"Ashen Pass III\" and sub-section \"Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai.\" The image likely serves to guide players to a specific location or item related to the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai boss fight. The preceding text mentions collecting the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai Spirit after defeating the boss, suggesting the highlighted object could be this spirit or a related key item."
