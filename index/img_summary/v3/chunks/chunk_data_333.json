    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" showcasing a player character standing in a dimly lit cave-like environment. The character is holding a glowing staff and is positioned near a blue spirit, which is likely the Blade Monk Spirit mentioned in the text. The player has the option to \"Take\" the spirit, suggesting it can be absorbed to gain temporary powers. The image serves to illustrate the moment after defeating the Blade Monk, where the player can collect the spirit as part of the gameplay. The metadata and context indicate this is part of a guide on locating and interacting with the Blade Monk Spirit."
