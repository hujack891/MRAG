The first is Elder Jinchi and the second is Red Loong. There are also Transformation Spells and missable Spirits that you'll want to bag before you wrap up the chapter.\n## Secret: Ancient Guanyin Temple - Elder Jinchi and the Fireproof Mantle\n\nThe Wandering Wight boss isn't a secret, but the **Wandering Wight Spirit is missable** and that's not made clear. You'll need to pass the Wandering Wight to get out of the Forest of Wolves and onto the next part of Chapter 1 - Black Cloud, Red Fire, but it can be tempting to leave the challenging fight until the end and return to it later. Whatever you do, **beat him before you unlock the secret area in Chapter 1 that requires ringing the bells.**\n\nTo be clear, if you defeat him on your first encounter with him, you won't be able to collect his spirit until you've got the Gourd further on in the chapter. But if you don't defeat him before ringing the bells and unlocking the secret area in Chapter 1, you'll miss him entirely!",
