    "img_summary": "The image depicts a rugged, ancient landscape with dilapidated structures and a pathway leading to a large, fortified gate. In the foreground, a character appears to be in motion, possibly engaging in combat or exploration, while another figure, resembling a boar, stands further back. This scene aligns with the context provided in the document titled \"Fuban,\" specifically in the section \"Where to Find Fuban,\" which describes a secret area in the Kingdom of Sahali from the game Black Myth Wukong. The image likely illustrates the setting where players can encounter the Drunken Boar and progress in their quest to find Fuban."
