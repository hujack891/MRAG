    "img_summary": "The image depicts a lush, green landscape with cliffs, trees, and a grassy clearing, likely part of the environment in *Black Myth: Wukong*. A character, possibly the player-controlled protagonist, is seen hovering on a cloud-like platform, holding a weapon and surveying the area. This scene aligns with the \"How to Find Poison Chief 1\" section, suggesting the image serves as a visual guide to help players locate the Poison Chief by showing the terrain and landmarks near the described area."
