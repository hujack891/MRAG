    "img_summary": "The image depicts a gameplay scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, specifically during the miniboss fight against the Centipede Guai in the Middle Hollow area of the Webbed Hollow. The player character is engaged in combat within a dark, cavernous arena littered with bones and debris. Several smaller centipedes are rolling toward the player, emitting greenish toxic effects, emphasizing the need for anti-poison items as mentioned in the walkthrough. The health bar labeled \"Centipede Guai\" suggests the ongoing battle against this challenging boss. The setting aligns with the guide's description of a hazardous, multi-front encounter requiring strategic preparation."
