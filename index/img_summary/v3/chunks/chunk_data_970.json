    "img_above_text": "# Essential Tips and Tricks\nBlack Myth: Wukong is a challenging action game with some RPG elements, and whether you consider yourself a combat expert or not, there's a lot of essential tips and tricks to learn as you follow in the footsteps of Sun Wukong. Below you'll find important tips for both exploration and combat to start you on the right foot.\n* **Jump to:**\n* **General Tips**\n* **Combat Tips**\n* Exploration Tips**\n## General Tips\n\n* **Upgrade and customize your gourd.** Your healing gourd can have a lot of customization the deeper you get into your adventure. You'll be able to find different Gourds that can have a certain amount of use or extra effect, Drinks that can heal you all at once or over time, and Soaks that provide additional effects along with the health boost. Try tailoring the Soak or Drink to your current challenge: a higher health boost at the cost of healing over time is better when exploring versus going against a fast-paced boss, and certain soaks may allow you to gain resistance to a certain enemy attack.\n\n* **Once your Gourd has been upgraded to absorb Spirits, you can also gain an additional benefit: Absorbing Green Wisps**. Not only does this get you Will, but replenishes an additional use for your Gourd. If you defeat a tough enemy or Miniboss that leaves behind its Spirit, you'll replenish your entire Gourd once it's claimed!\n\n* **Not every enemy respawns when you rest at a Shrine.** Certain unique enemies or encounters, or those who grant a Spirit when killed won't respawn. The same goes for very tough enemies like the Bandit Chief in the Forest of Wolves, and the Wolf Assassins in the Black Wind Cave.",

It highlights the \"Guangmou\" spirit, classified as \"Epic,\" with details on its Qi cost, upgraded effect (reducing Qi cost for the skill), and equipped effect (moderately increasing poison damage and resistance). The interface allows players to sort spirits by rarity and cultivate them using Will points. This screen is likely part of the general tips section, emphasizing the importance of upgrading and customizing abilities to enhance gameplay."
