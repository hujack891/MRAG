    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, mountainous landscape under a cloudy sky, with a large, insect-like creature perched on a rock formation. This scene is part of the \"Verdant Path\" section in the \"Foothills Walkthrough\" of the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" The creature shown is likely the Yaoguai Chief known as Feng-Tail General, encountered after defeating the Poison Chief and flying towards the water area. The image serves to illustrate the dramatic and eerie environment players will navigate during this part of the game."
