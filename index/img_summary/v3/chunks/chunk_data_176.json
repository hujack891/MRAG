You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive. You should also have the Loongwreathe or Kang-Jin Staff, and have a good set of spells equipped that compliment your attacks -- we reccomend Immobilize and Rock Solid, but you can also try using the Ring of Fire to buff yourself up in since the arena is small.\nThe Cyan Loong doesn't have a huge amount of attacks, but when they hit, they hit hard!\n\nWith his freshly empowered sword, Cyan Loong will deal more damage than ever before. A single sword swing can cleave your health apart, and if you already have the shock status effect, you can easily die in a single hit if you aren't careful.
