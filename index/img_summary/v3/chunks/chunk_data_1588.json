It depicts the player character standing near a small shrine-like structure in a bamboo forest, with a lit brazier nearby. A red arrow points toward a staircase leading further into the forest, suggesting the location of the second bell (**Bell 2**) as part of the puzzle. The image serves as a visual guide to help players navigate and locate the next step in solving the puzzle."
