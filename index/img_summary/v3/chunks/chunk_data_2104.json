Taking double damage from any of his attacks is highly inadvisable, so make sure your Shock-Quelling Powder is on your quickbar for this fight.\nYellowbrow chiefly attacks with a large spiked mace while he holds his magic seedbag in the other hand. Be incredibly wary of his weapon, as it has the ability to change its shape, and he can extend the handle at will both in size, length, and flexibility.\n\nExpect him to follow up this attack be retracting it, and then slamming it over his head down in front of him with another ranged mid-range attack.\n\nThese two attacks have a lot of weight to them, and leave him with considerable openings to get in plenty of hits while he retracts his weapon and resets his posture, so make the most of them!",
