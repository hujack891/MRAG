The Yellow Wind Sage has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, and is not only a deadly attacker, but a master of the Samadhi Winds — but more on that later.\nMake sure you're suitably prepared for the fight in the best ways possible: Craft a bunch of medicine to increase your damage absorption and max health, and allocate any Mind Cores you’ve found toward Celestial Medicine buffs. You should also have a full set of either the Galeguard or Insect armor fully crafted, as well as the Cloud-Patterened Stone Staff from defeating the optional Sihandang boss. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you’ve beaten the Chapter 2 Secret Boss and equipped the new Vessel, the Wind Tamer.\n\nHe’ll use most of his original attacks from this point on, though many are imbued with more powerful slashes, and he can continue to summon sand phantoms to stomp down on you even if you’ve dispelled the storm.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a gameplay moment from the boss fight against the Yellow Wind Sage in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The player character is shown mid-battle, wielding a weapon while facing the hulking rat-like boss, who is attacking with a fiery trident spear. The environment is a barren, sandy battlefield, emphasizing the intense and challenging nature of the encounter. The health bar at the bottom indicates the boss's remaining health, while the UI displays player abilities and resources. This visual aligns with the guide's description of the Yellow Wind Sage as a formidable foe with powerful attacks and mastery of wind-based abilities."
