If you think this may limit his moves, you’re unfortunately in for a rude awakening. The Yellow Wind Sage has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, and is not only a deadly attacker, but a master of the Samadhi Winds — but more on that later.\nMake sure you're suitably prepared for the fight in the best ways possible: Craft a bunch of medicine to increase your damage absorption and max health, and allocate any Mind Cores you’ve found toward Celestial Medicine buffs. You should also have a full set of either the Galeguard or Insect armor fully crafted, as well as the Cloud-Patterened Stone Staff from defeating the optional Sihandang boss. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you’ve beaten the Chapter 2 Secret Boss and equipped the new Vessel, the Wind Tamer.\n\nHe can also do a very quick jab with the butt of his trident that comes after the end of the weapon glows for a moment, and he’ll soon follow it with a stomp that’ll be hard to dodge if staggered by the first attack. If you spot the other end of his spear glowing, you should have enough time to parry it with Rock Solid when he jabs, and interrupt his follow up attack!",
