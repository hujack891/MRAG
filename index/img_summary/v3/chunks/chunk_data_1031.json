    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, cavernous area with towering, ornate structures partially illuminated by beams of light. This setting aligns with the \"Cooling Slope\" section of the \"Field of Fire Walkthrough\" in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" The image likely represents the environment encountered after defeating the Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart, where players receive the Flame Orb Curio and proceed to a frozen-over entrance leading to the Bishui Cave, a secret area in the chapter."
