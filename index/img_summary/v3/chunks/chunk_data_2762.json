    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game *Black Myth: Wukong*, specifically the boss fight against the **Stone Vanguard** in the Fright Cliff area during Chapter 2. The foreground shows the protagonist, armed with a staff, facing off against the massive rock-like Yaoguai King, the Stone Vanguard. The setting features a desolate, rocky environment with dry grass and a twisted tree, emphasizing the ominous atmosphere of the encounter. This visual aligns with the guide's description of the boss's imposing presence and challenging attacks, as well as hints at strategic gameplay elements like evasion and assistance from the Shigandang."
