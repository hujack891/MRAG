This boss has a speciality - and it’s creating blood. Lots of it. This blood can be pretty dangerous too, as he’ll be able to create pools of it all around the arena, and even poison you with it, so make sure you’re stocked on a few antimiasma pills.\n\nDefeating him will earn you his Gore-Eye Daoist Spirit to absorb, and you can also help yourself to the second Luojia Fragrant Vine in this chapter to boost your gourd yet again!\n\nGore-Eye Daoist\n\nBeyond a Lingzhiling hiding in the corner of this area, there’s not much else, so with the miniboss defeated you can find a path heading down past a green Wisp to absorb, leading you back to the Windseal Gate. This is the same spot you slid down to after defeating the Stone Vanguard, and gained the Pluck of Many spell, and can now open the gate with the Sterness of Stone and Keeness of Tiger.",
