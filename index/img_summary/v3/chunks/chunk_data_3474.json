From some reason it will be daylight when you return, and nearly all the enemies will be gone, save for a Lantern Holder that opened the door for you where you fought the Second Sister. Defeat this lone foe, and you'll be able to claim the Lantern Holder Spirit!\n\nThe Upper Hollow area consists of a small group of houses to the left, and a larger pathway to the right that rings around the level, providing multiple points to drop down to the lower level. The main path rings around to the right of the shrine, so we'll check out the other side first.",
