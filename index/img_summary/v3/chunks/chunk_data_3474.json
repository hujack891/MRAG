The player character, Wukong, is positioned in a dimly lit underground cave, preparing to confront a Dragonfly Guai enemy perched on a ledge. The environment is marked by webbed surfaces, stone platforms, and lit braziers, emphasizing the eerie and hostile atmosphere. The red-dotted circle highlights the enemy's location, aligning with the walkthrough's advice to prioritize defeating the Dragonfly Guai due to its poison attacks. This visual serves to illustrate the strategic challenge described in the guide."
