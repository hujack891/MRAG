    "img_summary": "The image displays the \"Non-Able Spirit\" section from the game Black Myth: Wukong. It shows the in-game menu where players can equip the Non-Able Spirit, which is classified as an Epic item with a low Qi cost. The Spirit grants the \"Seasoned Punch\" ability, allowing players to take the form of Non-Able and perform a series of punches and kicks. The equipped effect increases Attack, Critical Hit Chance, and Critical Damage but significantly reduces Maximum Mana, making it a situational choice depending on the player's reliance on magic."
