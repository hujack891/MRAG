This setting is likely part of the Purple Cloud Mountain secret area in Chapter 4 of Black Myth: Wukong, where players encounter hidden bosses. The character in the image may be the Scorpionlord, who initiates a fight when his pots are smashed. The image serves to illustrate the environment and key elements related to the secret boss encounter described in the section titled \"Daoist Mi\" from the document \"Secret Bosses in Chapter 4.\""
