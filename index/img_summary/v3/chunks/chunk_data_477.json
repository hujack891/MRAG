Below you'll find a guide to accessing the temple with all three bell locations, and how to defeat the secret Yaoguai King boss, Elder Jinchi.\nThis Chapter 1 Secret can only be accessed by ringing three large bells found around Black Wind Mountain, and will transport you to a different location to fight the secret boss that possess a magical item that is instrumental in defeating the Black Wind King.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Battle - Elder Jinchi\nIf you fought the Wandering Wight then the good news is you’ll have a good idea of what to expect in this fight, as he shares many of the same moves. That said, he does hit harder and can empower certain moves, so don’t assume this will be a cakewalk. You’ll want to have upgraded your staff after defeating the Whiteclad Noble to dish out more damage, and using the Wandering Wight’s Spirit on this guy can help tremendously.\n\nAfter losing a bit of his health, the Elder Jinchi will get mad, often proclaiming you’ve stolen some treasure from him, and command his followers to attack. Now, finally, the shambling bodies will finally become a threat, and begin to glow as they chase you.\n\nThe good news is they don’t move all that fast, and must stop for a moment before finally exploding. All you need to do is lead them on a merry chase, and zigzag around to cause them to begin to explode before dashing away. Once no more glowing zombies are near you, resume your fight against Jinchi.",
