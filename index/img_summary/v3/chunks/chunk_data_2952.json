    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic scene from the video game Black Myth: Wukong, specifically during the Stone Monkey boss fight in Chapter 6. It shows a character, likely the player, standing in a watery environment at sunset, facing the Stone Monkey, who is emerging from the water. This visual aligns with the guide's description of the Stone Monkey's tactics in Phase One, where he disappears and reappears to catch the player off guard. The ripples in the water serve as a clue to the Stone Monkey's movements, emphasizing the strategic element of the battle."
