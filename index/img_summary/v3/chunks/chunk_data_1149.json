    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from Chapter 6, set in the Deer Sight Forest section of the Foothills Walkthrough. It shows a character, likely the player, encountering the Water-Wood Beast, a Yaoguai Chief, in a forested area with a body of water. The beast appears to be a large, tree-like creature partially submerged in water, with branches and foliage. This encounter is part of the walkthrough instructions for defeating the Water-Wood Beast, where players are advised to use strong attacks after the beast douses itself off with water."
