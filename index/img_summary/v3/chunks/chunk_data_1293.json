Below you'll find a guide for the Fright Cliff Region and its side quests for the Man-in-Stone and Yellow-Robed Squire, as well as how to defeat its many bosses that include the Mother of Stones and Stone Vanguard to get the Sterness of Stone.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Squall Hideout**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Stones\n* **Rockrest Flat**\n* Yaoguai King - Stone Vanguard\n* **Rock Crash Platform**\n## Rock Clash Platform\n\nYou can also try transforming into the Rock Guai yourself with the Azure Dust. Just remember that you only build Might by getting hit, and the slow pace of his attacks may make that hard unless he’s going for his more rapid arm stamping attack. If you do get a full Might bar, you can unleash a devastating “Rockfall” attack that will take off a good deal of this bosses health bar!\n\nDefeating the Stone Vanguard will reward you with the Sterness of Stone, one half of the items you need to activate the tallies that unlock the large door to the chapter’s main boss.\n\nStone Vanguard\n\nNote - This arena is actually home to more than one boss, and it’s hiding in plain sight. Near the entrance you came in through the large archway, there’s a large stone on the side, and on closer inspection has many heads carved into it. Draw close, and you’ll be able to interact with it, inserting the six Buddha Eyeballs you gained from the statue heads around the Fright Cliff. Doing so will unlock the Shigandang secret boss battle. It’s a much tougher fight than the Stone Vanguard, and we recommend saving it for the tail end of this chapter, either after you’ve cleared it or are close to doing so.",
