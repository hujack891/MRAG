The more they attack you on all sides with tiny blades, the faster you’ll charge your Might to unleash your big area of effect spell attack.\n\nOutside of your transformation, try to use Spirits who can attack multiple targets like the Earth Wolf’s charge, and consider using the Pillar Stance’s heavy attack to spin around on staff and attack the group as a whole.",
