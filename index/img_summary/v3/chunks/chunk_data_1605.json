When you've met these conditions, he returns to the area where you first found him. This time, however, he won't be sitting on the rock.\n\nFrom the Temple Entrance Keeper's Shrine, head up the stairs and take the turning on the right just before you reach the top. You'll see the Yellow-Robed Squire slouched against the wall. When you speak to him he'll ask you for a treat of a **Jade Lotus**. If you don't have any of these, look for areas where there's water. You just need one; when you have it, bring it back to him and he'll move on from the Crouching Tiger Temple.",

This visual likely corresponds to the section \"How to Find the Boar After the Crouching Tiger Temple\" in the guide *How to Unlock the Chapter 2 Secret Area*. The image illustrates a key moment in the questline involving the Yellow-Robed Squire (Drunken Boar NPC), emphasizing the challenging encounter players may face after progressing past the Crouching Tiger Temple."
