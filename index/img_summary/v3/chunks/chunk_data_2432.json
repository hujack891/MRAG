It is one of the most powerful Transformations you can find within the game's early chapters, thanks to its extremely strong heavy attacks.\nThe Spell allows you to transform into a wolf guai and inflict Scorch Bane on the enemy with each attack. Red Tides' moveset is as follows:\n* **Light Attack: Moon Dance - Continuously slash at the enemy building up Focus.** This is a fast flurry of swings with Red Tides' blade that can stun-lock an enemy and catch them off guard from behind.\n\n* **Heavy Attack: Moon Chase - Unleash a series of dash attacks.** This attack can be performed with or without focus to dash across an area, performing a potent strike as you do so.",
