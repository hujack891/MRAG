You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive. You should also have the Loongwreathe or Kang-Jin Staff, and have a good set of spells equipped that compliment your attacks -- we reccomend Immobilize and Rock Solid, but you can also try using the Ring of Fire to buff yourself up in since the arena is small.\nThe Cyan Loong doesn't have a huge amount of attacks, but when they hit, they hit hard!\n\nThe good news is his final sword slice allows for an extended moment to dodge around and attack him from behind. However, you'll need to keep your eyes open when trying to attack from behind, as he can easily whip his mace-like tail around to hit you. Watch for it to rise up to the top left before slashing down to the bottom right to know when to deflect or evade.",
