The Fox will tell you that a monk killed her, and now resides in the New Thunderclap Temple, but doesn't tell you exactly where.\n### Non-Void Miniboss Fight and Guide\nThe monk who killed the Fox Guai you encountered in the Forest of Felicity, Non-Void is one of the disciples of Yellowbrow, and has his own set of peculiar moves. While he doesn't deal elemental damage, he can be a hard target to pin down due to his ability to become non-corporeal, causing some of your attacks to pass right through him!\nThe key to defeating this foe is to learn his attacks, and more importantly learning which parts leave him vulnerable to counters, and when you won't able to hurt him. Whenever he becomes transparent, avoid using any moves like Immobilize as you'll just waste their cooldowns and mana.\n\nWhile it can be dodged, the paper tornado will constantly follow you, and Non-Void will use this opportunity to cast more projectiles at you. Luckily, you can actually utilize your Staff Spin to disperse the tornado. The moment you see the papers flutter back to the ground, resume your assault!\n\nWhen trying to press your attack against him, watch for one of his incorporeal evasions where he twirls around to the side of you. He'll often end this movement by preparing a large palm blast attack. Though he'll do so while still transparent, it can be deflected with Rock Solid, or evaded as he'll return to solid form after the attack ends.",
