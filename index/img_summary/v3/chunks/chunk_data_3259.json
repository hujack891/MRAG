    "img_summary": "The image depicts two characters in a bamboo forest setting, likely from the game \"Black Myth Wukong.\" The older character appears to be an Ancient Master, holding a scroll or object, possibly indicating a moment of guidance or instruction. This scene aligns with the context of meeting the Ancient Master in the Bamboo Grove to upgrade the Gourd, which is necessary for absorbing the Wandering Wight Spirit. The narrative role of the image is to illustrate the point in the game where the player receives crucial guidance to progress."
