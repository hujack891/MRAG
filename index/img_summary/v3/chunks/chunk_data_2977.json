    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" showing the main character exploring a desolate, rocky area with sparse vegetation and structures in the background. The context provided indicates that this section of the document, titled \"Things Black Myth Wukong Doesn't Tell You,\" specifically focuses on the tip \"It Pays to Backtrack.\" The preceding text explains that backtracking in the game can lead to encounters with enemies that have bright blue glowing outlines, which drop valuable spirits to aid in combat.
