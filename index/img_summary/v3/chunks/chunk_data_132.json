After unlocking the Gourd in Chapter 1, you can start to capture the spirits of enemies and use them in battle. But if you're searching for tips on what the best spirits to use are, here's what we'd recommend.\nLooking for information on every Spirit in the game and how to collect them? Visit our Spirit Locations page.\n## Best Spirits to Use in Black Myth: Wukong\nWhen you use a Spirit, you will temporarily transform into them and be able to perform their special move. Alongside these skills, each Spirit provides a boost to a general stat or status effect, such as an increase in Poison damage or an increase in Defense when performing a particular move like Rock Solid.\nUnlike Transformations, you will share the same health bar with Spirits, so it's crucial to pull them out at the right time. Not sure which Spirits to equip? Here are some we consider to be the best spirits to use in Black Myth: Wukong.\nWandering Wight| Guangmou| Tiger's Acolyte\n---|---|---\nBlade Monk| Non-White| Falcon Hermit\nClay Vajra| Flint Vanguard| Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang (Upgraded)\nRemember that Spirits can be upgraded! At any Keeper's Shrine, you can choose to Cultivate Spirits from the Self-Advance menu. This will allow you to upgrade your Spirits using a combination of Will and items like Blood of the Iron Bull and Tadpoles. If you like a Spirit, cultivate them so you can max out their buffs.\n### Clay Vajra\n\nNon-White's Bone Spikes attack allows him to leap forward and spin at the same time, getting close to targets quickly and hitting them. The immediate follow-up to this is he'll sprout thorns to stab an enemy, prolonging the attack. In the same way that Gangmou is useful for Poison Damage, so is the Non-White Spirit. Alongside the moderate buff to Poison Damage, you'll also get a moderate increase to Frost Damage, so aim for a two-pronged attack that allows you to inflict both elements.",
    "img_below_text": "If you've got to Chapter 3 and encountered a Clay Vajra, you'll know they're a walking fire machine, and who wouldn't want to use that as an attack? Flames of Doom will see the Clay Vajra shoot fire from its knees in a wide arc, meaning you can deal with groups or cover a large area when attacking. The buff you'll receive for having this Spirit equipped is burn resistance, so it's also great to use against enemies that deliver fire attacks themselves.",
