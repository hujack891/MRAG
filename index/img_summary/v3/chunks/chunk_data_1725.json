You can reach this boss by making your way through the Pagoda Realm and through the Temple of Warding and out the back to a large slope you can slide down onto Turtle Island.\n### Kang-Jin Star Boss Fight and Guide\nLike the other Kang-Jin, expect this fight to involve a heaping helping of electricity, and stock up accordingly on Shock-Quelling medicine, or you'll be taking a lot of damage. Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.\n\nWhen the battle starts, Kang-Jin Star will often summon small serpent-like electric projectiles to swim around her in the air before sending them your way. Watch her movement to see when she directs them so you'll know when to dodge their quick movement.\n\nThis boss doesn't move all that much, though she can teleport, meaning you'll be able to close the distance quite fast, but Kang-Jin Star will use a lot of spells to keep you at arms length.",
