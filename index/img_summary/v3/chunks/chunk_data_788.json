    "img_above_text": "# Crouching Tiger Temple Walkthrough\nThe Crouching Tiger Temple is one of two possible second main regions of Chapter 2 in the Yellow Wind Ridge of Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide for the Temple and its main boss fight against the Tiger Vanguard, as well as the secret Cellar beneath it once you have the Keeness of Tiger.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai King - Tiger Vanguard\n* **Temple Cellar**\nThe Crouching Tiger Temple is one of the two sub-regions you’ll need to explore in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong in order to unlock the large sealed doors that lead to the end of the chapter. You can first reach this area by heading through the Sandgate Village and defeating the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, taking the left path through the Valley of Despair and through a crack in the wall leading to a small canyon.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Tiger Vanguard\nCompared to the slow and measured slams of the Stone Vanguard, the Tiger Vanguard is a relentless beast of a foe. You’ll need to be well prepared to take him down, and make sure you have the best armor and weapons crafted. If you haven’t been using them much before, now is also an excellent time to invest in crafting consumable medicines. Items like the Evil Repelling Medicament to reduce incoming damage, and the Tiger Subduing Pellets to increase your own.\n\nThe last hit he’ll try to throw you off by spinning in place before the swing, so don’t be fooled! While there’s a chance he’ll perform a flourish and sheathe his sword after this, it’s more likely he’ll try to fool you again before starting up a second combo, which comes in three quick slashes with no delay at the end.\n\nIf you try to retreat from the second combo, be warned that he can slice the bloody water to form waves of force as projectile slices with three hits, so you’ll need to keep dodging either way.",
