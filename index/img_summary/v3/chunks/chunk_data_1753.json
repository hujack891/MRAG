Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.\n\nExpect her to get more aggressive in this second half, expelling more lightning at the end of some of her close-combat attacks that require more dodging and less room for counters. You can still use Immobilize to keep her from floating away, however.",
