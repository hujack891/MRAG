    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from \"The Forest of Wolves\" in the section titled \"Front Hills.\" It shows a character, likely the Destined One, crossing a wooden bridge in a forested area. The character appears to be in motion, possibly preparing for an encounter or navigating the terrain. The bridge leads to a path surrounded by dense trees and rocky terrain. The preceding text mentions encountering lesser Wolf Guais, a Swordsworn, and a Wolf Soldier in this area, suggesting that the image is set just before or during these encounters. The visual elements, including the forest and bridge, align with the narrative context of exploring and facing adversaries in the Front Hills."
