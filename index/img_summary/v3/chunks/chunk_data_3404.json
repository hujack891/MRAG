Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n* Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n* Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n## Yaoguai Queen Boss Fight - Violet Spider\nMuch like The Second Sister, this boss will take the form of a gigantic and fearsome spider, and uses attacks in a few similar ways. She can lash out with her appendages, which will subtly shift into long blades but also give you a clue as to where her main attacks will come from. As you might expect, you'll also have to deal with dodging both poison and webbing, making mobility key to your survival.\n\nThe good news is this phase doesn't last forever, but you will need to survive it for about 30 seconds, so you should also consider utilizing Immobilize to trap her in place, or even a Transformation Spell to offload the damage onto a different form.\n\nHer eyes will stop glowing after you've been mesmerized once, so once the room is back to normal, continue to dodge her projectiles and get your hits in after her violent stabs and slam attacks.\n\nWhen the queen of spiders finally falls to your assault, she'll beat a hasty retreat to return to wherever she's hidden the Sage's Relic. You'll need to follow quickly, because a literal spider army will appear to give chase!\n\nViolet Spider",
