As a required boss fight, you'll encounter them blocking the path leading out of the Sandgate Village, connecting to both the Fright Cliff and Crouching Tiger Temple.\n* Rewards: Pungent Flesh Chunk, Second Rat Prince Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Yaoguai Core x2, Silk x2, Stone Spirit x1, 1102 Experience, 1014 Will\n## King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\nThere’s one very important thing to get out of the way before discussing the rest of the fight. Despite the name, the Rat King of Flowing Sands is not your true target, and in reality you can complete this battle as soon as you defeat his son, the Second Rat Prince. However, if you choose to engage in regicide yourself, know that the prince will become enraged at the death of his father, and will gain a massive damage increase with empowered moves. But for all this risk, there is a reward — defeating the empowered Rat Prince will allow you to absorb his Spirit to use in attacks, which you **can’t gain otherwise**!\nWhen the battle begins, you’ll notice that the King wisely does not try to fight you up close. He’ll scurry behind his son and out of sight while the Second Rat Prince tries to hold your attention with massive swings from his spiked mace. The King can even burrow underground, creating a trail of flying dirt as he tries to evade you.\n\nThe easiest way to get the King to come down again is to simply lure the Second Prince over to one of the pillars. Let him strike at you wildly, and he’ll destroy the pillar and send the King toppling down to be hit. He doesn’t have much health, and has a hard time getting away, especially if you catch him some distance away from his son who can sometimes take his time closing the distance.",
