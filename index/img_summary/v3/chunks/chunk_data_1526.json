    "img_summary": "The image depicts the Shigandang boss from the game Black Myth Wukong, a formidable stone creature that can be summoned to defeat the Stone Vanguard boss in Chapter 2. Summoning Shigandang allows players to bypass the Stone Vanguard, earning experience and item rewards. However, Shigandang will turn hostile immediately after defeating the Stone Vanguard, presenting a new challenge for players. If defeated by Shigandang, players can reawaken at a nearby Shrine and summon it again, enabling further exploration of the Rock Crash Platform."
