    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically during the miniboss fight against Buddha's Right Hand in the Webbed Hollow area. The player character is in a narrow, rocky hallway facing a large, menacing hand attached to a long arm emerging from the darkness.
