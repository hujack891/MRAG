Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Ashen Pass III**\n* Boss Fight - Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n* **Cooling Slope**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n* Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n* Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang\n* Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\n* **Fallen Furnace Crater**\n* Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n* Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\nAfter defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the Yin-Yang Fish, and the Crimson-Silver Cart, you'll have climbed to the top of the Flaming Mountains and be closer to finding out where the Bull King is.\n## Ashen Pass III\n### Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n\nYou're about to get quite familiar with this ball, as it will follow you along the path for a while. It will roll back and forth over a small portion of the path each time, but if it hits you just once, it's game over.\n\nThe aim of this section is to find little alcoves or wider sections of the path, so you can dip into them and stay out of the ball's line of fire.\n\n**Here are some tips for completing this section:**\n\n* **Look for where the enemies are along the path.** Typically, this is where the path is wider or there's a place you can stop and wait.\n* **Watch where the ball is rolling to see where it starts and ends.** This changes as you make your way along the path, so it's always worth waiting for a second and seeing the length of the path the ball covers while it's rolling before you run.\n* **Use Cloudstep.** On the longer sections, where it seems like a mad dash to try and reach the next point, use Cloudstep to cover the ground quicker.\n* **Whenever you can, back enemies into the path of the ball.** They're not immune to the attacks, so it can make light work of them saving you the hassle.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, rocky path in a mountainous area with a large, spherical object partially visible in the background. An arrow indicates the direction of travel along the path. The scene is from the \"Ashen Pass III\" section of the \"Field of Fire Walkthrough\" for the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" This section involves navigating a path while avoiding a rolling ball that can cause instant defeat if it hits the player. The image serves to illustrate the challenging terrain and the presence of the rolling ball hazard, providing visual context for the tips and strategies outlined in the walkthrough."
