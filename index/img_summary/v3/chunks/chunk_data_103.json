However, you'll soon find that poison isn't the only new thing that this particular boss brings to the table. Still, having Antimiasma Pills can be essential to your survival, due to the ability for you to resist repeat poisoning when consuming them.\n\nThis will cause his tongue-hand to shoot out and carry you upwards, fill you with poison immediately, and then slam you down! It's more than likely this will eliminate almost all your health, leaving the poison to finish the job if you aren't quick with an antimiasma pill (or took one earlier).",
