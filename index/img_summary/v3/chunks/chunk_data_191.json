If he proclaims \"To the deepest trench I dive!\" Be ready for him to stick his tail in the ground, only for several giant electrified tails to sprout up in a cluster nearby. You'll need to quickly break off your attack and give them a wide berth, as they'll quickly perform a single huge spin attack all at once!",
