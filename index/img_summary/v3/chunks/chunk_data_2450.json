Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of Yellow Wind Ridge: Sandgate Village, as well as how to defeat its many bosses that include Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, the Earth Wolf, the King of Flowing Sands and his First and Second Rat Princes.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Village Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* Yaoguai Chief - Earth Wolf\n* Yaoguai Chief - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n* **Valley of Despair**\n* Yaoguai Chief - First Prince of Flowing Sands\n## Village Entrance\nMake sure to take the time to view the new additions to the Chapter 2’s Shrines menu. Note that you can still freely fast travel back to any Shrine in Chapter 1’s Black Wind Mountain if you missed out on any secrets. The store is also selling very different items than it was in the previous chapter, and you’ll find that the selection will change based on which chapter you are in:\nYellow Wind Ridge Shrine Shop\n---\nAntimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |\nMind Core (x2) - 720 Will | Silk (x2) - 600 Will | Yaoguai Core (x2) - 450 Will |\nLicorice (x5) - 120 Will | Aged Ginseng (x5) - 90 Will | Fragrant Jade Flower (x5) - 120 Will | Purple Lingzhi (x5) - 90 Will\nFire Bellflower (x5) - 120 Will | Jade Lotus (x5) - 90 Will | |\n\nBefore heading into the village, it’s time to finally find a use for all those plant materials you’ve been gathering. Look just beyond the shrine for a small ditch running under a wooden bridge. You can explore the left side to find a sloping path up to a green Wisp to absorb, and where a mushroom is actually a Lingzhiling creature in disguise. Watch for its poisonous attacks, and kill it to earn a large variety of mushroom items. The ditch also leads below the town’s large gate, but aside from Fragrant Jade Flower to harvest, there’s not much else down here.",

It shows the player character standing near a lit brazier, with a rocky environment and a large humanoid statue partially obscured in the background. A red arrow highlights the statue, suggesting its significance or as a point of interest for exploration. This area appears to be near the ditch mentioned in the preceding text, where players can find items like a **Fragrant Jade Flower** or encounter hidden creatures such as the **Lingzhiling mushroom enemy**. The image serves to visually guide players through this early exploration area in Chapter 2 of the game."
