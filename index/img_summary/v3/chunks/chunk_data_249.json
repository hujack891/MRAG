    "img_summary": "The image depicts two characters in a forest setting, with one character holding a scroll and a brush, suggesting a scene of instruction or preparation. This aligns with the \"Gourds, Gear, and Key Items\" section of the \"Black Myth: Wukong Wiki,\" which discusses transformation power-ups and learning new spells. The visual likely illustrates a moment of acquiring knowledge or items essential for gameplay, such as learning new transformation spells or identifying key items."
