    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the \"Rakshasa Palace\" section of the \"Furnace Valley Walkthrough\" in the game Black: Myth Wukong. It shows a character walking on a lava-filled path towards a large creature, with a highlighted item (possibly a Fire Date) on the ground. The setting is dark and ominous, with a bridge and a green Wisp visible in the background. This image is likely intended to illustrate a specific point in the walkthrough where players need to navigate the lava path, collect items, and possibly confront enemies."
