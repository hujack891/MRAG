Despite being stronger, he's still kind of a pushover, as he doesn't boast much more than your average enemy, even with two distinct phases.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, Daoist Mi can also employ the move used by the Red-Haired Yaksha of Chapter 3, performing two quick fist strikes, and then turning around to perform a reverse bicycle kick that can hit especially hard -- but its still nothing as dangerous as the Scorpionlord.\n\nOnce you deplete their health bar, the Daoist Mi will invoke the power of the worm's egg, transforming into a Worm Practitioner for the second phase of this fight. Like before, much of their attack patterns will follow the basic enemy, so there won't be too much of a surprise in store.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game Black Myth Wukong, specifically during the Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight against Daoist Mi. It shows an intense combat moment where the player character engages with Daoist Mi, who is performing a reverse bicycle kick, a move reminiscent of the Red-Haired Yaksha from Chapter 3. The setting is a picturesque outdoor area with autumnal foliage, suggesting the battle takes place in the Secret Area of Purple Cloud Mountain. This fight is part of a larger quest to defeat various formidable opponents, including the Scorpionlord, as detailed in the Chapter 4 walkthrough. The image captures the dynamic and challenging nature of the encounter, highlighting Daoist Mi's unique attack patterns."
