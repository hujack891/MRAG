    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy landscape with a character holding a staff, walking towards a traditional building complex in the distance, which is partially obscured by trees and rocky terrain. This scene likely represents the Longevity Road section from the \"Valley of Ecstasy Walkthrough\" in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" The character appears to be navigating through the region, possibly towards the Longevity Road Shrine, as mentioned in the preceding text. The environment suggests a challenging journey through a mountainous area, consistent with the narrative of exploring the Valley of Ecstasy."
