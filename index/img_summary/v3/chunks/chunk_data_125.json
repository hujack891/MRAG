By the end of Chapter 2/start of Chapter 3, you can have all of the Skills tabs unlocked (as long as you've explored thoroughly and taken down optional bosses). This will grant you the Alteration, Strand, and Transformations skills.\nAlteration applies to spells like Cloud Step and Rock Solid and will improve the health of your decoy, movement speed, and unlock the chance to deflect attacks with a parry.\nThe Transformations menu applies to any Transformation spells you collect and you'll find skills to improve might recovery, maximum health when transformed, increased defense, and more.\n### Best Transformations Skills to Unlock\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Moon Roam**|  Damage is increased after a Perfect Dodge\n**Evergreen**|  Might decay is reduced\n**Ferocious Form**|  Attack is increased while Transformed\nTransformations add some spice to combat and can be hugely beneficial, especially as they have completely different health and status bars to your character.\n\nFor Rock Solid, Rock Mastery, Ironclad, and Bold Venture are particularly useful.
