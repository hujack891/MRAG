He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\n\nFor each of these attacks, be ready with your Staff-Spin counter, and consider investing in skills to keep this move going and to attack out of it once you've deflected all the projectiles heading your way. A lot of this fight will come down to finding the right opportunities to strike after surviving his attacks, and you'll need all the boosts you can get.\n\nOther times, he may trigger a bunch of explosions on the floor, which only give you a moment's notice to dodge them, so stay mobile and roll around for a better chance of not getting hit.",
