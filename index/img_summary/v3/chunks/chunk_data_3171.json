The scene showcases the Venom Daoist in a dark, temple-like environment with a large tree and glowing light filtering through the background. The player character is engaged in combat, with visible health and ability indicators on the screen. The text \"Taste my keen edge!\" suggests the boss is taunting the player, emphasizing the aggressive nature of this phase of the fight. This visual aligns with the guide's description of the Venom Daoist's increased aggression and reduced openings for retaliation during the second phase of the battle."
