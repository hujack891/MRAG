    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image**:  \nThe image depicts a combat scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, set in a snowy environment near a temple entrance. The player character, Wukong, is engaged in battle with two enemies: a large, muscular foe wielding dual weapons and a skeletal figure armed with a staff. The surroundings include snow-covered ground, rocky formations, and a traditional red temple structure, emphasizing the game's Frost-Clad Path setting.\n\n2. **Purpose/Narrative Role**:  \nThis image illustrates the challenging encounter described in the walkthrough for the Frost-Clad Path section of *Black Myth: Wukong*. It visually represents the hostile environment and enemies players face while navigating toward the Yaoguai Chief miniboss fight (Macaque Chief - First Encounter). The scene highlights the importance of preparation, such as using Body-Warming Pills to counter Frost effects, as mentioned in the preceding text."
