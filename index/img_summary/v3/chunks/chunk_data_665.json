    "img_summary": "The image depicts a large, ominous sculpture resembling a creature with sharp teeth partially submerged in a pool of dark red liquid, possibly blood. This setting is likely part of the Crouching Tiger Temple, where the Civet Sergeant can be found in the game Black Myth: Wukong. The sculpture may serve as a significant landmark or receptacle related to the game's narrative, where players place items after defeating bosses to progress in their quest."
