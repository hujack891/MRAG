    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth Wukong,\" showing a player character in a snowy, forested area near a stone structure. The character is in a gathering stance, with an on-screen prompt to \"Gather\" an item. The red-dotted circle likely indicates the location of the Old Ginseng Guai, an optional miniboss hidden in the Valley of Ecstasy. This visual serves to illustrate the in-game environment and provide a clue for locating the miniboss as described in the \"Where to Find The Old Ginseng Guai\" section of the document."
