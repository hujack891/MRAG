    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the boss fight against Fuban, the Yaoguai King, in the Kingdom of Sahali walkthrough for Black Myth Wukong. The player character is shown engaging in combat with Fuban, who is burrowing into the ground and swimming through the sand. The health bar at the bottom indicates that Fuban's health is partially depleted, aligning with the preceding text that describes Fuban retreating and attacking from below once a third of its health is lost. The image serves to visually represent this phase of the boss fight."
