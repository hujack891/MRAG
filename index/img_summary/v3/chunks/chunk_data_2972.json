The setting appears to be a temple-like area surrounded by rugged cliffs and ancient architecture, including statues and carvings. This scene is likely related to the \"Tiger Relic\" location in *Black Myth: Wukong*, specifically beneath the Crouching Tiger Temple in Yellow Wind Ridge, where the relic can be found. The relic grants a critical hit chance buff when equipped, as described in the preceding text."
