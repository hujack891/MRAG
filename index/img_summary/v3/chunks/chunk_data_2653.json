Many of his attacks inflict Frost, and if your bar fills, you'll have extremely reduced mobility and be unable to dodge many of his attacks. Plan ahead by crafting or buying Body-Warming Pills to offset this.\n\nHe can also heave his blade around that will send his body spinning, attacking with two quick spinning slice attacks. Often times he'll end up holding the blade with his foot, and perform a final upward slash as he backflips, sending out another projectile slash.",
