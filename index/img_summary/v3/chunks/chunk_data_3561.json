The scene shows a large, dark, stone-like creature collapsed or defeated on the ground, surrounded by rocky terrain and remnants of battle. A smaller figure, likely the player character or ally, stands nearby, suggesting the aftermath of a fight.

This visual aligns with the preceding text, which describes the boss's powerful fire-based attacks and strategies for avoiding them."
