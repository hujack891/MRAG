She can lash out with her appendages, which will subtly shift into long blades but also give you a clue as to where her main attacks will come from. As you might expect, you'll also have to deal with dodging both poison and webbing, making mobility key to your survival.\n\nThe Violet Spider shares more than just the look of The Second Sister -- she also uses a few of the same moves with her talon-like appendages. This includes the feint of raising up her front leg to the side before performing alternating downward stabs, followed by a large leaping slam.\n\nThe bad news is even if you've gotten familiar with these attacks, she often follows them by spewing poison right onto the ground in front of her, which will limit your ability to retaliate. Be sure to dodge to the side first before starting your attack to get out of the way of most of her poison.",
