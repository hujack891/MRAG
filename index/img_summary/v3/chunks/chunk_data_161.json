Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.\n\nThe good news is this attack is so powerful it will leave her incredibly drained, and give you plenty of time to retaliate with all your saved up focus points, a Spirit Attack, and anything else you can throw at her!",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the \"Bitter Lake Walkthrough\" in the section titled \"Yoaguai King Boss Fight - Kang-Jin Star\" from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" It shows a character, likely the protagonist, in a snowy environment, crouched and holding a staff, with a large, ornate cymbal embedded in the mountain behind them. This visual likely represents the challenging terrain and environment players will encounter during the Kang-Jin Star boss fight, emphasizing the need for strategic preparation against the boss's electrical attacks. The image's setting aligns with the guide's advice to navigate the mountaintop area after leaving the Warding Temple."
