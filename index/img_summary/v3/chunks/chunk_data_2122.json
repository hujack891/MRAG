Unlike other enemies, he won't use any magic or ranged tricks on you, and trades it all in for overwhelming power and a mastery of martial arts that makes him an extremely challenging foe -- and that's before the restraints come off.\nIf you haven't made use of them in other fights, now is definitely the time to take advantage of all the medicinal pills and consumable buffs you can craft and use. Items like the Tiger Subduing Pellets to raise your attack and others that can raise your stamina or focus can all help out greatly, and you'll want every advantage on your side.\n\nThough he begins with his hands tied, Non-Able is an expert fighter who can utilize some deadly kicks and deal immense damage and can strike with little warning. Any time you see him angle his head down to your right, be ready for a roundhouse kick to spring out fast.",
