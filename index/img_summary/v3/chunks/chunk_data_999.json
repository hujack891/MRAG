    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the \"Field of Fire Walkthrough\" in the \"Ashen Pass III\" section. It shows the boss fight against Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai, a creature wielding a spiked mace. The environment is a rocky, volcanic landscape with small red mushrooms scattered around, likely linked to the boss's attacks as described in the walkthrough. This visual serves to illustrate the challenging encounter players will face in this part of the game."
