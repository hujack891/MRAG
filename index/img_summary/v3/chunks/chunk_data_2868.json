He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).\nAs mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses.\n\nOnce you've gotten him to around 25% of his health (right between the \"M\" and \"a\" in \"Master\", he'll clutch his head for an extended moment, and that's your cue to back off, as he'll no longer take damage for the moment. When he stabs the ground with his sword again, this time he'll channel a spell to bathe the arena in a golden dome. This is actually a great time to use any consumables you have on hand to buff yourself up, restore cooldowns or get back some Focus for the final phase.\n\nDespite this, the new phase won't actually begin until he grabs his sword again and charges at you, twisting his tail to slam down on you, and following up with two slow sword swings. Only then will a short cutscene play, and his true curse comes into play.\n\nAt this point, he'll no longer use his sword, focusing entirely on his electric fists and tail, and somehow dealing even more damage in the process. To make matters worse, he'll massively reduce your maximum stamina while in this golden dome.",
