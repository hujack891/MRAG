You'll need a a lot of armor to withstand his hits, and plenty of poison defense to boot, which means using the Gall Soak, and poison-resistant curios to help you out.\nIf you recall your fights with the three Scorpion Princes in the Webbed Hollow, you may find more than a few of the Scorpionlord's attacks familiar, but don't be lulled into thinking you have him figured out: all of his moves strike faster, hit harder, and will evolve into longer combos as the fight drags on. Much of this fight will be learning his basic combos early, but being ready to adapt when he tricks you with extended attacks when you may otherwise think you have an opening.\n\nExit the area through the top path, and note that you can find a slope up to a second peak, which has a few green Wisps to absorb, and a Dragonfly Guai guarding a rope bridge.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game Black Myth Wukong, specifically within the Secret Area of Purple Cloud Mountain in Chapter 4. It shows a character navigating a rocky path, possibly after defeating the Scorpionlord, a challenging boss in the Yaoguai King Boss Fight section. The character appears to be preparing to ascend a slope leading to a second peak, which is mentioned in the preceding text as containing green Wisps and a Dragonfly Guai guarding a rope bridge. This image likely serves to illustrate the environment and progression path following the Scorpionlord encounter."
