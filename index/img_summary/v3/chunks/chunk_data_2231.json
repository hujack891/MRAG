A mysterious figure, possibly a guard or prisoner, leans against the gate, while a glowing purple aura surrounds Wukong, suggesting magical or combat readiness. The caption reads, \"Stay where you are, newcomer,\" indicating a tense or confrontational interaction. This moment aligns with the preceding text, which describes the eerie dungeon setting of the Pagoda Realm, a prison with circular tiers, and the protagonist's initial steps to escape after being thrown into captivity."
