    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intense battle scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically within the \"Fallen Furnace Crater\" section. The combatants appear to be the Yaoguai King - Yaksha King, who is wielding a glowing sword, and another character in armor. The surrounding environment is dark and rocky, with visible flames and molten areas, suggesting a volcanic or fiery setting. This image aligns with the preceding text, which describes the aggressive nature of the Yaksha King during the second phase of the fight, emphasizing the need for strategic dodging to avoid his attacks."
