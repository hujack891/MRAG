This location corresponds to the Mount Lingtai Seedlings in *Black Myth: Wukong*, found in the Woods of Ember near the Camp of Seasons Shrine in the Flaming Mountains. The image serves as a visual guide to help players locate the Seedlings, which provide a specialized buff for the \"A Pluck of Many\" spell when equipped."
