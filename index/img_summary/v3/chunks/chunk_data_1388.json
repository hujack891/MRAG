The image shows a character standing in front of an altar, which is highlighted with a red circle. This area is significant for obtaining the Dark Thunder Transformation Spell, a missable spell that players can acquire by interacting with a specific cart and defeating the horse guai Ma Tianba earlier in the game. The altar and its surroundings are part of the narrative where players return after defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and the Yin-Yang Fish."
