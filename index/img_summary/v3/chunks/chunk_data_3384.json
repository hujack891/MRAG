She can lash out with her appendages, which will subtly shift into long blades but also give you a clue as to where her main attacks will come from. As you might expect, you'll also have to deal with dodging both poison and webbing, making mobility key to your survival.\n\nOne of her more insidious moves is another  on her webbing attack, where she'll laugh as she sends out strands from her back to slowly arc across the air and seek you out. She'll send these webbing strands out one after the other to try and both slow you down and also deal damage, ending with a huge wave of 12 projectiles in a large arc that all fly to you at once. If you're stuck trying to get out of her earlier webbing, you'll be a sitting duck, making evading the last salvo even harder.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts the intense boss fight against the Yaoguai Queen, known as the Violet Spider, in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The spider is shown mid-attack, unleashing web-like projectiles that arc across the battlefield, a signature move described in the walkthrough as both damaging and immobilizing. The setting is a dimly lit cave with web-covered walls, emphasizing the spider's domain. The player character is engaged in combat, with visible health and ability icons on the screen, highlighting the game's mechanics and the challenge of evading the spider's attacks. This visual accompanies the guide's explanation of the boss's attack patterns and strategies for survival."
