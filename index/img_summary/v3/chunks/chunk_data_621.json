Absorb the green Wisp by the water on the left, then head right and follow the ashen path up.\n## Yaoguai Chief - Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top\n\nLike the other pairs of bosses in the chapters, you'll have them attack you in succession. You'll start with Bottom Takes Top, who will cycle through two moves. He'll leap at you -- just dodge back from this -- and then roll into the ball. You can attack him while he regains his composure when he's inside it.\n\nTo follow this, he'll put his sword away, then jump at you and slam the ball down. He'll then drag it around him. Both of these attacks can be avoided by keeping your distance. Attack when he's getting himself back together, and chip away at his health steadily.",
