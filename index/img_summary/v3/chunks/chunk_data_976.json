    "img_above_text": "# Essential Tips and Tricks\nBlack Myth: Wukong is a challenging action game with some RPG elements, and whether you consider yourself a combat expert or not, there's a lot of essential tips and tricks to learn as you follow in the footsteps of Sun Wukong. Below you'll find important tips for both exploration and combat to start you on the right foot.\n* **Jump to:**\n* **General Tips**\n* **Combat Tips**\n* Exploration Tips**\n## Combat Tips\n* **Know when to use your Heavy Attack in a combo vs when to charge it up or unleash it on its own.** You can upgrade each stance to have your Varied Combos behave differently which can be helpful in certain fights, but expending all your Focus Points at once to unleash a charged hit can easily stagger tough bosses.\n* **Sometimes you'll have to face off against archers or ranged attackers on high ledges with no easy spot to reach them**. In fact, there is a way to close the distance -- you can jump and perform a heavy attack in midair to gain extra height before slamming down, which can often give you the boost you need to reach their platform.\n* **Alternatively, Cloud Step will get you past ranged attackers without being spotted.** If you prefer a stealthier approach, or you're just trying to get beyond a row of archers, using the Cloud Step spell can help massively. Enemies will focus on your replica and leave you to sneak past.\n\n* **Equipping a Spirit isn't just about using their attack.** Each Spirit also provides a passive buff when you aren't using the Spirit Attack, which you can tailor to augment your playstyle -- like dealing more damage when at low health, or increasing your defense if you find yourself getting hit too much.\n\n* **Check-in at Shrines regularly to see new stock.** New items become available after clearing areas of taking down bosses. It's especially important to stop in at Shrines are big fights to see what new Armor and Equipment is available.\n\n* **Upgrade your staff when you can.** The staff is the only weapon you'll need to use, but you'll be able to follow different branches and upgrade it to have certain effects and buffs from your Keeper's Shrine. Always check what you're running with if you're struggling with bosses. Some staffs will give you buffs to stances or spells. But if you're not using those particular ones, you might as well swap to another version of the staff.",
