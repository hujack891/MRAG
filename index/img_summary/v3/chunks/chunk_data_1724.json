To combat Jiao-Loong of Waves, you'll want to use heavy attacks. It's not so steady on its feet, so you can easily knock it over or at least temporarily stun it. This will give you longer periods of time to give it a beatdown without interruption. If you use the Plantain Fan here, it'll be constantly knocked down on the floor, giving you even more time to attack.",
