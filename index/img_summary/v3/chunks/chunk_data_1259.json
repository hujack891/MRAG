    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the \"Fright Cliff Walkthrough\" section titled \"Squall Hideout,\" under the sub-section \"The Fourth Buddha’s Eyeball.\" It shows a character in a rocky, grassy area approaching a large stone head with glowing eyes. This setting aligns with the preceding text, which describes encountering a Man-in-Stone who believes a nearby rock guai holds the secret to reversing his fate. The image likely illustrates the moment the player finds the unusual stone, adding visual context to the narrative."
