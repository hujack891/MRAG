After unlocking the Gourd in Chapter 1, you can start to capture the spirits of enemies and use them in battle. But if you're searching for tips on what the best spirits to use are, here's what we'd recommend.\nLooking for information on every Spirit in the game and how to collect them? Visit our Spirit Locations page.\n## Best Spirits to Use in Black Myth: Wukong\nWhen you use a Spirit, you will temporarily transform into them and be able to perform their special move. Alongside these skills, each Spirit provides a boost to a general stat or status effect, such as an increase in Poison damage or an increase in Defense when performing a particular move like Rock Solid.\nUnlike Transformations, you will share the same health bar with Spirits, so it's crucial to pull them out at the right time. Not sure which Spirits to equip? Here are some we consider to be the best spirits to use in Black Myth: Wukong.\nWandering Wight| Guangmou| Tiger's Acolyte\n---|---|---\nBlade Monk| Non-White| Falcon Hermit\nClay Vajra| Flint Vanguard| Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang (Upgraded)\nRemember that Spirits can be upgraded! At any Keeper's Shrine, you can choose to Cultivate Spirits from the Self-Advance menu. This will allow you to upgrade your Spirits using a combination of Will and items like Blood of the Iron Bull and Tadpoles. If you like a Spirit, cultivate them so you can max out their buffs.\n### Blade Monk\n\nIt's a fairly simple attack that the Tiger's Acolyte offers, but Sharp Edge is a quick hack-and-slash move that can deal a chunk of damage. In addition to the move, you'll also gain a moderate increase in Critical Damage, so using it at the right time can be a powerful attack. As another added bonus, the Qi cost of using Tiger's Acolyte is moderate, while most others are high.",
