Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.\n\nLater on, Kang-Jin Star will appear much closer above you in her dragon form, and use a familiar tail slam to explode the ground around you. Luckily, not only can you dodge or deflect this, but you can then strafe to the right to attack the dragon's head before she transforms back.",
