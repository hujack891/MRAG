When you approach it near the Mantis-Catching Swamp, and land on its head you'll need to approach its antennae. Interact with them and hold on. It will begin to jump around the water, eventually ending up near the Rhino Watch Slope. Your stamina bar will drain as it does this, and you'll only be able to complete the test if it doesn't completely run out before the critter stops jumping. If you're finding it hard to hold on, reset some skills and ensure that Rampant Vigor is maxed out under Survival, and see if you've missed any Celestial Nonary Pill Locations.",
