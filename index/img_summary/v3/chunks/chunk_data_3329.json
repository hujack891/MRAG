It shows a narrow bridge surrounded by webbed cocoons, with a glowing target marked in red at the far end, suggesting a challenging crossing due to enemy threats. The setting is dark and cavernous, emphasizing the danger of falling and the presence of Clawed Cocoons and Dragonfly Guai archers, as described in the preceding text. The image serves to illustrate the treacherous environment players must navigate in this part of the game."
