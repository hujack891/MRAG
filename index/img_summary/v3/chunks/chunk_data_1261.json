    "img_summary": "The image depicts a player-character standing at the edge of a cliff in a rocky, desolate environment, illuminated by warm light. The scene includes a narrow path leading to a platform with a large statue embedded in the cliffside, possibly representing \"The Fifth Buddha’s Eyeball\" mentioned in the walkthrough. This area appears to be part of the Squall Hideout section of the \"Fright Cliff\" region in *Black Myth: Wukong*, where players are warned about ambushes, such as a Poisestone hidden along the walls. The image likely serves to illustrate the atmospheric setting and guide players toward key objectives in this part of the game."
