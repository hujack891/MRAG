With multiple entrances and exits to this area, we’ll start with the first Shrine on the other side of the Crouching Tiger Temple.\n## Windrest Bridge\nTake out any stray Withered Corpses as you head to the top of the path, and you’ll find the Windrest Bridge Shrine.\n\nThe main path will lead straight on the other side of the long roof before you, but look carefully and you’ll spot a new type of ambush - The Rat Imperial Guard. They’ll leap off rooftops to surprise attack you, using twin hookblades for quick strikes, then dodging out of reach — and even throwing their blades at you from a distance.\n\nYou can use your new Rock Solid move to bait them into attacking and deflect to stagger them, opening them up for an assault which you can prolong by Immobilizing them when they try to flee, or use the Thrust Stance to hit them even after they jump away.",
