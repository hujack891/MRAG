Don't wait until then to begin harvesting though—it's still worth grabbing any you find so you can craft as much as you need when the option is available. The more supplies you have in stock, the more advantages you can bring into a fight, including buffs to attack power, damage negation, and resistance!\n\n* **Experiment with different styles and stances.** Since you can reset your skills at any point when resting at a Shrine, try experimenting with different styles or favoring specific stances if you run into a roadblock.
