    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scenic, rocky area with lush greenery and chains hanging from above. In the center, a large winged creature, likely the Yaoguai Chief - Supreme Inspector, is seen hovering, ready for battle. This setting is part of the Verdant Path section in the \"Foothills Walkthrough\" of Chapter 6 in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" The preceding text provides guidance on preparing for the fight against this boss, emphasizing the use of the Plantain Fan over the Fireproof Mantle due to the creature's wing-based attacks."
