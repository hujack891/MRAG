Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the grove and learning how to cultivate Spirits, accessing a secret realm, as well as how to defeat the many bosses of this area that include Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, Guangmou, and the Whiteclad Noble.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Back Hills**\n* **Snake Trail**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n* Yaoguai Chief - Guangmo\n* **Marsh of the White Mist**\n* Boss FIght - Whiteclad Noble\n## Boss Fight - Whiteclad Noble\nThis snake-like noble will attempt to test your resolve, and he’s got the skills to back it up, so don’t take this boss lightly. Oddly enough, despite his appearance, he doesn’t employ any poison attacks, so having the Celestial Lotus Seeds as your gourd’s Soak is the better option for this fight.\nThe Whiteclad Noble opts instead to attack with his strong spear, and can harness the power of water itself to amplify its reach. He’ll use it often to create waves of watery force you’ll need to dodge or suffer a lot of damage from. He’s also not above simply tossing his spear at you, and then calling it back to his hand.\n\nIn addition to this, he can twirl his spear above his head, summoning water above it before slamming it down, sending a straight line of water right at you that you can dodge to the side to avoid.\n\nBeyond that, the rest of the second phase of this fight will come down to anticipating how his body twists before he unleashes his sweep attacks. Keep close and aggressive to dodge around to his sides, using your spells to amplify your attacks, and looking for the right moment to invoke your Spirit Attacks (the Wandering Wight is still a good choice when he’s stationary to flatten him).",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a serene, lush environment with a waterfall cascading down rocky terrain into a calm body of water. Two characters are present: one standing near the water's edge and another kneeling or bowing in the water. The scene is set in a natural, forested area with ancient stone structures partially visible. The caption at the bottom reads, \"The Guanyin Temple now lies in cinders, yet the Elder's soul endures.\" This suggests a narrative context of destruction and resilience, possibly related to the game's storyline and the challenges faced within the Bamboo Grove region in \"Black Myth: Wukong.\""
