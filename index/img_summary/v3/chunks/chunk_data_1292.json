This area is described as being just beyond where the Rat Governor was guarding, and includes a Meditation Spot that grants a free Skill Point for resting. The image likely serves to illustrate the location and atmosphere of the Rock Clash Platform, as well as to highlight the presence of collectible items and points of interest within the game."
