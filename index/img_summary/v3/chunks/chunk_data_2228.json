You'll need to stick to the main road through the Forest of Felicity to find a high ridge path, and take one of several exits on the left to enter the Towers of Karma area.\n### Old Ginseng Guai Miniboss Fight and Guide\nThis hulking brute isn't as deadly as the Non-Able boss fight, but he does has a few tricks up his sleeve. As you might expect, he can deal a lot of damage with poisonous roots much like the lesser Ginsengling, so having antimiasma medicine on hand is a good strategy.\nMany of the Old Ginseng Guai's attacks are slow and hard-hitting, and the guai himself moves at a fairly slow pace, making him the perfect target for hit and run attacks as needed.\n\nStick to staying in safe spots to keep using Thrust Stance out of the range of his roots, or Pillar Stance above him, and look for his many openings when he tumbles to the ground to press the attack, and he'll fall before long, granting you both the **Old Ginseng Guai Spirit** , Millenium Ginseng Seeds to give to Chen Loong, and the **Ginseng Cape** to wear.",
