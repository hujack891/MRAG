Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n* Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n* Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Yellowbrow\nNo longer the small chubby monk you've seen previously, this much larger giant of a man is an incredibly dangerous and formidable foe, and uses a host of lightning attacks to try and inflict Shock status on you. Taking double damage from any of his attacks is highly inadvisable, so make sure your Shock-Quelling Powder is on your quickbar for this fight.\nYellowbrow chiefly attacks with a large spiked mace while he holds his magic seedbag in the other hand. Be incredibly wary of his weapon, as it has the ability to change its shape, and he can extend the handle at will both in size, length, and flexibility.\n\nEarly on, he'll reappear just to gloat, and if you see him raise his arms in a taunt, that's your cue to retaliate by expending your focus points to hit him hard. Three Focus Points on a Pillar Heavy Strike can often send him staggering to his knees, giving you a lot of opportunity to continue your assault.\n\nJust be warned that as the battle progresses, he'll come out of his vanishing act with another attack prepped, so you'll need to both find his new position (or listen for it), and react quickly.",

Yellowbrow, a large figure wielding a spiked mace and a magic seedbag, is seen attacking the player character with lightning-based attacks, which can inflict Shock status.
