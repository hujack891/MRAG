Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n* Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n* Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n## Yaoguai Queen Boss Fight - Violet Spider\nMuch like The Second Sister, this boss will take the form of a gigantic and fearsome spider, and uses attacks in a few similar ways. She can lash out with her appendages, which will subtly shift into long blades but also give you a clue as to where her main attacks will come from. As you might expect, you'll also have to deal with dodging both poison and webbing, making mobility key to your survival.\n\nWhen she goes into a frenzy of stamping down all of her legs quickly, she'll do so while spewing out poison in several directions. Try to stay one step ahead of her by keeping to her right side, and watch for her final talon stab at her front to your right, sending out another plume of poison, but leaving the rest of that area exposed to a counter attack.\n\nShe also has a nasty habit of rapidly twitching her body while standing still, only to suddenly pivot and slam her rear into you at full force, which can deal a ton of damage. Even if you're at range, expect webbing strands to fly out that you need to dodge or deflect with your staff spin.",
