    "img_summary": "The image depicts a boss fight scene from the game Black Myth: Wukong, specifically the second encounter with Zhu Bajie in the Webbed Hollow area. The player character is engaged in combat with Zhu Bajie, who is wielding a staff and appears to have the advantage due to the muddy terrain. The mud hinders dodging but allows sprinting, suggesting strategic movement is crucial. The image illustrates the intense and challenging nature of this battle, aligning with the walkthrough's advice on using spells and precise dodging techniques to overcome Zhu Bajie's attacks."
