    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the \"Fright Cliff Walkthrough\" guide. It shows the \"Mother of Stones,\" a giant crystal-embedded statue, which is a mini-boss in the \"Squall Hideout\" section. The Mother of Stones itself does not engage in combat, but players must endure waves of attacks from smaller enemies called Palestones. The image highlights the boss's health bar and the game's interface, providing a visual reference for players following the guide."
