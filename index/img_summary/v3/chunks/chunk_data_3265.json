    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically during the boss fight against the Water-Wood Beast, an optional Yaoguai Chief in Chapter 6. The beast, partially submerged in water, appears to be a large, tree-like creature with glowing red areas, indicating weak points or damage. A character, likely the player, is positioned behind the beast, wielding a weapon, which aligns with the strategy of staying behind the beast to avoid frontal attacks and take advantage of immobilization opportunities. The surrounding environment is a forested area with a calm water body, setting the stage for this hidden and surprise-attack-prone boss encounter."
