He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\n\n* Level 1 - Right next to where you entered the realm, you can open the door to speak face to face with the Prisoner. He mentions Lotus-Vision was one of his four Captains, and that Yellowbrow tricked him and imprisoned him here, taking control of his Captains in the process. He'll request that you kill them all to ease their suffering. You can also pull the sword out of the dead two-headed Rat Captain and gain the Ashen Slumber Transformation Spell, letting you turn into a Rat Captain yourself and inflict fire, building up focus to transfer back to your main form.",
