Though it's a vertical strike, it has a great deal of reach, sending a tremor along the ground from its force.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn’t even his only unpredictable leaping attack, as he can also just vault at you at top speed from a fair distance without a hint of preparation and cleave you with his sword for massive damage.\n\nOne leaping attack with a bit more warning will come when he jumps high into the air first, moving right above you before slamming down with his sword. The impact will be fierce, and even trying to use Rock Solid will simply send both of you stumbling back, so dodging is the better call here.
