A cutscene will start to play, where you'll transform into a Cicada and fly toward the center of the hall. This is where you'll find Pingping speaking to her mother, Rakshasi, accompanied by the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains.\nAfter they discuss The Destined One obtaining the relics, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains offers to care for Rakshashi, which Pingping protests. After he binds Pingping, Rakshashi is revealed to be Zhu Bajie transformed and it's time to take on the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains for yourself.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Crimson Silver Cart\nIf you've exhausted all the dialogue with the Pale-Axe Stalwart so far, the first thing you'll notice is that you've got his help when it comes to beating this boss.\n\nThe only real difference between this fight and the one with the previous carts is that the Crimson-Silver Cart has a wider area that it attacks in. Not only will it shoot flames out at the bottom all around it, but it will also roll around and try to mow you down.\n\nAs soon as you see smoke start to build around it, you'll want to move out of its way, because this is when the fire is coming. Beyond that, you'll also notice tweaks to the punching attacks. Rather than just slamming its fists down once, it will try to land a combo of punches.\n\nTo make the fight easier, use Immobilize to keep the cart locked in place. That way, you and the Pale-Axe Stalwart can work together to quickly whittle down its health.\n\nCrimson-Silver Cart",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black: Myth Wukong,\" specifically from the section titled \"The Emerald Hall\" in the \"Furnace Valley Walkthrough.\" It shows a confrontation between two characters: one appears to be a humanoid figure wielding a large weapon, and the other is a larger, beast-like creature holding a massive axe. This scene likely represents a boss fight, specifically against the \"Yaoguai Chief - Crimson Silver Cart,\" as described in the preceding text. The context suggests that the player, possibly with the help of an ally named Pale-Axe Stalwart, must defeat this boss by avoiding its wide-area flame attacks and immobilizing it to reduce its health."
