    "img_summary": "The image depicts a gameplay scene from *Black Myth: Wukong* during the \"Frost-Clad Path\" section of Chapter 3. The player character, resembling the Monkey King, is engaged in combat with the Macaque Chief miniboss in a snowy courtyard surrounded by traditional architecture. The player is wielding a staff and appears to be preparing for an attack while the Macaque Chief, a large humanoid enemy, is mid-action. The UI displays health bars, abilities, and controls, suggesting active combat mechanics. This encounter introduces the first phase of the Macaque Chief fight, where players must strategize against Frost-inflicting attacks and prepare with items like Body-Warming Pills to mitigate mobility penalties."
