    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the video game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically showing a character standing next to barrels with a golden glow emanating from one of them. This glow indicates the presence of an Awaken Wine Worm, an item that enhances healing effectiveness. The character appears to be in a dimly lit area with intricate wooden lattice windows, suggesting a location within \"The Estate of the Zhu,\" as described in the metadata and preceding text. The image serves to illustrate the in-game environment where players can find and collect the Awaken Wine Worms."
