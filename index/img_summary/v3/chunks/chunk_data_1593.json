Generally speaking, when an enemy initiates their attack, that's the moment you want to press R2 and Triangle (PS5), RB and Y (PC/Controller) or 2 (PC/Keyboard).\nEach enemy will have different timings to their attacks, however, so it might take some practice getting it right for the different Yaoguais.

Slaying the Tiger Vanguard will automatically grant you the Rock Solid spell and let you turn your monkey into stone.\n\nOnce you have the spell, visit a Keeper's Shrine and select Self-Advance to see the option to Set Spells.
