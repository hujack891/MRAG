    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, rocky landscape with a large arch-like rock formation in the center. In the foreground, a character in elaborate armor stands facing the formation, holding a staff or weapon. This scene likely represents a significant location in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically the Verdant Path in the foothills of Mount Huaguo, as mentioned in the context. The character's stance and the dramatic lighting suggest a moment of anticipation, possibly before encountering the Giant Shigandang, a key event described in the section \"Where to use the Four Skandhas\" from Chapter 6 of the game."
