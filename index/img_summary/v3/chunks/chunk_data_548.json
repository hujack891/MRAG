As with previous Secret Areas, this one has its own separate shop where you can purchase things not found in the rest of the Webbed Hollow, which can help you toward crafting better weapons and armor:\nPurple Cloud Mountain Shrine Shop\n---\nTiger Subduing Pellets (x3) - 360 Will | Antimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will | |\nCold Iron Leaves (x2) - 900 Will | Fine Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will | Refined Iron Sand (x4) - 1200 Will | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Will\nGentian (x5) - 90 Will | Tree Pearl (x3) - 180 Will | Jade Lotus (x3) - 90 Will | Snake-Head Mushroom (x3) - 120 Will\n\nThe start of this region is a linear mountain path lined with a few materials to harvest, and up ahead you'll hear the sounds of someone crying. The \"someone\" is actually a snake guai (named Hong Yi). The widower was forced out of her mountaintop village by insect guais led by the Scorpionlord, rendering her unable to retrieve her late husband's keepsakes.\n\nShe'll warn you of the dangerous venom of the enemies ahead, and you can even find a **Treasure Chest** near her that holds 3 Antimiasma Powder that will be incredibly useful when taking on the Scorpionlord.\n\nHead across the bridge to the right and grab a green Wisp, and go through the archway into the next larger area.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character in a scenic autumn forest setting, likely within the Valley of Blooms section of the Purple Cloud Mountain walkthrough from Black Myth Wukong. The character appears to be gathering resources, specifically Gentian, as indicated by the text overlay. This scene aligns with the narrative context of exploring a linear mountain path and collecting materials to aid in crafting weapons and armor, as described in the walkthrough guide. The vibrant foliage and serene environment contrast with the underlying quest to defeat formidable enemies, including the Scorpionlord, highlighting the dual nature of exploration and combat in this secret area."
