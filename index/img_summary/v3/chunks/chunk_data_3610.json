    "img_summary": "The image depicts a tense moment from the Yaksha King boss fight in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The Yaksha King, a menacing figure with fiery attacks and a glowing blade, is shown mid-action in a dark, rocky battlefield illuminated by scattered flames. On the right, the protagonist, Wukong, appears poised to engage, emphasizing the intensity and challenge of this climactic encounter. This visual aligns with the guide's description of the Yaksha King's aggressive second-phase combat style, where he uses sweeping and overhead sword attacks that create dangerous trails of energy."
