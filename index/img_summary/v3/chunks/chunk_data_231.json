    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically within the \"Precept Corridor\" section of the \"Bitter Lake Walkthrough.\" It shows two characters in a snowy, temple-like environment. One character, dressed in traditional robes and a beaded necklace, is gesturing with their hand, while another character, resembling a humanoid boar, stands nearby. The subtitle at the bottom of the image reads, \"Buddha? Where is it?\" indicating a dialogue or quest related to finding a Buddha statue. This scene likely occurs after defeating the Red-Haired Yaksha and before resting at the nearby pavilion as described in the walkthrough."
