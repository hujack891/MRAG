    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically in the Flaming Mountains area. It shows a character standing next to a tree with Luojia Fragrant Vines, identifiable by the small, golden berries on the vines. The character is prompted to \"Gather\" the vines, which are used to increase the number of times a player can use their Gourd for health. The environment features rocky terrain and a stream of lava, consistent with the Flaming Mountains setting described in the metadata and context."
