Below, you'll find a Walkthrough for the first major area of The Flaming Mountains called Woods of Ember, as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Ashen Pass I**\n* Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\n* Yoaguai Chief - Brown-Iron Cart\n* **Camp of Seasons**\n* **Height of Ember**\n* Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones\n* Yoaguai Chief - Gray-Bronze Cart\n* Yoaguai Chief - Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind\n* **Ashen Pass II**\n## Camp of Seasons\n### Tip!\nWhen Revenant Charbones explode, it's not just you that they damage - other enemies will be affected as well. Whenever you see them, focus on attacking one and luring it closer to other enemies, to take advantage of their explosive abilities. When they're in groups, and each one has a low health bar, this can sometimes cause a chain of explosions as they knock each other out one by one.\n\nExit the little cave and continue on, where you'll see two more Revenant Charbones with a larger figure (a Revenant Charface) straight ahead. Clear these out first, and be careful of the fast slashing attacks from the Revenant Charface, which also continues once you've killed it.\n\nWhen it's safe, turn back on yourself. The Fire Bellflower that was on the left as you exited the small cave will now be on the right, and you'll see a path on the right that leads to the next section.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts the exit of a dark cave leading to a brighter, rocky outdoor area. A highlighted red marker indicates a specific point of interest near the cave's exit. This visual is part of the \"Woods of Ember Walkthrough\" for the \"Camp of Seasons\" section in the game Black Myth: Wukong. The preceding text provides a tip about using the explosive abilities of Revenant Charbones to damage other enemies, suggesting that the image may be illustrating the cave mentioned in the tip, where players encounter these enemies and need to be cautious as they proceed."
