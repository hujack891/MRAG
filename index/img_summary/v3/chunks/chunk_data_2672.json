    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game *Black Myth: Wukong*, specifically within the snowy environment of the \"Snowhill Path\" area mentioned in the walkthrough. The player character, dressed in yellow robes and wielding a staff, is exploring a snow-covered landscape surrounded by rocky cliffs and sparse vegetation. The interface shows the acquisition of \"Fire Bellflower Seed,\" a collectible item, with a notification indicating the player has obtained two seeds. The setting aligns with the context of the \"Mirrormere\" section, where the protagonist is navigating the frozen terrain leading to the shrine and preparing for upcoming challenges."
