Despite being stronger, he's still kind of a pushover, as he doesn't boast much more than your average enemy, even with two distinct phases.\n\nThe one big new move that Daoist Mi can use in this form is spewing a lot more poison across the arena. In particular, if they arch backwards for a long moment before getting up, they'll run towards you while spewing poison in every possible direction. Knowing this in advance, simply keep your distance or prepare a charged thrust attack to repel them.",
