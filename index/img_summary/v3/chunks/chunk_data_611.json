Though the boss has two phases, you may not have as much trouble as you did with The Scorpionlord, since you won't have to deal with poison, and their attacks are a bit easier to read and counter. Strangely enough, it also starts the fight at around 75% of its health, but it does have a second health bar waiting, so pacing yourself can be the key to this fight.\n\nLuckily, the moment he lands you can swap into a pillar stance and charge up to avoid the attack and retaliate with a strong charged hit.",
