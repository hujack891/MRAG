Much of this fight will be learning his basic combos early, but being ready to adapt when he tricks you with extended attacks when you may otherwise think you have an opening.\n\nDo note that later on in the fight, he can bait you with this attack by whirling away and starting to leap, but extending his tail far head instead to stab you!",
