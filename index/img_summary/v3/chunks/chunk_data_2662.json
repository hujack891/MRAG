The player character is shown walking towards a Keeper's Shrine, indicated by a red arrow. This shrine is significant because it allows the player to use the Snow Fox Brush to transform back into fox form, which is essential for progressing in the quest. The image visually supports the text's explanation of how to return to fox form and confront the monk after examining the fox's body."
