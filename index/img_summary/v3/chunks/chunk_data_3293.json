However, each new weapon will require you to defeat one, or several, of the dozens of Black Myth: Wukong bosses scattered across the game’s chapters.\nMost compulsory bosses will unlock a new piece of gear like a weapon, but you will often need to kill an optional boss in a side area to get the right crafting materials to craft the weapon in question. This guide will take you through all the weapons in the game, their stats, unique effects, and where they can be found.\n## Black Myth: Wukong Weapons Locations\nBelow, you can find a list of all the weapons in the game, how you can unlock them.
