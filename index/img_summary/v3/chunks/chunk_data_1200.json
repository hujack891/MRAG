    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from a game or interactive narrative set in a rocky, forested area. A character is seen approaching a glowing green object embedded in a rock wall, with an on-screen prompt to \"Gather\" it using the \"RT\" button. This aligns with the preceding text from \"The Forest of Wolves\" under the \"Front Hills\" section, which instructs the player to harvest the **Jade Lotus** in the water before encountering tougher enemies. The image visually represents the gathering of resources as part of the gameplay progression."
