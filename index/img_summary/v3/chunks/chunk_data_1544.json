The altar is highlighted with a red dashed circle, positioned near a tree and rocky terrain. An arrow indicates the direction to approach the altar, helping players locate it just to the right of the Cliff of Oblivion Keeper's Shrine, in the water. This visual serves as a guide for players seeking to collect all purple talismans to unlock hidden content, including cutscenes and a boss encounter."
