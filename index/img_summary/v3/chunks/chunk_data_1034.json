    "img_summary": "The image depicts the Yaoguai King - Red Boy, a fiery boss encountered in the \"Fallen Furnace Crater\" section of the *Field of Fire Walkthrough* for *Black Myth: Wukong*. The scene showcases the Red Boy surrounded by intense flames and wielding a fire-imbued weapon, emphasizing his mastery over fire-based attacks. This visual aligns with the preceding text, which describes his combat style, including fire projectiles and close-range fire arcs, and suggests strategies for players to mitigate elemental damage using Body-Cooling Powder and a Fireproof Mantle. The image serves to illustrate the dramatic and challenging nature of this climactic encounter in the Flaming Mountains."
