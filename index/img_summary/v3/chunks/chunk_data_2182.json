Finding opportunities to get your own attacks in can be difficult, but you'll need to resist the urge to jump in too early or you'll be hit and staggered multiple times.\nGiven his long sweeping swings, having backup from A Pluck of Many or Spirits that summon other allies won't work as well as they'll tend to get hit even if he's focusing all his attention on you.\n\nThe one thing his powered up gauntlet isn't great at deflecting is Transformation attacks -- both from Spirits and Spells. The Ashen Slumber in particular is a good bet, as the Rat Captain has a very long evasive dash, and you can breath fire on him that can't be blocked, nor can your Fiery Burst detonation.\n\nTime your attacks well to find the gaps in his defenses, and remember to cultivate your Spirits and upgrade your Transformation Spell abilities as needed. When Non-Pure is finally defeated, you'll be able to absorb the last disciples spirit, the Non-Pure Spirit.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a detailed and ornate statue within a temple setting, likely the New Thunderclap Temple mentioned in the context. This area is significant in the game \"Black Myth Wukong,\" specifically in Chapter 3, where players encounter the optional miniboss Non-Pure. After defeating Non-Pure, players are advised to explore the boss room to find the last Meditation Point in Chapter 3, which grants a free Skill Point. The image serves to illustrate the environment and atmosphere of the temple where these events take place."
