    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from the game Black Myth: Wukong, specifically from the \"Equipment\" menu under the \"Spirits\" section. It highlights the \"Mad Tiger\" Spirit, which players can equip after defeating the Mad Tiger boss. The Mad Tiger Spirit has an ability called \"Boulder Smash,\" allowing the player to take the form of the Mad Tiger and perform a powerful roar that deals area damage and knocks back enemies. The equipped effect significantly increases the player's Attack but greatly reduces their Maximum Health. This Spirit is designed for players who can effectively avoid damage while maximizing their offensive capabilities."
