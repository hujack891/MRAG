It shows an intense battle between the player character and Daoist Mi, who is wielding a sword and performing an upward slash in a reverse grip stance, which can emit projectile waves. The setting is a rocky and autumnal landscape, aligning with the Purple Cloud Mountain area described in the walkthrough. The image captures the dynamic combat style and environment, emphasizing the challenge of defeating Daoist Mi, a stronger version of the Sword Daoists encountered earlier in the game."
