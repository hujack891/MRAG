He’ll be resting against the far wall, and complaining about the meat. What he really wants now is some Jade Lotus. You should already have plenty of that stored away, but if not, you can easily find some in most pools of water, especially the large pool where you first entered the chapter.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically within the Yellow Sand Formation region. It shows a character standing in front of a large statue, likely part of the Crouching Tiger Temple, and a seated creature resembling a Yaoguai. The text overlay suggests the character is preparing to undertake a task or challenge, possibly related to the Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Tiger’s Acolyte mentioned in the metadata. The setting and characters align with the guide's focus on exploring Windrest Hamlet and facing the Tiger's Acolyte."
