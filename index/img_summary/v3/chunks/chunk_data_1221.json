    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"The Forest of Wolves,\" specifically from the section titled \"Black Wind Mountain’s Secret - Ringing the First Bell.\" It shows a character running through a forested area towards a dark entrance, indicated by a red arrow. This entrance likely leads to the location of the first bell mentioned in the preceding text, which the player needs to ring as part of their quest. The character appears to be carrying a pole, which aligns with the narrative of interacting with a bell to progress in the game. The image serves to visually guide the player towards the next objective in the walkthrough."
