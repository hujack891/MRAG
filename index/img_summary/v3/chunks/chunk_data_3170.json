    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the \"Valley of Ecstasy Walkthrough\" in the section titled \"Longevity Road.\" The character is shown obtaining a \"Mind Core\" material, which is likely a reward or item necessary for progression. The setting includes a snowy landscape and an ancient, ornate structure, suggesting a significant location within the game.
