The Five Element Carts guard passages throughout the Flaming Mountains, but you'll need to beat four of them if you want to enter Bishui Cave. Here's everything you need to know to complete this questline, including a detailed walkthrough below.\n1. Defeat the Pale-Axe Stalwart\n2. Defeat the Brown-Iron Cart\n3. Defeat Gray-Bronze Cart\n4. Speak to Pale-Axe Stalwart Again\n5. Defeat Crimson-Silver Cart\n6. Find the Cooling Slope\n7. Defeat Rusty-Gold Cart\n8. Speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart One More Time\n### Defeat Gray-Bronze Cart\nContinue on the main path in the Chapter and past the Father of Stones mini-boss. Open the door and go past the statue, along the bridge, and into the cave.\nThe Gray-Bronze Cart health bar will appear as soon as you step onto the bridge, and you'll hear someone shout \"Help!\". You'll need to work your way down to it, however, by going through the cave.\n\nAs you go up the stairway past the Pale-Axe Stalwart, you'll be quickly met with the first of the carts, which is the Brown-Iron Cart. It doesn't have great variation in attacks, so try to stick to near its arms instead of its head to avoid the continuous fire attacks. Then, just watch out for when it slams its fists down, and dodge these attacks. The Fireproof Mantle Vessel will help hugely here if you have it and for the rest of the bosses in this questline.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, narrow passageway lined with intricately carved stone pillars, leading towards a cave entrance. This setting is part of the quest to unlock the Chapter 5 secret area in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" Specifically, it illustrates the path players must navigate to encounter and defeat the Gray-Bronze Cart, one of the guardians of the Flaming Mountains.
