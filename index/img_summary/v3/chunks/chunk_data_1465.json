    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy landscape with a character in a red outfit holding a staff, walking towards a large, twisted tree. The setting includes ancient-looking stone pillars and a forested area covered in snow. The text \"Fire. I need fire...\" is displayed at the bottom of the image, suggesting the character's need for warmth or a light source. This scene is likely part of the quest to find the Green-Capped Martialist in the game \"Black Myth Wukong,\" as described in the preceding text. The character appears to be navigating through the Valley of Ecstasy, possibly on the way to uncover the secret Melon Field mentioned in the quest."
