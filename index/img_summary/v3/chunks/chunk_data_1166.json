    "img_above_text": "# Foothills Walkthrough\nChapter 6 of Black Myth: Wukong begins in the Foothills of Mount Huago with Zhu Bajie and the Destined One starting their ascent up the mountain after acquiring five of the Great Sage's relics. Below, you'll find a Walkthrough of the first major area of Mount Huaguo as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Verdant Path**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Supreme Inspector\n* Yaoguai Chief - Jiao-Loong of Waves\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 1\n* Yaoguai Chief - Feng-Tail General\n* **Rhino Watch Slope**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 2\n* Yaoguai Chief - Gold Armored Rhino\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Baw-Baw\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 3\n* **Deer Sight Forest**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Cloudtreading Deer\n* Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 4\n* Yaoguai Chief - Water-Wood Beast\n* **Mantis-Catching Swamp**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Emerald-Armed Mantis\n* Yaoguai Chief - Son of Stones\n* Yaoguai King - Giant Shigandang\nThe beginning of Chapter 6 is a linear path, so proceed down the slope from where you spawn. As you make your way along this road, you'll be intercepted by the last of the Lesser Yoaguais you need to complete your journal.\n## Mantis-Catching Swamp\nNow that you've cleaned up the majority of the optional bosses, it's time to find the last of the main bosses. You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis.\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Son of Stones\nLand behind the Sone of Stones on the cliff and then attack to start the fight. He won't immediately jump up, so you can get a couple of free hits in.\n\nUnlike other stone bosses, the Son of Stones mostly uses an elemental attack. The blue glow coming from him is in fact a charge, and he will throw out projectiles or summon waves of lightning to crash down around him. Have Shock-Quelling Powder equipped to combat any lightning damage he might inflict.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a large, glowing stone creature with green luminescent cracks and lightning effects, set in a dark, forested landscape. This creature is likely the \"Yaoguai Chief - Son of Stones,\" a boss character in the \"Mantis-Catching Swamp\" section of the \"Foothills Walkthrough\" for the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" The preceding text provides a strategy for engaging this boss, noting its elemental attacks and the need for Shock-Quelling Powder to mitigate lightning damage. The image visually supports the narrative by illustrating the formidable appearance and environment of the Son of Stones."
