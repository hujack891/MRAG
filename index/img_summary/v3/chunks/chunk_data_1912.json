    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the \"Man-in-Stone Questline\" in *Black Myth: Wukong*, specifically during the encounter with the Yaoguai Chief Miniboss, the Mother of Stone. The player character, armed with a staff, faces a large, glowing, stone-like entity in a dimly lit cave adorned with carved statues and a burning brazier. The text overlay suggests a narrative twist, with dialogue indicating deception or betrayal, as the speaker claims to have obtained a treasure. This moment likely represents a climactic or pivotal interaction in the questline, tied to defeating the Mother of Stone and acquiring key items like the Stone Essence."
