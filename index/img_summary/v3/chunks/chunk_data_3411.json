    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the \"Verdure Bridge\" section of the \"Webbed Hollow - Middle Hollow Walkthrough.\" The player character is seen in a dimly lit cave area covered in spider webs, approaching three treasure chests marked by red arrows. The context suggests that this area contains a supposed treasure, hinted at by a mysterious woman encountered earlier in the walkthrough. The image serves to illustrate the location of these treasures within the Verdure Bridge section."
