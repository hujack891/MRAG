The description highlights its main ability, \"Precept Upholder,\" which allows the player to take the form of Non-Pure and use a monk's spade to attack enemies. The equipped effect of this spirit moderately increases damage reduction for a short duration after performing the Rock Solid spell, which is used for parrying in the game. The image also displays various other spirits that can be equipped, along with the player's current stats and options to watch a demo or equip the spirit."
