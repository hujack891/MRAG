Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of The New West: Snowhill Path, as well as how to win your first encounter with Macaque Chief, and defeat the mighty Kang-Jin Loong.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Frost-Clad Path**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n* **Mirrormere**\n* Yaoguai Queen - Kang-Jin Loong\nIn Black Myth Wukong's third chapter, the Destined One will travel far from the arid deserts to the snowy mountaintops of The New West, where you'll spy an odd character masquerading as a statue.\nOnce you've taken off your own disguise, you'll find yourself in a frozen cave full of giant statues with only one way forward. That way is blocked by a tough looking new enemy, the Monk Supporter.\n## Frost-Clad Path\n\nGrab the green Wisp and absorb it as you head up the final tunnel section of this cave, which will bring you at last to a large field of Snowhill Path. You can find some Gentian plants around here as you exit, and up ahead you can find the Frost-Clad Path Shrine.\n\nLike the previous chapters, this shrine has a whole new store for you to browse, and you'll also be able to start investing in crafting the Ochre Armor Set and Rat Sage Staff (or possibly the Loongwreathe Staff as well if you defeated the Red Loong and Black Loong in the previous chapters). These weapons will cost a fair amount of Will and other materials, so check your inventory often for when you have enough to upgrade, and also look into stocking up on new items:\n\nThe New West Shrine Shop\n---\nBody-Warming Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Longevity Decoction (x3) - 270 Will |\nMind Core (x4) - 1800 Will | Cold Iron Leaves (x2) - 900 Will | Refined Iron Sand (x1) - 1200 Will |\nAged Ginseng (x10) - 90 Will | Fire Bellflower (x10) - 120 Will | Tree Pearl (x10) - 180 Will | Snake-Head Mushroom (x10) - 120 Will\nGolden Lotus (x5) - 180 Will | Celestial Pear (x5) - 240 Will | |\n\nFrom the shrine, head up the path through the mountain.
