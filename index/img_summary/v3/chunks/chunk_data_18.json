Focus built up before transformation can be converted for use afterwards within the rat guai's form.\nAshen Slumber's moveset is as follows:\n* **Light Attack: Chop Wood - Swing the iron blade to build up Focus.** This is a standard four-hit combo.\n\n* **Spell: Fiery Burst - Upon self-detonation, deals area damage triggers de-transform.** This is a manual de-transform attack that can be activated to have Ashen Slumber blow up.",
