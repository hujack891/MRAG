He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\n\nYou'll find find Captain Lotus-Vision in front of a large group of kneeling corpses, which he can randomly imbue with magic to create a Withered Corpse that will come to life and attack you. These are nothing more than a distraction, but should still be dealt with immediately so they don't hamstring you later.\n\nLuckily, he'll get rid of all the corpses later in the fight, and they won't respawn for future attempts.\n\nMuch of this boss's power comes from a purple crystal mounted on the tip of a staff he carries against his shoulder, which will expend a variety of projectile attacks. Some will be easier to anticipate than others, but you'll always want to keep that crystal in view.",
