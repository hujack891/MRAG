    "img_above_text": "# The Great Sage's Broken Shell\nThe Great Sage's Broken Shell is one of the main and final bosses you'll fight in Chapter 6 of Black Myth: Wukong. You'll jump into this fight as soon as you finish against The Stone Monkey, and it's the final one needed to see the ending of the game.\n## The Great Sage's Broken Shell Boss Fight and Guide\nFor this fight, you can expect two phases as well. You'll essentially be going up against a better version of yourself, with access to fully unlocked skills and stances that are also available to you.\nHe'll use variations of **Vengeful Mirage, which leaves an exploding illusion behind, Rock Solid, Ring of Fire, and Pluck of Many**. On top of this, he'll use Smash, Pillar, and Thrust Stance attacks.\n### The Great Sage's Broken Shell Phase Two\nAt the start of this phase, the Great Sage will remove your relics from you, so you'll lose the buffs you selected when unlocking them. This is when you'll want to rely more on your Medicines, Curios, and Spells, especially Ring of Fire to build up your focus quickly. It can be much harder to hit him during this phase, so you'll need to play it somewhat safe to build up your focus.\nYou also need to be careful when using your Gourd at this stage. When you do, it's best to dodge to be safe but try to limit your use of it. This is because the Great Sage can Immobilize you and steal your Gourd for himself.\n\nIn this phase, you'll generally see the same attacks as the first phase, but there will of course be additional variations or they will be heightened. One of these changes includes the Great Sage's Broken Shell climbing to the top of his staff just like before, but this time, unleashing a flurry of projectiles. Tap dodge and roll to the side quickly to avoid this and build up focus while doing so. Then be prepared for him to slide down toward you, skim the water, and quickly dash back at you to try for another hit.\n\nHis combos will also become more aggressive and dangerous, and you'll see him jump up in the air and spin his staff multiple times. It will glow red as he smashes it down, and you'll need to dash out of the way to avoid it doing huge amounts of damage.",
