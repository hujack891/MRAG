    "img_above_text": "# The Great Sage's Broken Shell\nThe Great Sage's Broken Shell is one of the main and final bosses you'll fight in Chapter 6 of Black Myth: Wukong. You'll jump into this fight as soon as you finish against The Stone Monkey, and it's the final one needed to see the ending of the game.\n## The Great Sage's Broken Shell Boss Fight and Guide\nFor this fight, you can expect two phases as well. You'll essentially be going up against a better version of yourself, with access to fully unlocked skills and stances that are also available to you.\nHe'll use variations of **Vengeful Mirage, which leaves an exploding illusion behind, Rock Solid, Ring of Fire, and Pluck of Many**. On top of this, he'll use Smash, Pillar, and Thrust Stance attacks.\n### The Great Sage's Broken Shell Phase One\nThe Great Sage's Broken Shell will start this phase by dodging your attacks each time you try to complete combos. As these are perfect dodges, you'll see multiple illusions left behind in its wake, which will explode after a few seconds. To counter this, you'll want to land a few hits, and then jump back to avoid the explosions, but continue to follow up and complete the combos for a heavy attack.\n\nWe'd suggest throwing out the Plantain Fan as soon as the fight starts, to knock him back, and allow you to whittle his health down quickly before he even gets a chance to start. In terms of Transformations and Spirits, we found that Ebon Flow was useful for deflecting his attacks and quickly building might to perform a powerful finisher, and the Wandering Wight Spirit was able to take down a chunk of his health in one go.\n\nYou'll see the Great Sage's Broken Shell's version of a heavy attack, as the staff glows gold and he jumps up with his staff to smash it down on you. These moves can also be evaded, to help build up your own focus for a counterattack. Again, you'll want to take advantage of Wukong's arm and staff in this fight, by using the fourth focus point for heavy attacks, and making use of the increased Critical Hit Chance.\n\nWhen the Great Sage uses his variation of Pluck of Many, you'll see a duplicate appear as close as possible to you and will swing its staff. This will disappear after attacking, so you won't have to face multiple duplicates all at once.",
