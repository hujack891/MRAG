It shows a bird-like character, possibly the Supreme Inspector, perched on a rooftop, looking down at another bird on the ground. The caption reads, \"Foul monkey. No matter how many times you reincarnate, you're still blind to the ways of this world.\" This suggests a confrontation or dialogue before or during the boss fight, emphasizing the Supreme Inspector's disdain for the protagonist."
