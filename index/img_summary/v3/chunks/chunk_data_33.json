Unlike some of the other Transformations, Azure Dust doesn't have much flexibility in how you use it. But, it has some powerful attacks even the Transformation is hard to control.\nThe Transformation allows you to transform into a rock guai, immune to all Four Banes. Azure Dust also builds up Might when hit. Azure Dust's moveset is as follows:\n* **Light Attack: Earth Shatter - Strike the enemy three times with your heavy head**. This is a powerful slam on the ground with your head that can be repeated.\n\n* **Heavy Attack: Mountain Splitter - Dash forward with full force. Fully charge to dash further**. This is a slow, but heavy charged dash which can pin enemies and also get you out of danger if needed. It lacks a lot of control, however.",

In this transformation, the player character has turned into a rock guai, as indicated by the rocky appearance and the on-screen prompts for the \"Earth Shatter\" and \"Mountain Splitter\" attacks. The environment is a rugged, rocky terrain with steps leading up to a higher area, suggesting an in-game location where the transformation's abilities might be utilized.
