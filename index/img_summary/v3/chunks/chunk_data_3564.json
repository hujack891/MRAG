    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, rocky landscape with a set of stairs leading up to a structure resembling a temple or shrine. A character, likely The Destined One from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" is seen at the bottom of the stairs, holding a glowing weapon. The red arrow in the image suggests a direction or path to follow, likely indicating the next step in the walkthrough for the \"Camp of Seasons\" section. This aligns with the preceding text, which provides a tip for dealing with Revenant Charbones and mentions finding a Purple Lingzhi near the bottom of the stairs."
