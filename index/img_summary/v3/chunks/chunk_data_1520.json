    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth Wukong,\" showing a player character standing near a large rock formation with human-like faces. This rock is significant as it is located near the Stone Vanguard Yaoguai King boss, which can be defeated by summoning another boss, the Shigandang Yaoguai King. The on-screen prompt \"RT Deliver\" suggests an interaction point, possibly related to summoning or engaging with the boss. The image serves to illustrate the location and context for finding and interacting with the Stone Vanguard and Shigandang bosses as described in the accompanying text."
