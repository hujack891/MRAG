    "img_summary": "The image depicts a rugged, ancient landscape with dilapidated structures and rocky terrain, likely representing the Kingdom of Sahali, a secret area in Chapter 2 of the game Black Myth Wukong. The scene includes two characters, one of whom appears to be engaged in combat or action. This visual context aligns with the preceding text, which describes the Kingdom of Sahali as a hidden area accessible through specific in-game tasks and encounters, including a miniboss fight with the \"Tiger Vanguard.\" The image serves to illustrate the environment and atmosphere of this challenging and secretive location within the game."
