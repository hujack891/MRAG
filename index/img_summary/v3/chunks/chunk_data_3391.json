    "img_above_text": "# Webbed Hollow - Lower Hollow Walkthrough\nThe Webbed Hollow is the second main area of Black Myth: Wukong's Chapter 4, concluding with the lower portion of the large underground cave system. Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n* Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n* Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n## Yaoguai Queen Boss Fight - Violet Spider\nMuch like The Second Sister, this boss will take the form of a gigantic and fearsome spider, and uses attacks in a few similar ways. She can lash out with her appendages, which will subtly shift into long blades but also give you a clue as to where her main attacks will come from. As you might expect, you'll also have to deal with dodging both poison and webbing, making mobility key to your survival.\n\nHere you'll find one last Shrine for the Webbed Hollow, meaning the final boss of this particular area is fast approaching. As with other bosses in this realm, poison can be a big factor in the fight, so it's worth crafting extra Antimiasma Pills, and equipping poison resistant gear, curios, and Gourd soaks to help out where possible.\n\nWhen you're ready to face the mother of spiders, head through into the large cave opening to face the Lady of the Webbed Hollow. You'll learn more about her tragic life during the adventures of Wukong as she speaks with Zhu Bajie, and once you interrupt the scene, you'll need to prepare for battle.",
