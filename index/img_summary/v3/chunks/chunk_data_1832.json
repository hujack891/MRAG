Much as Chapter 2's frog boss was imbued with lightning attacks, so too does this boss have the power of ice on his side, and unless you take precautions, you'll be frozen solid and out of stamina -- unable to move while you're torn to pieces.\nHaving body warming medicine for this fight is a must, and it's highly recommended you equip the Frostspout Twig Curio, Fiery Gourd, and Circle of Fire Spell to offset his many frost-filled attacks.\n\nHis tongue-lashing attack has now been altered to be even more deadly: It will create fields of frost on the ground as it swings back and forth -- and also lob rocks at you each time his tongue whips back, forcing you to stay mobile out of the frost and dodging the boulders at the same time.",
