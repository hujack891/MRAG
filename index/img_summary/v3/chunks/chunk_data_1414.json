But, the buff it offers is definitely useful for those looking for a pick-me-up in the middle of a fight.\nWith the Goat Skull equipped, using the Gourd moderately increases maximum health for a short duration. This duration is rather brief, but in the middle of a fight or when at low health, it can give you an extra buffer beyond your regular health to either be more aggressive, or flee and take out an enemy or two on the way.\n## Black Myth: Wukong Goat Skull Location\nThe Goat Skull can be found at random by picking up Licorice plants. There isn't a set location or spot, you will just need to search for the purple Licorice plants throughout the game's chapters and hope that it drops for you. Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge has the most, especially in the early Sandgate Village area.\n\nSoaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd itself, so you are stuck with the length of this health boost. It can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, be sure to visit the Shen Monkey Vendor throughout your game to continue equipping new ones.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" showing a character standing in a grassy area next to a purple Licorice plant, which can be gathered. This plant is significant because collecting Licorice plants may randomly yield the Goat Skull, a valuable item that temporarily boosts maximum health when used with the Gourd. The Goat Skull is not tied to a specific location, requiring players to explore areas like Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge to find it. The image illustrates the gathering mechanic in the game, emphasizing exploration to enhance gameplay through health-boosting items."
