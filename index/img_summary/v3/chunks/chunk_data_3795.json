If you think this may limit his moves, you’re unfortunately in for a rude awakening. The Yellow Wind Sage has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, and is not only a deadly attacker, but a master of the Samadhi Winds — but more on that later.\nMake sure you're suitably prepared for the fight in the best ways possible: Craft a bunch of medicine to increase your damage absorption and max health, and allocate any Mind Cores you’ve found toward Celestial Medicine buffs. You should also have a full set of either the Galeguard or Insect armor fully crafted, as well as the Cloud-Patterened Stone Staff from defeating the optional Sihandang boss. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you’ve beaten the Chapter 2 Secret Boss and equipped the new Vessel, the Wind Tamer.\n\nA fully charged heavy thrust with a few focus points built up can also usually stagger him to the ground, and give you plenty more time to follow up with big hits, Spirit attacks, and Transformation Spells (we recommend sticking with Red Tides due to his mobility for chasing him down).",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a mystical scene where a figure is holding a glowing object, possibly a skull, with particles emanating from it. The accompanying text, \"You are the sole worthy one to keep it,\" suggests a moment of recognition or reward following the defeat of the Yellow Wind Sage, the final boss in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong. This scene likely represents the culmination of the boss fight, where the player receives a significant item or acknowledgment for their victory. The narrative context implies that this is a pivotal moment in the game's storyline, marking the transition after the challenging encounter with the Yellow Wind Sage."
