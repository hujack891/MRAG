    "img_summary": "The image depicts a boss fight scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically within the \"Temple of Yellow Flowers\" area. The character shown is the \"Supreme Inspector,\" a formidable opponent in the game. The scene is set in a lush, outdoor environment with stone structures visible in the background. The Supreme Inspector is engaged in combat, emitting a fiery aura, suggesting a powerful attack. The image aligns with the walkthrough's section titled \"Boss Fight - Supreme Inspector,\" where players are advised that this encounter is a prelude to a more significant battle later in the game, and the goal is to survive rather than win, by reducing the Inspector's health by 10%."
