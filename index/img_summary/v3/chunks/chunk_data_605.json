Though the boss has two phases, you may not have as much trouble as you did with The Scorpionlord, since you won't have to deal with poison, and their attacks are a bit easier to read and counter. Strangely enough, it also starts the fight at around 75% of its health, but it does have a second health bar waiting, so pacing yourself can be the key to this fight.\n\nIn addition to its various sweeping arm attacks, it can also take to the air for a different kind of attack, twisting its body into a spinning strike that hits multiple times (but only needs to be dodged once). It will stay in the air and flap up, holding its position for a long moment before slamming down with a single hoof for one final strike. The timing can take some getting used to, but with practice you can avoid it regularly and then retaliate as it pauses for a moment.",
