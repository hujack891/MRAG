Below you'll find a guide for the Temple and its main boss fight against the Tiger Vanguard, as well as the secret Cellar beneath it once you have the Keeness of Tiger.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai King - Tiger Vanguard\n* **Temple Cellar**\nThe Crouching Tiger Temple is one of the two sub-regions you’ll need to explore in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong in order to unlock the large sealed doors that lead to the end of the chapter. You can first reach this area by heading through the Sandgate Village and defeating the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, taking the left path through the Valley of Despair and through a crack in the wall leading to a small canyon.\n## Temple Cellar\n\nSlide down the rest of the way, and you’ll come up to a Shrine for the Crouching Tiger Temple’s Cellar. In the far corner of the cellar, you’ll find a familiar friendly face - the Xu Dog you helped get medicine recipes for!\n\nTalk to him while he’s in front of his large furnace, and the Xu Dog will thank you for your help thus far with a Mind Core. He'll also teach you the art of crafting your own Celestial Medicines in addition to the Mortal Medicine consumables you’ve been creating.",

The buffs range from the familiar ones like health/stamina/mana increases much like the Celestial Pills, but also other stats like Crit Chance or resistance to certain afflictions.\n\nThe best part of these new passive buffs is that you have the option to reset them like your Skill Tree, which will give you back all the Mind Cores you’ve used thus far, allowing you to come back and reallocate points to suit your needs.\n\nBefore heading out, be sure to also buy the **Longevity Decoction** formula for 2,700 Will. It will allow you to craft a consumable that temporarily raises max health, allowing you to survive a bit longer in deadly boss fights.\n\nDown past the Shrine, you’ll finally find the way down to the final boss of Chapter 2. However, there’s a lot more to the Yellow Wind Formation sub-region than just the boss, including the path beyond the Crouching Tiger Temple, and the other doors yet to be unlocked.

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a crafting menu from the game Black Myth: Wukong, specifically within the Temple Cellar section of the Crouching Tiger Temple walkthrough. It shows the option to create a Jade Lotus Pill, a celestial medicine that permanently and moderately increases maximum health. Crafting this item requires 540 Will and 3 Mind Cores. The menu also displays the player's current health, mana, stamina, defense, and various resistance stats. This scene aligns with the context, where players learn to craft celestial medicines using Mind Cores, enhancing their abilities for upcoming challenges."
