    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically within the Crouching Tiger Temple area. A character, likely the player, stands in a rocky, ancient temple environment with statues and a lit brazier. This setting is significant as it is where players obtain the Keeness of Tiger item after defeating the Tiger Vanguard boss. The Keeness of Tiger is essential for progressing in Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge, allowing access to various locked areas and paths."
