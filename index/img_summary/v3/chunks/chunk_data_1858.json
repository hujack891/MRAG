You'll find him just inside the Warding Temple, harassing the Wise Master until you intervene.\nAfter a second defeat, you'll face him one last time near the end of the chapter, in-between two bouts that you'll have with the end boss, Yellowbrow.\n* First Encounter\n* Second Encounter\n* Final Encounter\n### Final Encounter - Mahavira Hall\n\nWhen you fight him a second time, he'll largely have the same moves, but as an added bonus for this fight, you can actually use the Ancient Master's circle of fire to your own advantage, as the Macaque Chief can't move through it.
