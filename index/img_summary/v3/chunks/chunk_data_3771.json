Below you'll find a guide both for exploring the optional area of the Windrest Hamlet and the Tiger's Acolyte, as well as the final main boss fight against the Yellow Wind Sage.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Windrest Bridge**\n* **Windrest Hamlet**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Tiger's Acolyte\n* **Windseal Gate**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Gore-Eye Daoist\n* Yaoguai King - Yellow Wind Sage\nThe Yellow Wind Formation is the final sub-region you’ll need to explore in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong to reach the Chapter Boss, but also includes a large optional village area of Windrest, and several paths leading to the boss from sealed stone doors. With multiple entrances and exits to this area, we’ll start with the first Shrine on the other side of the Crouching Tiger Temple.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Yellow Wind Sage\nThe final boss of Chapter 2 is a hulking rat who holds an incredible trident spear in one hand, while the other carries… a giant head? If you think this may limit his moves, you’re unfortunately in for a rude awakening. The Yellow Wind Sage has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, and is not only a deadly attacker, but a master of the Samadhi Winds — but more on that later.\nMake sure you're suitably prepared for the fight in the best ways possible: Craft a bunch of medicine to increase your damage absorption and max health, and allocate any Mind Cores you’ve found toward Celestial Medicine buffs. You should also have a full set of either the Galeguard or Insect armor fully crafted, as well as the Cloud-Patterened Stone Staff from defeating the optional Sihandang boss. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you’ve beaten the Chapter 2 Secret Boss and equipped the new Vessel, the Wind Tamer.\n\nA fully charged heavy thrust with a few focus points built up can also usually stagger him to the ground, and give you plenty more time to follow up with big hits, Spirit attacks, and Transformation Spells (we recommend sticking with Red Tides due to his mobility for chasing him down).",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a significant moment in the narrative of \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically during the Yaoguai King Boss Fight against the Yellow Wind Sage. It shows a character holding a mystical object, possibly the giant head mentioned in the context, with sparkling effects surrounding it. The accompanying text, \"You are the sole worthy one to keep it,\" suggests the completion of a pivotal quest or battle, where the player is deemed worthy of possessing this item. This scene likely marks the transition to the next chapter, following the defeat of the Yellow Wind Sage and the reunion of the head with its owner."
