The Five Element Carts guard passages throughout the Flaming Mountains, but you'll need to beat four of them if you want to enter Bishui Cave. Here's everything you need to know to complete this questline, including a detailed walkthrough below.\n1. Defeat the Pale-Axe Stalwart\n2. Defeat the Brown-Iron Cart\n3. Defeat Gray-Bronze Cart\n4. Speak to Pale-Axe Stalwart Again\n5. Defeat Crimson-Silver Cart\n6. Find the Cooling Slope\n7. Defeat Rusty-Gold Cart\n8. Speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart One More Time\n### Defeat Gray-Bronze Cart\nContinue on the main path in the Chapter and past the Father of Stones mini-boss. Open the door and go past the statue, along the bridge, and into the cave.\nThe Gray-Bronze Cart health bar will appear as soon as you step onto the bridge, and you'll hear someone shout \"Help!\". You'll need to work your way down to it, however, by going through the cave.\n\nAs you go up the stairway past the Pale-Axe Stalwart, you'll be quickly met with the first of the carts, which is the Brown-Iron Cart. It doesn't have great variation in attacks, so try to stick to near its arms instead of its head to avoid the continuous fire attacks. Then, just watch out for when it slams its fists down, and dodge these attacks. The Fireproof Mantle Vessel will help hugely here if you have it and for the rest of the bosses in this questline.",

This scene is likely part of the \"Defeat Gray-Bronze Cart\" section in the guide \"How to Unlock the Chapter 5 Secret Area\" for the game Black Myth: Wukong. The pathway appears to be within a cave, aligning with the preceding text that describes navigating through a cave to encounter the Gray-Bronze Cart boss. The image serves to visually guide players on the environment they will encounter as they progress through this part of the questline."
