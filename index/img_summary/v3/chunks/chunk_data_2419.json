    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic boss fight scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, as described in the \"Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind Boss Fight and Guide\" section. A player character, armed with a staff-like weapon, stands in a dark, rocky arena surrounded by eerie, fire-lit structures. Two distinct boss enemies are visible: a fiery, horned head floating menacingly in the air and a large, pale head resting on the ground. This visual aligns with the preceding text, which describes the encounter with the two giant heads, \"Quick as Fire\" and \"Fast as Wind,\" in Chapter 5 of the game."
