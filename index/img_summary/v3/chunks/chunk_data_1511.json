    "img_summary": "The image depicts an intricately designed shrine-like structure set in a forest environment, with a small flame burning nearby. The text overlay on the image reads, \"What are you waiting for?\" This image likely serves as a visual prompt within the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" encouraging players to interact with the shrine to claim their Deluxe Edition items. The preceding text explains the process of claiming these items in-game, suggesting that players will encounter such structures early in the game, specifically in Chapter 1's Forest of the Wolves."
