    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the \"Valley of Ecstasy Walkthrough\" in the \"Towers of Karma\" section of the game Black Myth: Wukong. It shows a character wading through a stream in a snowy, forested area. The character is holding a staff and appears to be heading towards a glowing object marked by a red circle on the far side of the stream. This image likely illustrates a specific point in the walkthrough where players are directed to explore the stream area to find important items or objectives."
