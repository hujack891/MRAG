You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive. You should also have the Loongwreathe or Kang-Jin Staff, and have a good set of spells equipped that compliment your attacks -- we reccomend Immobilize and Rock Solid, but you can also try using the Ring of Fire to buff yourself up in since the arena is small.\nThe Cyan Loong doesn't have a huge amount of attacks, but when they hit, they hit hard!\n\nOne of his most common attacks will have him briefly swim toward you before diving in to perform two standing sword slashes in quick succession. He'll follow up by floating high and charging up lightning in his hand to strike the ground in front of him, requiring you to dodge both the attack and the resulting strike that appears at the point he touches.",
