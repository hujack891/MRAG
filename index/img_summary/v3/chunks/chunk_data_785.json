    "img_above_text": "# Crouching Tiger Temple Walkthrough\nThe Crouching Tiger Temple is one of two possible second main regions of Chapter 2 in the Yellow Wind Ridge of Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide for the Temple and its main boss fight against the Tiger Vanguard, as well as the secret Cellar beneath it once you have the Keeness of Tiger.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai King - Tiger Vanguard\n* **Temple Cellar**\nThe Crouching Tiger Temple is one of the two sub-regions you’ll need to explore in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong in order to unlock the large sealed doors that lead to the end of the chapter. You can first reach this area by heading through the Sandgate Village and defeating the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, taking the left path through the Valley of Despair and through a crack in the wall leading to a small canyon.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Tiger Vanguard\nCompared to the slow and measured slams of the Stone Vanguard, the Tiger Vanguard is a relentless beast of a foe. You’ll need to be well prepared to take him down, and make sure you have the best armor and weapons crafted. If you haven’t been using them much before, now is also an excellent time to invest in crafting consumable medicines. Items like the Evil Repelling Medicament to reduce incoming damage, and the Tiger Subduing Pellets to increase your own.\n\nUnfortunately, after the fight goes on for a bit, he won’t wait around to fool you. Whether you strike his stone form or not, he’ll use his own version of Cloud Step to race around the arena, and try to ambush you from a random angle. Watch for the signs of the blood splashing to anticipate where he’s coming from, and either let your stamina recharge to evade, or turn the tables on him with a Cloud Step of your own when he comes out of hiding.\n\nAfter the fight has raged for a bit and you may think you have a handle on this, you must still beware the Tiger Vanguard’s sword. He may deploy it sparingly, but when unsheathed it can deal a world of hurt and easily kill you before you’re able to find a time to heal. Knowing when that blade is coming is crucial to surviving the latter half of the fight.",
