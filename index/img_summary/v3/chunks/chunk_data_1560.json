    "img_summary": "The image depicts a rocky, cliffside path in a dark, cavernous environment, with a red arrow pointing to a specific location on the path. This visual likely serves as a guide for players to find the Skandha of Thought in Chapter 3 of the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" The metadata and context suggest that this location is within the Valley of Ecstasy, specifically at Mindfulness Cliff. The image is intended to help players navigate to the precise spot where the Skandha of Thought can be found."
