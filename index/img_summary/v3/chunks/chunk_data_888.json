The red-circled object in the doorway likely indicates the location of the Sobering Stone, which is the quest item the player needs to find. The in-game interface displays the character's current resources, including \"Will\" and \"Fire Bellflower.\" This visual aids players in identifying the exact spot to find the Sobering Stone as described in the quest instructions."
