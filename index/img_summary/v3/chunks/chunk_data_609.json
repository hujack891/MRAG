Though the boss has two phases, you may not have as much trouble as you did with The Scorpionlord, since you won't have to deal with poison, and their attacks are a bit easier to read and counter. Strangely enough, it also starts the fight at around 75% of its health, but it does have a second health bar waiting, so pacing yourself can be the key to this fight.\n\nOne will be a series of projectiles slashes as he spins about, sending one horizontal projectiles followed by a cross slash projectile. He'll then take to the air and slam down with his sword for a third and final strike.\n\nIf he's at a middle distance, he's much more likely to perform the same spin attack, only extending his blade instead to slash at you physically with two quick spinning slashes, and then taking to the air.",
