    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, eerie scene featuring a large, menacing creature with multiple limbs and a golden, ornate headpiece, standing in a dimly lit environment. This creature is likely the Yaoguai King, Captain Wise-Voice, referenced in the section titled \"Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Captain Wise-Voice\" from the document \"The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm.\" The preceding text describes a challenging encounter where defeating a final Lantern Sentry can yield a special item, the Auspicious Lantern Curio, which grants a unique ability. The image serves to visually represent the formidable boss fight setting and the intimidating presence of the Yaoguai King."
