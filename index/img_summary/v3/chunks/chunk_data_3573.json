He will lazily swing an arm at you a few times. But these can be dodged or missed entirely if you step back far enough. Alternatively, he will reach out to try and hit you, and often falls down straight away after performing the attack. As it takes a little while for him to recover, you can get your own combo of attacks in here.\n\nHe will sometimes leap in the air and try to land on you. Again, these can be dodged and ignored by stepping back. This is actually the case for most of his attacks, so bait him out to hit you and then take advantage of the slow recovery. If you stand behind him too long though, he'll sit down and quickly push himself toward you, rolling over and over to try and catch you.",
