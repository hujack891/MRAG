You can first reach this area by heading through the Sandgate Village and defeating the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, taking the left path through the Valley of Despair and through a crack in the wall leading to a small canyon.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Tiger Vanguard\nCompared to the slow and measured slams of the Stone Vanguard, the Tiger Vanguard is a relentless beast of a foe. You’ll need to be well prepared to take him down, and make sure you have the best armor and weapons crafted. If you haven’t been using them much before, now is also an excellent time to invest in crafting consumable medicines. Items like the Evil Repelling Medicament to reduce incoming damage, and the Tiger Subduing Pellets to increase your own.\n\nDefeating the Tiger Vanguard will award you a Mind Core, and the Keeness of Tiger, the second Key Item needed along with the Sterness of Stone to finally open the big stone doors in this chapter that lead to the final boss. In fact, there’s one of those tallies in this very arena that can open up a secret path!\n\nTiger Vanguard",
