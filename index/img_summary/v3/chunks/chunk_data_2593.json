    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character in a green outfit and a horned mask, holding a weapon in a forested, rocky area. The character is shown with a determined expression, accompanied by the caption, \"I'll kill you to unbind our destinies.\" This scene likely represents an encounter with the Yellow Loong, a secret boss in Chapter 4, as described in the preceding text. The image visually supports the narrative of confronting formidable hidden bosses within the game."
