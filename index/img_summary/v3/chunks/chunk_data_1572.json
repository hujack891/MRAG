    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, rocky tunnel with twisted, leafless trees and an opening that leads to a brighter area. This scene is likely the tunnel mentioned in the context, which players need to pass through in Chapter 6 of \"Black Myth: Wukong\" after collecting the Skandha of Form, Feeling, Thought, and Choice. The tunnel is part of the Verdant Path in the Mount Huaguo Foothills, where players will use the Four Skandhas to unlock a secret boss."
