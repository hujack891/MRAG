    "img_summary": "1. **Summary of the Image:**  \nThe image depicts a game scene from *Black Myth: Wukong*, showing the protagonist standing before a cracked wall adorned with intricate carvings of seated figures. The character wields a glowing, fiery staff, and a prompt labeled \"Go In\" appears on the screen, indicating an interactable entrance. This likely represents the secret passage revealed during the fight with the First Prince of Flowing Sands, as described in the preceding text.\n\n2. **Purpose and Narrative Role:**  \nThe image illustrates the aftermath of a key moment in the \"Valley of Despair\" section of the *Sandgate Village Walkthrough*. It visually confirms the discovery of the secret entrance in \"The Loong’s Secret Tomb,\" which is unlocked by luring the boss into breaking the curved wall during combat. This ties into the guide's explanation of uncovering hidden areas and progressing through the chapter."
