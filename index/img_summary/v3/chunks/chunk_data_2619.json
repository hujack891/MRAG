Despite that, the Macaque Chief is not to be taken lightly. Many of his attacks inflict Frost, and if your bar fills, you'll have extremely reduced mobility and be unable to dodge many of his attacks. Plan ahead by crafting or buying Body-Warming Pills to offset this.\n\nThe Macaque Chief is fairly proficient with the giant curved blade he wields, and begins the fight by slamming it down to send a vacuum slice projectile right at you.",
