    "img_summary": "### Summary of the Image:\n\nThe image depicts a battle scene from the \"Longevity Road\" section of the *Valley of Ecstasy Walkthrough* in *Black Myth: Wukong*. It shows a large humanoid enemy, likely the giant mentioned in the preceding text, crouched on the snowy ground after being damaged. The glowing effect on its head suggests the player is exploiting its vulnerability to build focus points and deal additional damage. The snowy environment, scattered trees, and visible player interface reinforce the game's combat and exploration mechanics in this area. The image serves to illustrate the encounter described in the walkthrough, emphasizing the strategy of targeting the giant's head during its weakened state."
