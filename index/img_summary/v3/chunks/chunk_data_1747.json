You can reach this boss by making your way through the Pagoda Realm and through the Temple of Warding and out the back to a large slope you can slide down onto Turtle Island.\n### Kang-Jin Star Boss Fight and Guide\nLike the other Kang-Jin, expect this fight to involve a heaping helping of electricity, and stock up accordingly on Shock-Quelling medicine, or you'll be taking a lot of damage. Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.\n\nAfter taking a bit of damage, she can teleport away to appear high up in the air. Often times, this will start by turning into a larger electrical dragon resembling Kang-Jin Loong.\n\nWhen she's far away, she'll roar to create a lightning storm of sorts, causing large spear-like projectiles to hit the ground with an electric explosion, and only a moment's warning for where they'll strike.",
