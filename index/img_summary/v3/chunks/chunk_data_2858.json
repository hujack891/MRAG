You'll have a moment to close the distance and get some hits in, but be ready when you see him raise his arms wide and begin to spin around as he advances, as his sword will reappear in his hand to perform two quick downward slashes, and then imbue his sword for a final slash (but you can deflect the two earlier slashes to stagger him).",
