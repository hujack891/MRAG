    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth Wukong\" in Chapter 3, specifically within the Valley of Ecstasy region. It shows a character standing in a snowy landscape, facing a large gnarled tree and a Treasure Hunter sitting on the ground, seemingly freezing. The area is marked by ancient structures and pillars. This scene is part of the quest to find the Green-Capped Martialist, a secret boss fight. The character is likely searching for clues or interacting with the Treasure Hunter to progress in the quest. The text overlay suggests historical significance, mentioning that Buddha planted watermelons in this area hundreds of years ago."
