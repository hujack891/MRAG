Though the game helps by limiting the skills trees you can first interact with, there is still a wide variety of skills to choose from. With so many choices, choosing which skills to unlock can be daunting, but our guide is designed to help you decide which skills to unlock.\n**Jump to:**\n* How to Unlock Skills in Black Myth: Wukong\n* How to Understand the Early Game Skills Trees\n* How to Understand the Mid-to-Late Game Skills Trees\n* Best Foundation Skills to Unlock\n* Best Staff Stances Skills to Unlock\n* Best Mysticism Skills to Unlock\n* Best Alteration Skills to Unlock\n* Best Strand Skills to Unlock\n* Best Transformations Skills to Unlock\n## How to Understand the Mid-to-Late Game Skills Trees\nWhen you hit level 20 and beyond, you'll start to unlock even more of the Skills Trees. By the end of Chapter 2/start of Chapter 3, you can have all of the Skills tabs unlocked (as long as you've explored thoroughly and taken down optional bosses). This will grant you the Alteration, Strand, and Transformations skills.\nAlteration applies to spells like Cloud Step and Rock Solid and will improve the health of your decoy, movement speed, and unlock the chance to deflect attacks with a parry.\nThe Transformations menu applies to any Transformation spells you collect and you'll find skills to improve might recovery, maximum health when transformed, increased defense, and more.\n\nFinally, Mysticism is where you can control the first spell you’ll learn - Immobilize. This will improve the duration of the Immobilize effect, and allow you to cause more damage when attacking using this.",
