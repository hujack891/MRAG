    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic and intense moment from the Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow boss fight in *Black Myth: Wukong*. Bathed in fiery red light, the scene showcases Yellowbrow, a towering and menacing figure, wielding his spiked mace amidst a chaotic and ominous environment. The glowing orb, possibly representing a lightning attack or magical ability, highlights the danger of his Shock-inflicting powers. This visual aligns with the walkthrough's description of Yellowbrow's formidable presence and his use of lightning-based attacks, emphasizing the need for strategic evasion and preparation during the fight."
