    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, eerie battlefield scene from the video game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically within the \"Woods of Ember\" area. The scene shows multiple characters engaged in combat, including the boss Pale-Axe Stalwart, who is fighting nearby Revenants. The environment is desolate, with leafless trees and scattered flames, suggesting an intense and dangerous setting. This image corresponds to the \"Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\" section of the \"Ashen Pass I\" walkthrough, emphasizing the need for players to be prepared for both combat and environmental hazards like firebombs."
