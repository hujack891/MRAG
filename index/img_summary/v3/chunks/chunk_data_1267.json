    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically during the mini-boss fight against the \"Mother of Stones\" in the Squall Hideout section of the Fright Cliff region. The scene shows an intense combat moment with the \"Mother of Stones\" character, whose health bar is visible at the bottom of the screen. The surrounding environment appears to be a cave, consistent with the preceding text describing the location as a large cave system. The image serves to illustrate the in-game battle against this mini-boss, providing visual context for the walkthrough guide."
