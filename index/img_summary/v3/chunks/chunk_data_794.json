Below you'll find a guide for the Temple and its main boss fight against the Tiger Vanguard, as well as the secret Cellar beneath it once you have the Keeness of Tiger.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai King - Tiger Vanguard\n* **Temple Cellar**\nThe Crouching Tiger Temple is one of the two sub-regions you’ll need to explore in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong in order to unlock the large sealed doors that lead to the end of the chapter. You can first reach this area by heading through the Sandgate Village and defeating the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, taking the left path through the Valley of Despair and through a crack in the wall leading to a small canyon.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Tiger Vanguard\nCompared to the slow and measured slams of the Stone Vanguard, the Tiger Vanguard is a relentless beast of a foe. You’ll need to be well prepared to take him down, and make sure you have the best armor and weapons crafted. If you haven’t been using them much before, now is also an excellent time to invest in crafting consumable medicines. Items like the Evil Repelling Medicament to reduce incoming damage, and the Tiger Subduing Pellets to increase your own.\n\nWhen at last the Tiger Vanguard is finally beaten by your attacks, he’ll turn to stone and crumble away. The headless musician will reappear, and return Sun Wukong’s legendary stone form back to the Destined One, giving you the **Rock Solid Spell**! This is your one big defensive parry, taking the place of Cloud Step to completely negate and incoming attack when timed right, and will stagger the enemy to open them up for attack.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the \"Crouching Tiger Temple Walkthrough\" section titled \"Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Tiger Vanguard.\" It shows the player character standing before a large, intricately carved stone structure with an option to \"Examine\" a statue. The on-screen text indicates that a new anecdote about the Yaoguai King has been recorded. This scene likely follows the defeat of the Tiger Vanguard boss, as described in the preceding text, where the player is rewarded with the \"Rock Solid Spell\" after the boss turns to stone and crumbles."
