Items like the Tiger Subduing Pellets to raise your attack and others that can raise your stamina or focus can all help out greatly, and you'll want every advantage on your side.\n\nAnother can be done at range, so even if you think you're at a safe distance, be ready to dodge if he adopts a stance and then dashes up for a glowing elbow strike attack.",
