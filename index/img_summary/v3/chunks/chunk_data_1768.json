The Keeper of the Flaming Mountains is a master of deception and uses his Yin-Yang ability to produce more than just the Yin-Yang Fish in this showdown.\n## Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and Yin-Yang Fish Boss Fight and Guide\n### Missable Transformation Spell\nAs we mentioned earlier, at the start of Furnace Valley there is a dead cart. You need to pull the string and exhaust the dialogue from the horse guai Ma Tianba before you defeat him in this fight. Otherwise, you will miss out on the Dark Thunder Transformation Spell. Once you've beaten the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and the Yin-Yang Fish, return to the cart and pull the string to get the Transformation Spell.\n\nYou'll see the Yin-Yang Fish rear itself up from the water and spray a jet at you, or flip itself up and over, to try and hit you with a tail flick. Staying close to it will stop it from being able to hit you with the jet spray, but will make it more likely to try and tail-whip you.\n\nIt will also use projectiles and throw out orbs to chase you down. These can be dodged or outrun in a similar manner to that of the Keeper of the Flaming Mountain's attacks.",
