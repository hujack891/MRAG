    "img_summary": "The image depicts a boss fight scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically the second encounter with the Yaoguai King, Yellowbrow. The player character is engaged in combat with Yellowbrow, who is unleashing a powerful lightning attack. The on-screen text reads, \"You are at the end of your wits, with no one to turn to. Why persist with this farce?\" This image aligns with the section titled \"Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\" in the walkthrough, illustrating the intense and challenging nature of the battle."
