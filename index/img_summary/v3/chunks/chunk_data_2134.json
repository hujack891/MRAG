Unlike other enemies, he won't use any magic or ranged tricks on you, and trades it all in for overwhelming power and a mastery of martial arts that makes him an extremely challenging foe -- and that's before the restraints come off.\nIf you haven't made use of them in other fights, now is definitely the time to take advantage of all the medicinal pills and consumable buffs you can craft and use. Items like the Tiger Subduing Pellets to raise your attack and others that can raise your stamina or focus can all help out greatly, and you'll want every advantage on your side.\n\nAfter expelling energy around him (also dealing a lot of damage) to dissuade any attacks you might be trying to land, he'll move forward with a quick 1-2 punch with alternating palm strikes, the second one dealing a massive amount of damage and projecting his strike with extended range. The rapidity of these attacks often ensures that if you try to dodge the first hit, you'll get slammed by the second, and even using Rock Solid will just send you toppling backward. In these instances, using Cloud Step or Immobilize can be beneficial to getting away from this move, but be ready for him to resume the attack after Immobilize ends.",
