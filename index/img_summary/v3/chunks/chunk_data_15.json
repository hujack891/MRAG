    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the equipment menu where the player can view and equip different Spirits. The highlighted Spirit is the \"Apramana Bat,\" which is categorized as an Epic item with high Qi cost. The Apramana Bat Spirit grants the player the ability to transform into the bat, allowing them to leap into the air to evade attacks and release freezing gusts that deal Frost Damage. This attack can potentially freeze the target if their Frost gauge is maxed. However, this Spirit does not provide any equipped effect."
