You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis.\nThe golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin.\n### Yaoguai Chief - Emerald-Armed Mantis\nZhu Bajie will be on the floor and pick up a mantis from the ground. It will hop inside Bajie's mouth, and you'll need to do the same to be able to fight the insect. You'll soon be transformed and literally entering the belly of the beast.\n\nNote! If you die here, you'll be automatically transported back to near Zhu Bajie. There's a nearby Mantis-Catching Swamp that can also be activated, just behind where Bajie stands against the tree. To get back inside him, approach him and talk to him.\n\nBecause the fight takes place inside Bajie's stomach, the area is limited. You'll find the mantis hacking and slashing away at the lining of Bajie's stomach, and it will soon turn its attention to you.",
