    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the video game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically within the Bitter Lake region during the Zodiac Village of the Painted Realm section. It shows a snowy landscape with a character approaching a traditional building, possibly preparing for a confrontation. The character is equipped with a staff and appears to be cautious, as indicated by the on-screen text warning, \"Don't... Don't get any closer!\" This suggests a tense moment, likely preceding or during the Boss Fight against Chen Loong, who uses lightning magic. The image serves to illustrate the game's environment and the strategic approach required in this part of the walkthrough."
