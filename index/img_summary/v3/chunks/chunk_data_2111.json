Taking double damage from any of his attacks is highly inadvisable, so make sure your Shock-Quelling Powder is on your quickbar for this fight.\nYellowbrow chiefly attacks with a large spiked mace while he holds his magic seedbag in the other hand. Be incredibly wary of his weapon, as it has the ability to change its shape, and he can extend the handle at will both in size, length, and flexibility.\n\nIf you see his foot rise as it crackles with electricity, you're better off staying back, as you can be knocked into the air of his stomp connects, which turns into a \"grab\" where he'll pierce you with his mace and slam you into the ground for a ton of damage. It's still possible to deflect the stomp with Rock Solid or rise above it with your Pillar Stance, but if you're not sure on the timing, just play it safe.",
