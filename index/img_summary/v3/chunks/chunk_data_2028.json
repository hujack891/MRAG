    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the video game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically showing the location where players can find the Mountain Patroller. The character is seen standing in a snowy environment at the base of a staircase leading to a temple, which aligns with the description in the metadata and preceding text. The character appears to be preparing to ascend the stairs, likely to engage in a battle with the Mountain Patroller as part of the game's early Chapter 3. The visual elements, including the snowy path and temple architecture, reinforce the context provided about the Frost-Clad Path and the impending fight."
