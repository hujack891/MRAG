The Tally is used in conjunction with the Sterness of Stone Key Item to unlock paths and doors, such as those near Sandgate Village and Windrest Gate Shrines. The setting features ancient, weathered architecture and a large stone gate, reinforcing the narrative's focus on exploration and progression through locked areas."
