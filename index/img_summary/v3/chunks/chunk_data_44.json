A strange human man with a giant gourd on his back will be reciting poetry and drawing with his back to you.\n\nAs you approach, he’ll ask if you’ve seen the nameless souls in your travels - referring to the green wisps floating about that only offer a small amount of Will as they fly away. The wise master will take your gourd and inscribe a blessing on it, allowing you to absorb wayward spirits. This will allow you to finally capture the floating green wisps to not only gain much more Will, but also slightly replenish your Gourd’s healing charges.\n\nEven more importantly, you’ll now find that certain enemies will leave behind departed Spirits that can be claimed, and allow you to temporarily transform into them to unleash a specific attack. Unlike the Red Waves spell, these Spirits can be equipped to a special slot, and will become charged as you fight and earn Qi. Once the bar is filled, you can then unleash their attack by holding the right trigger and then the left trigger (R2/RT + L2/LT).",

The setting includes a decorative element, possibly a shrine or altar, adorned with cherry blossoms, which aligns with the game's theme of cultivating spirits and absorbing wayward souls to gain abilities and replenish resources."
