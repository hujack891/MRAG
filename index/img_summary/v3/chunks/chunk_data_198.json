You can prepare to mitigate his attacks by making sure you've crafted the Loongscale Armor Set, are stocked up on Shock-Quelling Powder, and apply the Soak to your Gourd that increases shock resistance.\nWhile he's nowhere as strong as the other dragons you've faced, you don't want to get to cocky, or you may find his electric attacks peeling off more of your health than you can restore, even with Zhu Bajie helping out.\n### The Zodiac Village of the Painted Realm\n\nReturn to Chen Loong (who now stands outside the shack by the water), and deliver the pellet to him. The old dragon will be overjoyed at your gift, and in return will pass along The Ruyi Scroll to you. He'll proclaim that he now has the strength to unseal the Painted Realm, where he and his fellow deities will now reside -- and you're invited!",
