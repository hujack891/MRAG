That way is blocked by a tough looking new enemy, the Monk Supporter.\n## Mirrormere\nWhen at last you reach your destination and return to monkey form, you'll find yourself at the foot of the Mirrormere Shrine. The Keeper of the New West will bid you to plunder the small temple on the frozen lake to find the next Sense of the Great Sage.\nBefore you do that however, there's a couple things to check out before crossing the giant frozen lake.\n\nReturning to the Mirrormere Shrine, this time go left when facing the shore. There's a few more plants to harvest, but the bigger attraction here is a larger group of Frozen Corpses in a field leading to the shore. You'll need to rouse and defeat the entire group, and doing so will earn you an exclusive reward - the **Mani Band curio** , which can help you out when fighting frost-inflicting enemies.\n\nYou'll also find a small **Treasure Chest** nearby, and you can loot it for assorted items that may include a Mind Core and possibly Refined Iron Sand.",
