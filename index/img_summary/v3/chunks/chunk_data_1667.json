The caption at the bottom reads, \"The Painted Realm. A peaceful haven I built with my fellow deities.\" This scene likely represents a moment in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong\" where the player is introduced to the Painted Realm, a significant location that includes the Zodiac Village. The character holding the scroll might be guiding or informing the player about this new area, which is central to the game's progression and the upgrading of armor."
