    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the video game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the \"Webbed Hollow - Lower Hollow Walkthrough\" section titled \"Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie (Second Encounter).\" It shows an intense battle between the player character and the boss, Zhu Bajie, in a muddy, rocky environment. The player is engaged in combat, wielding a weapon against Zhu Bajie, who appears in a boar-like form. The on-screen instructions suggest using \"Light Attack 'Sprouting Spring'\" for consecutive slashes to build up focus and \"Heavy Attack 'Withering Winter'\" for heavier, more damaging moves. The health bar for Zhu Bajie is visible, indicating the ongoing boss fight's progress."
