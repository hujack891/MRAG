However, you'll only be able to access it in Chapter 5 after completing all the secret areas in the game. We'd recommend waiting until you've finished Chapter 6 of the game and beat it before you visit Mount Mei, due to it being a vital place to see for the secret ending of the game.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **How to Unlock Mount Mei**\n* **How to Enter Mount Mei from The Great Pagoda**\n* **Mount Mei**\n* Erlang, The Sacred Divinity\n* The Four Heavenly Kings\n* Erlang Shen\n## Mei-Jian Peak\nHere is where you'll need to get your gear together before you go up to the tip of the mountain, where you'll be entering a boss battle against a familiar face.\n### Erlang, The Sacred Divinity\n\nThis attack ends in a red, charged attack, which can be hard to dodge. Unfortunately, unless you're running Cloudstep, all you can do is learn the timings to run or dodge to escape these attacks. You can deflect the spears until he charges up to perform the full attack, but as soon as your staff stops spinning, start dodging. He'll hang for a moment once he's fully charged, and then dart toward you, but again, this is a move that seems like it has a delayed reaction.\n\nOn top of this, you'll start to see him dragging the long sword toward you quickly. Again, this requires fast dodging to avoid it colliding with you. The third time he does this, he will start to shoot lasers, and you'll need to dodge around 4 times to completely miss the attack.\n\nAs you enter into the last 25% of his health bar, you can approach the fight in the same way. Just focus on knocking his shield down one last time and following up with your heavy attacks, Immobilize, and if you have enough Mana, now is a good time to throw out Pluck of Many.\n\nWhen his health bar is depleted, Erlang will turn into a bird and fly off. The Destined One will follow, and you'll soon be clashing in the sky.\n\nErlang, the Sacred Divinity",
