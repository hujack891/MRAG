You'll find him halfway through the Bamboo Grove once you reach Snake Way.\n### Guangmou Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\nGuangmou is one of the more tricky fights you’ll have faced so far, relying on a variety of sneaky projectile attacks to keep you on the defensive and limit your ability to pursue him. Though he’s not technically a snake, you will find yourself in danger of being poisoned during this fight, so you may want to buy a few anti-poison medicine from the Shrine’s shop.\n\nThe good news is other than his poison spray, Guangmou doesn’t really have any melee attacks to defend himself at close range — other than a very slow repulsing explosion he needs to charge up by spinning while he gathers energy. Use this to your advantage by pressing your light attack combos whenever you close the gap, and if you have defeated the Wandering Wight, use its Spirit Attack to knock him down with a mighty headbutt to keep him from teleporting away.",
