While he has much in common with the other optional frog boss from Black Wind Mountain, he’s got a few new attacks you’ll need to prepare for.\n\nSeveral of its new electric attacks can deal a flurry of damage if you aren’t prepared to deal with them. The usual tell will be when the frog’s throat swells with electric energy.

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the mini-boss fight against Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw in *Black Myth: Wukong*, as described in the \"Sandgate Village Walkthrough\" under the \"Village Entrance\" section. The setting is a flooded pit, and the boss, a large electrified frog-like creature, is mid-attack, releasing glowing electric projectiles that scatter across the water. The player's character is visible in the foreground, evading the attack. The fight emphasizes the boss's unique electric abilities, which were highlighted in the preceding text."
