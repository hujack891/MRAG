You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive. You should also have the Loongwreathe or Kang-Jin Staff, and have a good set of spells equipped that compliment your attacks -- we reccomend Immobilize and Rock Solid, but you can also try using the Ring of Fire to buff yourself up in since the arena is small.\nThe Cyan Loong doesn't have a huge amount of attacks, but when they hit, they hit hard!\n\nExpect him to also utilize his sword slashes in simple 1 or 2 hit attacks, or use his lightning palm attack on its own. His sword swings aren't too fast, but they can blindside you if you aren't ready to break off your attacks or use up all your stamina.",
