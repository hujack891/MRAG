Two characters, one wielding a weapon, are positioned near the edge of the cliff, suggesting an exploration or combat scenario. A red arrow indicates the path forward, guiding players to ascend the rocky terrain. This visual aligns with the \"Height of Ember\" section of the *Woods of Ember Walkthrough*, specifically under \"Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones,\" where players are directed to navigate towards the cliff edge and explore further."
