The foreground features two characters: the player character (center-left) and the Pale-Axe Stalwart (right), who appears to be an ally. They are positioned near a dark, ruined structure. In the background, a large tree trunk extends outward, with a glowing green Wisp highlighted on it (circled). This Wisp is likely a collectible item mentioned in the walkthrough, accessible after defeating the boss and speaking with the Pale-Axe Stalwart. The setting is atmospheric, with rocky cliffs and dim lighting, emphasizing the game's dark fantasy aesthetic."
