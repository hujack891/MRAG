That way is blocked by a tough looking new enemy, the Monk Supporter.\n## Frost-Clad Path\n### Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Macaque Chief (First Encounter)\nYou can consider this one half of a real boss fight, since you won't actually defeat this miniboss here. Despite that, the Macaque Chief is not to be taken lightly. Many of his attacks inflict Frost, and if your bar fills, you'll have extremely reduced mobility and be unable to dodge many of his attacks. Plan ahead by crafting or buying Body-Warming Pills to offset this.\n\nTake the path straight first, and you'll find a supercharged Yaksha Patroller surrounded by a horde of Frozen Corpses, making this fight a lot harder than usual. Don't worry about conserving your power here -- let loose with your Pluck of Many and Spirit Transformations spells to even the odds as much as you can so you can take down all the extra enemies and then focus on whittling down the Patroller's health.",

It shows the player character, Wukong, navigating a snowy, narrow path adjacent to a wooden structure. The character is crouched, possibly indicating a stealth approach or preparation for an encounter. The red-dotted circle in the image likely highlights an important object or enemy ahead, relevant to the upcoming miniboss fight with the Macaque Chief. This visual aids players in identifying key elements in their environment as they progress through this challenging section of the game."
