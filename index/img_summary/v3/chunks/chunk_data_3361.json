This makes him a wily fighter, if a bit unorthodox.\nZhu Bajie prefers to attack with his special 9-pointed rake, and while it may look silly, it's absolutely dangerous. He can swing it in wide arcs in a few different ways, but he usually has a slow wind-up at first that you can dodge away from.\n\nOnce you're ready, head through the gate to join the party, and it seems your just in time to meet the not-so-lucky groom.",
