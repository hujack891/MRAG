The environment features a desolate path surrounded by ruined statues, burned trees, and scattered debris, suggesting a post-battle or hostile setting. A red marker highlights a point of interest, likely indicating an item or objective for the player to interact with, while an arrow points toward the direction of progression. This visual aligns with the preceding text, which describes navigating past enemies like Revenant Archers and Bull Sergeants in this area of the game. The image serves as a guide to orient players within the narrative and gameplay context of *Black Myth: Wukong*."
