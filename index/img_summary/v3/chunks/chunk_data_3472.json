    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game Black Myth: Wukong, specifically from the \"Upper Hollow\" section of the Webbed Hollow area in Chapter 4. The player character is seen standing in a dark, cavernous environment with web-like structures on the ground, holding a spear and facing towards a path leading to a shrine with glowing trails. The setting includes dilapidated buildings and eerie lighting, suggesting a mysterious and dangerous atmosphere. This image aligns with the preceding text describing the exploration of the Upper Hollow, where players can find a treasure chest containing a Cuo Jin-Yin Belt Hook Curio to help resist poison encountered in this area."
