This blood can be pretty dangerous too, as he’ll be able to create pools of it all around the arena, and even poison you with it, so make sure you’re stocked on a few antimiasma pills.\n\nWhen the fight begins, he’ll begin a loud cry, punctuated by slamming his staff into the ground that will cause several pools of blood to splash down all around him.
