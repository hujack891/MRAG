    "img_summary": "The image depicts a fantastical, beast-like cart with intricate details, set in a dark, rocky environment with glowing lava. This visual likely illustrates an element from the secret area described in Chapter 5, Section \"The Five Carts and Bishui Cave,\" of the document. The preceding text mentions Cloudnest Peak and a final boss, suggesting the image may represent a significant or mythical object encountered in this narrative."
