The player character is seen approaching a path leading to a shrine, with a large Buddha head statue partially buried in the ground. This location is significant as it is where players can find one of the six Buddha Statue Eyeballs needed to unlock the secret Yaoguai King boss fight, Shigandang. The image serves to illustrate the in-game environment and guide players on where to find the Buddha’s Eyeball."
