    "img_above_text": "# Ebon Flow\nEbon Flow is one of the Transformation Spells you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Focused on dodging and deflecting attacks to then follow those actions up with powerful attacks, Ebon Flow can easily be missed within The New West as it is a part of a long quest chain.\nThe spell allows you to transform into the Yin Tiger to ward off incoming blows by holding the sword horizontally, or dashing forward like a gale to close in on foes. Focus is then built up before transformation can be converted for use afterward. Ebon Flow's moveset is as follows:\n* **Light attack: Onslaught Blade - Raise the Great Iron Blade to strike the target, building up focus with each hit.** As Focus increases, enemies are more easily staggered with this series of attacks that raises your Great Iron Blade.\n* **Heavy attack: Rift Cleaver - Hold Heavy Attack to unleash a powerful cleave, deling massive damage.** The more Focus built up, the more devastating the damage becomes with this attack, which is a slow, powerful slam.\n* **Deflection: Blacksmith - Raise the blade to deflect assaults, build up Focus with each deflection, or dodge to switch to other moves.** This is one of the only defensive moves a Transformation Spell has, building Focus with each hit and allowing you to mitigate damage.\n## **Black Myth: Wukong Ebon Flow Location**\nAs mentioned, finding Ebon Flow is long-winded, consisting of multiple steps across locations. To find the Ebon Flow Transformation in Black Myth: Wukong, you will need to:\n* Save Xu Dog from Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw in Sandgate Village in Yellow Wind Ridge and unlock the Cellar Shrine in Crouching Tiger Temple\n* Continue through Yellow Wind Ridge and into The New West until you step off Turtle Island at Bitter Lake\n* Defeat Chen Loong to the left of the North Shore Shrine in The New West\n* Upon defeating him, obtain the pill he asks for from Xu Dog in the Cellar of the Crouching Tiger Tiger in Yellow Wind Ridge\n* Return to Chen Loong and enter the Zodiac Village upon obtaining the Ruyi Scroll from him\n* Talk with Yin Tiger in the Zodiac Realm and challenge him to a duel. Succeed to obtain Ebon Flow\nTo save Xu Dog, you will need to head through the cave, just next to the Village Entrance Shrine in Sandgate Village in Yellow Wind Ridge.\n\nOnce you have killed Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, talk to Xu Dog once again, and he will move to the Cellar location in Crouching Tiger Temple. This can only be accessed by interacting with the Tally in the Tiger Vanguard arena fight, and heading into the temple through the staircase that opens.\n\nYou will need to defeat the Tiger Vanguard and Stone Vanguard to obtain the Keeness of Tiger and Sterness of Stone in order to use the Tally. Both of these bosses are mandatory bosses within Yellow Wind Ridge.",
