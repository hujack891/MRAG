    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from the game Black Myth: Wukong, specifically from the equipment menu showing the Rat Archer Spirit. The Rat Archer Spirit is a rare item that players can equip to gain special abilities. It allows the player to transform into the Rat Archer and shoot multiple flaming arrows, dealing significant damage. Additionally, equipping this spirit reduces the stamina cost for the Staff Spin move, making it particularly useful in combat scenarios involving numerous archers. The image also includes a demo option to showcase the spirit's abilities in action."
