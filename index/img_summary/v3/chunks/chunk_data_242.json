    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character standing before a large, intricately carved Buddha statue embedded in a cliffside, with various smaller statues and architectural elements surrounding it. This scene is part of the Precept Corridor section in the Bitter Lake Walkthrough for the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" The character appears to be navigating towards a significant point in the game, likely the Buddha Statue mentioned in the text, which has an opening through its belly button leading to the next area, the Valley of Ecstasy."
