Despite the name, the Rat King of Flowing Sands is not your true target, and in reality you can complete this battle as soon as you defeat his son, the Second Rat Prince. However, if you choose to engage in regicide yourself, know that the prince will become enraged at the death of his father, and will gain a massive damage increase with empowered moves. But for all this risk, there is a reward — defeating the empowered Rat Prince will allow you to absorb his Spirit to use in attacks, which you **can’t gain otherwise**!\nWhen the battle begins, you’ll notice that the King wisely does not try to fight you up close. He’ll scurry behind his son and out of sight while the Second Rat Prince tries to hold your attention with massive swings from his spiked mace. The King can even burrow underground, creating a trail of flying dirt as he tries to evade you.\n\nIf you do want to do defeat the King but are worried about incurring the Prince’s wrath, a good idea is to attack the King whenever he’s exposed, but then focus your attention on taking the Prince’s health down to a manageable level so that when you defeat the King, the Prince can’t last long.",

The player character is engaged in combat with the Second Rat Prince, who wields a large spiked mace, while the King of Flowing Sands is visible in the background. The sandy battlefield reflects the chaotic nature of the encounter, with dirt flying as the combat unfolds. The health bars for both enemies are displayed at the bottom of the screen, emphasizing the dual-target nature of the fight. This visual aligns with the guide's description of the King avoiding direct confrontation while the Prince aggressively attacks."
