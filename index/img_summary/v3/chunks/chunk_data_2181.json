Finding opportunities to get your own attacks in can be difficult, but you'll need to resist the urge to jump in too early or you'll be hit and staggered multiple times.\nGiven his long sweeping swings, having backup from A Pluck of Many or Spirits that summon other allies won't work as well as they'll tend to get hit even if he's focusing all his attention on you.\n\nThis isn't all he's capable of, either. He can also run at you an let out a war cry as he swings his blade in a circle, and then chain it into a tornado of five spins, ending with a jumping slash attack that again is very hard to stay away from unless you can interrupt his attack with spells. Luckily, he'll end the attack with a long flourish, giving you time to get back at him.\n\nEven his single attack can deal big damage if you aren't ready for their relatively fast speed. He may feint his blade in an upward swing, before launching himself high into the air and crash down with an overhand swing.\n\nWatch his movements carefully to see if he goes back to his default positioning. If he comes out of the jump attack by pulling his blade around with him, he'll follow up with two spinning slashes that need to be avoided to deflected to stop him in his tracks.",
