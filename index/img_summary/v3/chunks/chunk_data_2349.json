You'll also be much stronger since the last time you met, so this fight may not even take a long.\n\nWhen you've depleted the Macaque Chief's health yet again, he'll retreat for a second time, but the Wise Master will ask that you hold off your pursuit. In exchange for staying put for a bit, he will impart to you the secret of his **Ring of Fire Spell**!\n\nMacaque Chief (Warding Temple)\n\nThis spell can be swapped out with Immobilize, providing a more defensive variant on temporarily neutralizing enemies. With it, you'll be able to create a small limited barrier for yourself, which can be essential when preparing for a tough fight and using consumables and heals, or removing chilling effects.",
