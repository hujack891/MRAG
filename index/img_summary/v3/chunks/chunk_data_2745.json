    "img_summary": "The image is a screenshot from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the Equipment menu under the Spirits section. It highlights the \"Spearbone\" spirit, which is classified as a rare spirit with a high Qi cost. The spirit's power, \"Evil Banisher,\" allows the player to take the form of Spearbone, using a tiger shield to ward off attacks and repel foes, followed by a shield bash that can stagger enemies and shake the ground. The equipped effect of this spirit slightly increases the player's damage reduction. The image also shows the player's current level, basic attributes, and resistances."
