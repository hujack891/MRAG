Below you'll find a guide for the Bitter Lake Region, including how to defeat Kang-Jin Star and the Cyan Loong on Turtle Island, and how to navigate the North Shore to unlock the Zodiac Village and defeat the Apramana Bat -- plus where to find the four Buddha Statues.\n*     * Yaoguai King - Kang-Jin Star\n* **Turtle Island**\n* Yaoguai King - Cyan Loong\n* **North Shore of the Bitter Lake**\n* Boss Fight - Chen Loong\n* Yaoguai Chief - Apramana Bat\n* **Precept Corridor**\nLeaving the Warding Temple where you learned the Ring of Fire Spell from the Ancient Master, you'll have to slide down a long slope to reach a mountaintop where a giant pair of cymbals have been wedged into a mountain peak.\n## Yoaguai King Boss Fight - Kang-Jin Star\nLike the other Kang-Jin, expect this fight to involve a heaping helping of electricity, and stock up accordingly on Shock-Quelling medicine, or you'll be taking a lot of damage. Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.\n\nEven when you get in close range to fight, she has a few close-range lightning attacks to deal with. One starts with another mantra \"Spin...\" causing her to slash at you with lightning sweeps in two quick attacks, before performing a third attack while yelling \"and flush!\" This third attack can take the form of a floating downward slash, or creating a cross slash in front of her that moves outward. Whichever it is, a Cloud Step can let you bypass her attack by dodging to the side and then hit her from the flank.",
