He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).\nAs mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses.\n\nSpeaking of deflecting, it you favor the Rock Solid spell, do be warned that the Hundred-Eyed Daoist has a particular distaste for the skill. After you successfully use it to deflect his attacks, there's a good chance that he'll notice the move and say he \"forbids\" as he burrows into the ground.",
