Unlike the other Spirits that cost Will and eventually a Knot of Voidness to upgrade, Baw-Li-Guhh-Yang requires Tadpoles. There are six frog bosses in Black Myth: Wukong, and each one yields a Tadpole when defeated.\n\n**There is one frog boss in each chapter.

    "img_below_text": "* **Tongue Whip**\n* Equipped Effect: Moderately reduces the Stamina cost for Jumps and Jump Attacks.\n\nBaw-Baw-Lang-Lang's Spirit allows you to embody one of five frogs, each with their own elemental attack. There is a poison frog, a thunder frog, a fire frog, an ice frog, and a stone frog. You won't know what frog you are going to get each time you use the move, but each frog has an excellent attack that deals a fair amount of damage. Channeling Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang also reduces the Stamina cost for Jumping, including Jump Attacks. The Jump Heavy Attack is a quick and effective way to land a strong hit, and this Spirit makes that move even less demanding.\n\nCheck out our other helpful Black Myth: Wukong guides!\n\n* How-To Guides\n* Key Items\n* Walkthrough",

It highlights the Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang Spirit, which is a mythical spirit that players can equip. The spirit has a high Qi cost and provides the ability \"Tongue Whip,\" allowing the player to assume the form of a random frog with various elemental attacks (lightning, mist, filth, flame, and roar). Additionally, it moderately reduces the stamina cost for jumps and jump attacks. The player's current level and basic attributes are also displayed on the right side of the screen."
