It is one of the most powerful Transformations you can find within the game's early chapters, thanks to its extremely strong heavy attacks.\nThe Spell allows you to transform into a wolf guai and inflict Scorch Bane on the enemy with each attack. Red Tides' moveset is as follows:\n* **Light Attack: Moon Dance - Continuously slash at the enemy building up Focus.** This is a fast flurry of swings with Red Tides' blade that can stun-lock an enemy and catch them off guard from behind.\n## Black Myth: Wukong Red Tides Location\nRed Tides can be obtained by defeating Guangzhi in Forest of Wolves - Outside the Forest area in Black Wind Mountain.

The setting includes a path leading to a traditional gate, surrounded by lush greenery and stone markers. The character appears to be collecting or interacting with an item called \"Will,\" as indicated by the on-screen display showing \"Will x23.\" This scene is likely part of the journey to obtain the Red Tides Transformation Spell by defeating the optional boss Guangzhi in the Forest of Wolves."
