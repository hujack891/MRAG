    "img_summary": "The image depicts a skill tree interface from a game, specifically focusing on the \"Endurance\" skill under the \"Foundation\" category. The skill description indicates that each talent level reduces the stamina cost of sprinting. The context from \"The Forest of Wolves\" document, particularly the \"Front Hills\" section, suggests that this skill upgrade is relevant after defeating enemies and harvesting resources, likely contributing to the player's progression and abilities in the game."
