The character, Yellowbrow, is shown in his gold-plated protection form, which makes him impervious to regular attacks. The image illustrates the intense combat scenario where the player must find strategic openings to use heavy attacks or focus points to stagger Yellowbrow and break through his defenses. This visual serves to complement the preceding text, which provides strategies for overcoming Yellowbrow's formidable gold form during the battle."
