It shows a rocky landscape with a large, menacing stone creature, the Flint Vanguard, standing amidst the terrain. The creature appears to be made of rocks with glowing red fissures, indicating its fiery nature. In the foreground, a character, presumably the player, is preparing to engage in battle with the boss. This image serves to illustrate the challenging encounter players will face in the Cooling Slope area of the game."
