    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, misty forest scene with a cicada prominently in the foreground, suggesting a transformation or ability to take on a cicada form. The text overlay reads, \"The cicada form may help you explore,\" indicating that this form is useful for navigating the forest. This aligns with the context from \"The Forest of Wolves\" document, specifically the \"Outside the Forest\" section, where the Keeper warns of upcoming dangers and suggests scouting ahead. The cicada form appears to be a tool for exploration and possibly evasion in the forest environment."
