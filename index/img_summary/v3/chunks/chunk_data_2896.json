    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic confrontation between two imposing figures in a snowy, mountainous landscape. One figure, seen from behind, appears to be a humanoid creature with a tail, possibly representing the Stone Monkey character. The other figure, facing the first, is larger and armored, likely representing Erlang Shen. This scene aligns with the context of a boss fight in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically during the Erlang Shen Boss Fight as described in the guide. The setting and characters suggest a pivotal moment in the narrative, emphasizing the epic nature of the encounter."
