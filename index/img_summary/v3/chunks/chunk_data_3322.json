    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat scene from the game *Black Myth: Wukong*, specifically within the \"Relief of the Fallen Loong\" section of the Webbed Hollow - Lower Hollow area. The player character, Wukong, is engaged in battle against a large, grotesque enemy wielding a weapon, while two other enemies are visible nearby, one emitting a green glow. The environment is dark and rocky, with web-like textures scattered across the ground, reflecting the underground cave setting described in the walkthrough. The image aligns with the narrative context of exploring the lower hollow and encountering enemies while progressing through the area."
