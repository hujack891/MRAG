    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the section \"Outside the Forest\" in the document titled \"The Forest of Wolves.\" A character, likely the Destined One, is seen leaving a shrine area and heading towards a forest path. The environment is lush and green, with stone markers and a small fire indicating a mystical or ritualistic setting. The character is equipped with a staff and appears ready for the challenges ahead, as suggested by the preceding text which mentions warnings from the Keeper and potential encounters with Wolf enemies and a Crow Diviner. The image serves to illustrate the transition from the shrine to the forest, emphasizing the readiness for upcoming battles and exploration."
