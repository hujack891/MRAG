The highlighted spirit, classified as \"Rare,\" provides the ability \"Mighty Release,\" which allows the player to take the form of the Rat Archer and unleash a volley of arrows, dealing multiple hits. This ability has a high Qi cost and also grants an equipped effect that reduces the stamina cost for the Staff Spin move. The interface includes options to equip the spirit, view its details, and watch a demonstration of its abilities."
