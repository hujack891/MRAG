    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the \"Squall Hideout\" section of the \"Fright Cliff Walkthrough\" in the game Black Myth: Wukong. It shows a character standing on a high wooden platform, with an arrow pointing downwards, indicating a direction or a point of interest below. This visual likely corresponds to the part of the guide where players are instructed to fight their way to the top of the stairs and deal with enemies to reach the giant statue head and obtain the Third Buddha’s Eyeball. The \"Will\" indicator in the HUD suggests the character's current status or resources."
