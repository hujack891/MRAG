    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic scene featuring a large, insect-like creature perched atop a rocky outcrop in a dark and misty mountainous landscape. The creature's silhouette is accentuated against an ominous sky filled with heavy clouds, creating a sense of foreboding and tension. This visual corresponds to the \"Yaoguai Chief - Feng-Tail General\" section of the *Foothills Walkthrough* document, where players are instructed to approach the creature as part of the narrative progression in Chapter 6 of *Black Myth: Wukong*. The image likely serves to illustrate the encounter with the Feng-Tail General, emphasizing its imposing presence and the atmospheric setting of the Verdant Path."
