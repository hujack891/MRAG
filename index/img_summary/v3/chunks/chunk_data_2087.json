Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n* Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n* Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-Void\nThe monk who killed the Fox Guai you encountered in the Forest of Felicity, Non-Void is one of the disciples of Yellowbrow, and has his own set of peculiar moves. While he doesn't deal elemental damage, he can be a hard target to pin down due to his ability to become non-corporeal, causing some of your attacks to pass right through him!\nThe key to defeating this foe is to learn his attacks, and more importantly learning which parts leave him vulnerable to counters, and when you won't able to hurt him. Whenever he becomes transparent, avoid using any moves like Immobilize as you'll just waste their cooldowns and mana.\n### Completing the Snow Fox Questline\n\nHead along the outer path past a Supporter Monk to a far building past the frozen waterfall. You can find a small gold pot at the base of the frozen falls here, but there are two Guardian Wolves overlooking it that you'll need to lure out and take care of first. Be wary you don't pull too far back down the frozen river and alert a Thunder Rhino Master on top of some rocks. After defeating them, open the pot to find a **Celestial Nonary Pill** to increase your stamina.\n\nThe New West Celestial Nonary Pill",
