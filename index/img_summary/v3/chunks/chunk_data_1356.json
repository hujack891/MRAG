    "img_summary": "The image depicts a rocky, lava-filled landscape with a red arrow pointing towards a specific area and a red dashed circle highlighting another spot. This visual guide is part of the \"Valley Entrance\" section of the \"Furnace Valley Walkthrough\" in Chapter 5 of Black: Myth Wukong. The preceding text mentions encountering and defeating a Flamling, which drops valuable Flame Ores needed for a secret boss later in the chapter. The image likely serves to direct players to the location of the Flamling and the Flame Ores within the fiery terrain."
