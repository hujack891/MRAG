    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, rocky landscape with glowing patches of molten lava, suggesting a volcanic or fiery environment. A character, possibly the Mother of Flamlings, is seen emerging from the ground, which aligns with the context provided in the \"Cooling Slope\" section of the \"Field of Fire Walkthrough.\" This scene likely represents the moment when the Mother of Flamlings is summoned after delivering Flame Ores, as described in the walkthrough. The image serves to visually illustrate the dramatic and hazardous setting of this boss encounter in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\""
