    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy mountainous landscape, likely part of the Bitter Lake region in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" as described in the Bitter Lake Walkthrough. The scene shows a character, possibly Wukong, navigating through the snow with a staff, suggesting preparation for the upcoming Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight against the Apramana Bat. This setting emphasizes the need for strategic planning, including using warming medicine and equipping items to counter frostbite, as mentioned in the preceding text. The image serves to illustrate the challenging environment players must traverse before engaging in the boss fight."
