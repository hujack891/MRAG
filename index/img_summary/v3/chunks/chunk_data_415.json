    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy landscape where a character approaches a large, lifeless creature lying at the base of a statue built into a cliff. This scene aligns with the description of Captain Void-Illusion's location in *Black Myth: Wukong*, specifically along the Road of Longevity in the Valley of Ecstasy. The statue and corpse suggest the narrative moment where players can interact with the body to claim the \"Spirit of Captain Void-Illusion,\" an important reward despite the absence of a boss fight."
