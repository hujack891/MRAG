Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.\n\nWhen appearing to float up above you, watch carefully if she summons an electrical imbued spike in her hand.

    "img_summary": "The image depicts the boss fight against Kang-Jin Star, a key encounter in the game set on Turtle Island during Chapter 3. The scene shows a snowy, rocky environment with Kang-Jin Star hovering mid-air, surrounded by glowing electrical projectiles, emphasizing her lightning-based attacks. The player character is positioned below, wielding a fiery weapon, preparing to engage. This visual aligns with the guide's description of Kang-Jin Star's combat style, which involves electricity-based attacks at various ranges. The image serves to illustrate the intensity and mechanics of the boss fight, reinforcing the need for preparation with Shock-Quelling medicine and strategic movement."
