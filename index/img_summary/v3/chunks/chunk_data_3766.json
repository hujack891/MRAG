Below you'll find a guide both for exploring the optional area of the Windrest Hamlet and the Tiger's Acolyte, as well as the final main boss fight against the Yellow Wind Sage.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Windrest Bridge**\n* **Windrest Hamlet**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Tiger's Acolyte\n* **Windseal Gate**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Gore-Eye Daoist\n* Yaoguai King - Yellow Wind Sage\nThe Yellow Wind Formation is the final sub-region you’ll need to explore in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong to reach the Chapter Boss, but also includes a large optional village area of Windrest, and several paths leading to the boss from sealed stone doors. With multiple entrances and exits to this area, we’ll start with the first Shrine on the other side of the Crouching Tiger Temple.\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Yellow Wind Sage\nThe final boss of Chapter 2 is a hulking rat who holds an incredible trident spear in one hand, while the other carries… a giant head? If you think this may limit his moves, you’re unfortunately in for a rude awakening. The Yellow Wind Sage has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, and is not only a deadly attacker, but a master of the Samadhi Winds — but more on that later.\nMake sure you're suitably prepared for the fight in the best ways possible: Craft a bunch of medicine to increase your damage absorption and max health, and allocate any Mind Cores you’ve found toward Celestial Medicine buffs. You should also have a full set of either the Galeguard or Insect armor fully crafted, as well as the Cloud-Patterened Stone Staff from defeating the optional Sihandang boss. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you’ve beaten the Chapter 2 Secret Boss and equipped the new Vessel, the Wind Tamer.\n\nHe can also create a glow in his hand before throwing it into the ground. He’ll then stab the spot with his spear, and cause a giant tremor all around him when he rips the spear out. The time it takes for this move is a bit lengthy, so if you’re feeling gutsy you can try to interrupt him with a big charged hit or Spirit Attack, Immobilize him, or even use the Pillar Stance charge attack to rise above the tremor and smack him after evading it.",
