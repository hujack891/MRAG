On this page, we'll detail what both of the endings mean for The Destined One.\n## Ending 2 - The (True) Secret Ending\nTo reveal the secret and true ending of the game, you'll need to travel to The Great Pagoda in Chapter 3 and unlock Mount Mei. You can find out more about how to unlock Mount Mei and the secret ending here.\nThis will see you face off against Erlang, The Sacred Divinity, The Four Heavenly Kings, and Erlang Shen. After winning the battle against them, you'll need to return to fight the Stone Monkey and The Great Sage's Broken Shell.\nYou'll see the exact same cutscene for this ending, where Wukong falls to his knees and loses the Six Senses from his body only for The Destined One to absorb them.\n\nAs The Old Monkey collects the golden crown from the water, he places it on top of The Destined One's head.

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a close-up of a character adorned in ornate armor, likely from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" This visual accompanies the explanation of the game's true secret ending, where the character Wukong undergoes a significant transformation after a series of battles and events. The image serves to illustrate the climactic moment described in the text, where Wukong loses the Six Senses, and The Destined One absorbs them, ultimately leading to The Destined One being placed inside the same rock where Wukong once waited."
