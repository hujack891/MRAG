    "img_summary": "The image depicts a combat encounter in *Black Myth: Wukong*, specifically the player's first fight against the Macaque Chief miniboss in the \"Frost-Clad Path\" section of the Snowhill Path area. The player character, wielding a fiery weapon, faces the Macaque Chief in a snowy field surrounded by rugged terrain and a large twisted tree. The HUD displays health bars, abilities, and consumables, emphasizing the game's action-focused gameplay. This scene aligns with the guide's description of the challenging miniboss fight, where players must manage Frost-inflicting attacks and prepare with Body-Warming Pills to counter mobility reduction."
