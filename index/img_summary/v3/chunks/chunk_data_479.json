You’ll want to have upgraded your staff after defeating the Whiteclad Noble to dish out more damage, and using the Wandering Wight’s Spirit on this guy can help tremendously.\n\nThe only thing you can do is beat Jinchi to the punch. Start sprinting around the arena the moment you spot a body, and use a single attack to defeat them and steal their health instead. You’ll have to race back and forth, so conserve your stamina by only using quick attacks before getting back to sprinting.\n\nOnce enough have been absorbed by either you or him, he’ll return to the ground and the fight will resume.",
