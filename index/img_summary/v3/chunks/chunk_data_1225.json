This Yaoguai King is a large hulking beast of a wolf that hits as hard as he is big. Luckily, for all his size, his attacks come with clear telegraphs to help you dodge and counter his moves.\n\nHe’ll usually start the fight with a big leaping strike, falling to the ground with one slash, and then quickly following up with a second slash from his other claw. Unfortunately, he’s a pretty evasive foe, and finding the right moments to counter attack can be tricky.",
