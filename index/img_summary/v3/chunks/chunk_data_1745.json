You must defeat this boss in order to free a friend from two giant cymbals embedded in the peak above Turtle Rock\n* **Rewards:** Loong Pearl, Mind Core\n## Where to Find Kang-Jin Star\nKang-Jin Star is a formidable and umissable boss you'll need to defeat to free Zhu Bajie from being imprisoned in a giant pair of cymbls. You can reach this boss by making your way through the Pagoda Realm and through the Temple of Warding and out the back to a large slope you can slide down onto Turtle Island.\n### Kang-Jin Star Boss Fight and Guide\nLike the other Kang-Jin, expect this fight to involve a heaping helping of electricity, and stock up accordingly on Shock-Quelling medicine, or you'll be taking a lot of damage. Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.\n\nEven when you get in close range to fight, she has a few close-range lightning attacks to deal with. One starts with another mantra \"Spin...\" causing her to slash at you with lightning sweeps in two quick attacks, before performing a third attack while yelling \"and flush!\" This third attack can take the form of a floating downward slash, or creating a cross slash in front of her that moves outward. Whichever it is, a Cloud Step can let you bypass her attack by dodging to the side and then hit her from the flank.",
