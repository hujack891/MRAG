That way is blocked by a tough looking new enemy, the Monk Supporter.\n\nHead up the stairs at the end of the path to reach a high ledge in the cave, and on the way down you'll meet another new enemy. These Cyan Bats like to cling to ceiling and drop down to ambush you. While they are way less durable than the Swift Bats of the Yellow Wind Ridge, they can dive at you with their spears, or send ice attack projectiles your way that will try to inflict you with frostbite.
