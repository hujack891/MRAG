She can lash out with her appendages, which will subtly shift into long blades but also give you a clue as to where her main attacks will come from. As you might expect, you'll also have to deal with dodging both poison and webbing, making mobility key to your survival.\n\nLuckily, these strands all count as projectiles that can be deflected, meaning you need only stand your ground and spin your staff to knock each webbing projectile away as it comes, letting you evade both getting stuck and taking damage all at once.\n\nRather annoyingly, while most attacks can be deflected with Rock Solid easily, they'll cause her to retreat backward by a good amount, and out of range or regular retaliations. It's better that you build up your Focus Points before trying to deflect her attack, and then immediately follow with a high powered heavy strike with your thrust or pillar stance to catch her as she retreats.",
