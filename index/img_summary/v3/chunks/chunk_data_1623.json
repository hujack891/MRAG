    "img_summary": "The image depicts a serene and ancient stone environment, featuring statues carved into the rock wall and a small stream leading to a bridge. This setting is likely related to the \"Man-in-Stone\" side quest in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" which players need to complete to unlock the Sobering Stone for purchase. The statues and the stream suggest a hidden or secret area, consistent with the quest's narrative of finding the Man-in-Stone near the Squall Hideout Keeper Shrine."
