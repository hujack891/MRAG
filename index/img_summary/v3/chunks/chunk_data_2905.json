The cave opens into a brighter area with a tall, ornate pillar surrounded by vegetation and rocky terrain. This visual aligns with the section \"How to Find the Stone Monkey\" in the document *The Stone Monkey*, illustrating the path described in the preceding text: moving through a cave toward a glowing lamp and a waterfall. The image serves as a visual aid for navigating the environment leading up to the Stone Monkey encounter."
