    "img_summary": "The image depicts Chen Loong, a dragon-like character from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" in a snowy mountainous setting. He appears to be in a moment of distress, as indicated by the caption at the bottom of the image, \"Only one of Xu Dog's resurrection pills can save me now.\" This scene likely occurs after the player defeats Chen Loong in a boss fight, as described in the \"Bitter Lake Walkthrough\" under the section \"Boss Fight - Chen Loong.\" The preceding text explains that Chen Loong is a lightning magic user and provides strategies for defeating him, while the image and caption suggest a narrative moment where Chen Loong acknowledges his defeat and seeks help."
