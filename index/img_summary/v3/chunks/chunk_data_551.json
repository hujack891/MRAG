Below you'll find a guide to accessing the mountain by defeating the Venom Daoist, and how to complete Hong Yi the Snake Guai's quest to defeat the Daoist Mi and Duskveil, as well as the formidable Scorpionlord.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* How to Access Purple Cloud Mountain\n* **Valley of Blooms**\n* **Bounds of Deity's Abode**\n* Yaoguai King - The Scorpionlord\n* **Petalfall Hamlet**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Daoist Mi\n* **Cloudnest Peak**\n* Yaoguai King - The Duskveil\nThis Chapter 4 Secret can only be accessed by finding and defeating the Venom Daoist in two different locations, and will transport you to a different location to fight a secret Yaoguai King and repair a Vessel that is instrumental in defeating the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master.\n## Valley of Blooms\nHead along the path to the right to reach the Valley of Blooms Shrine. As with previous Secret Areas, this one has its own separate shop where you can purchase things not found in the rest of the Webbed Hollow, which can help you toward crafting better weapons and armor:\nPurple Cloud Mountain Shrine Shop\n---\nTiger Subduing Pellets (x3) - 360 Will | Antimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will | |\nCold Iron Leaves (x2) - 900 Will | Fine Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will | Refined Iron Sand (x4) - 1200 Will | Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Will\nGentian (x5) - 90 Will | Tree Pearl (x3) - 180 Will | Jade Lotus (x3) - 90 Will | Snake-Head Mushroom (x3) - 120 Will\n\nThe Lushleaf is a tree spirit that attacks fairly slowly, either stomping down or swinging its head in wide arcs to hit you -- though it can also perform a surprisingly fast low sweeping kick.\n\nIf you notice it make a strange gesture with its hands, it will summon two smaller tree-like enemies to assist it that can also perform a variety of kicks, but have much less health.",
