Yellow Loong is the final of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n* Rewards: Golden Lining Transformation Spell, Sea-Supporting Tendon, Golden Carp Curio, Kun Steel, Loong Pearl, Mind Core, 6998 Experience, 5049 Will\n## Yellow Loong Boss Fight and Guide\nThe Yellow Loong is the last of the four Loong bosses, and rather appropriately, he's an incredibly challenging fight. In fact, you may want to attempt this optional fight later on, especially after you've completed the rest of Chapter 4 and gotten tougher armor sets and weapons before challenging him. While he doesn't have a huge moveset, the attacks he does can some fast, and when imbued with lightning can often kill you before you're able to react.\nIf you do challenge him early, you should really consider arming yourself to the teeth: Upgrade the Loongscale Armor to reduce shock duration, stock up on every medicine you can think of in addition to Shock-Quelling Powder, and ask the Xu Dog for extra pills that may include rare ones that give you boosts of health or damage increases. Such a powerful foe is deserving of your good consumables -- but you may want to practice a bit first before using them in battle.\n\nSpeaking of which, his other quick melee move will begin with a quick stab from the opposite end of his weapon (while turning his back to you) followed by an electric overhead slam. Don't get greedy, because he'll quickly pull his weapon out to swing it around for a big spinning arc that also extends a huge electric wave, which will shortly detonate with a bigger orange blast that you need to be well away from.",
