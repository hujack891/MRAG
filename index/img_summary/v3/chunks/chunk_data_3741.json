Below you'll find a guide both for exploring the optional area of the Windrest Hamlet and the Tiger's Acolyte, as well as the final main boss fight against the Yellow Wind Sage.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Windrest Bridge**\n* **Windrest Hamlet**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Tiger's Acolyte\n* **Windseal Gate**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Gore-Eye Daoist\n* Yaoguai King - Yellow Wind Sage\nThe Yellow Wind Formation is the final sub-region you’ll need to explore in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong to reach the Chapter Boss, but also includes a large optional village area of Windrest, and several paths leading to the boss from sealed stone doors. With multiple entrances and exits to this area, we’ll start with the first Shrine on the other side of the Crouching Tiger Temple.\n## Windseal Gate\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Gore-Eye Daoist\nThe Gore-Eye Daoist is not like most bosses you’ve faced, what with the creepy fleshy thing on his back full of eyeballs. This boss has a speciality - and it’s creating blood. Lots of it. This blood can be pretty dangerous too, as he’ll be able to create pools of it all around the arena, and even poison you with it, so make sure you’re stocked on a few antimiasma pills.\n\nThere’s many more ways he can create more blood pools, and not all of them look the same. Sometimes he’ll dance about and ring his staff, shooting them out in all directions and ending with a shockwave of bloody force you need to dodge.\n\nUp close, the Gore-Eye Daoist can only employ a few staff swings that don’t hit hard, and will regularly rely on his blood spells to keep you at bay.",
