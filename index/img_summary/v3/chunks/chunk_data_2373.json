    "img_summary": "The image depicts a character standing on a snow-covered rocky terrain, overlooking a path adjacent to a traditional pagoda-style building. This scene aligns with the \"Snow-Veiled Trail\" section of \"The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm,\" where the narrative describes deceptive paths and exploration opportunities. The character appears to be preparing for a journey or confrontation, possibly related to the upcoming encounter with a strong Abomination guarding a treasure chest, as mentioned in the preceding text."
