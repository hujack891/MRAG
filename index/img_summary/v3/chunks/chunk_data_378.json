    "img_summary": "The image depicts the aftermath of the Buddha's Right Hand boss fight from Chapter 4 of Black Myth Wukong, where the defeated creature's elongated arm forms a bridge across a chasm. This bridge allows the player to progress further in the game after defeating the boss, which is a crucial step to obtaining the Buddha's Right Hand Key Item. The image visually represents the narrative transition from the boss fight to the next stage of the adventure, emphasizing the eerie and formidable nature of the creature encountered in the Webbed Hollow."
