Below you'll find a guide for the final area of The Webbed Hollow, including how to track down the Violet Spider and defeat the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, as well as getting a rematch with the Venom Daoist to unlock a Secret Area, and finding the last Purple Talisman Altar.\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Mountain Trail**\n* **Forest of Ferocity**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Commander Beetle\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Fungiwoman\n* Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n* **Court of Illumination**\n* Boss Fight - Supreme Inspector\n* Yaoguai King - Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master\nAfter defeating the Violet Spider, you'll have to escape her spider swarm as she retreats, but luckily you'll be plucked to safety by the one Spider Sister that seems to be on your side.\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Battle - Commander Beetle\nThe Commander Beetle would be a fairly straightforward miniboss fight, if not for the six Sword Daoists he's currently training in the large courtyard where you'll find him just past the Forest of Ferocity. Unfortunately, these enemies will respawn until you defeat the Commander, so you won't be able to get him alone so easily.\n\nKnowing that the Daoists don't have a whole lot of heath, there are two things you have on your side: large area-of-effect Spirit Attacks, and your Pluck of Many Spell. The Pluck of Many is a great bet for disorienting the group as you attack, though results can vary, and you'll likely have to jump in an finish off a few Daoists yourself. One is even likely to drop the **Fruit of Dao Soak** for your Gourd!\n\nThis can get tricky, as the Commander Beetle won't just wait around patiently while you defeat his students. He can employ huge strikes that cleave the very ground in a line where he strikes, and if you aren't paying attention, you can usually get hit by the tremors before you know what's going on.\n\nTry to keep in view as much as possible while defeating the Daoists so you can prepare to dodge away from his moves.",
