Once he hits the ground, he'll use his own transformation attack to turn into a giant muddy carp, which will quickly roll forward to try and flatten you, but you can dodge under it with some timing.\n\nFight carefully, and take note of which of his rake attacks swing fast, vs the ones that take time to swing around to dodge at the right times, or have a focus point in reserve to use a Thrust Stance varied combo and get out of his attack range.\n\nOnce you take off half his health bar, things will get real messy fast. Zhu Bajie will go back to his roots, in a sense, and transform into a giant boar that just can't wait to roll around in the mud with you.",
