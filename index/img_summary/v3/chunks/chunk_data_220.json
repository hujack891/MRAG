    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the Bitter Lake region in the game Black Myth: Wukong, specifically during the Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight against the Apramana Bat. The player character is shown traversing a snowy landscape, equipped with a staff, and appears to be approaching a glowing green area on the ground, possibly related to the aftermath of the battle with the Apramana Bat. The environment suggests a cold setting, aligning with the need for warming medicine or frostbite-reducing equipment mentioned in the preceding text. The image captures the moment after the bat's defeat, as the player prepares to interact with the skull of the Serpent General, a narrative element that leads to the Turtle General mourning his fallen friend."
