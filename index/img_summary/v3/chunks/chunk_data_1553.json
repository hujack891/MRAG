The on-screen prompt \"RT Deliver\" suggests an interaction, likely tied to progressing the quest to obtain the **Skandha of Feeling**. This scene is part of Chapter 2, specifically in areas like Yellow Wind Ridge, Fright Cliff, or Rockrest Flat, and involves finding the secret boss Shigandang to unlock the item. The image visually supports the guide's instructions for locating this Skandha."
