With multiple entrances and exits to this area, we’ll start with the first Shrine on the other side of the Crouching Tiger Temple.\n## Windseal Gate\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Gore-Eye Daoist\nThe Gore-Eye Daoist is not like most bosses you’ve faced, what with the creepy fleshy thing on his back full of eyeballs. This boss has a speciality - and it’s creating blood. Lots of it. This blood can be pretty dangerous too, as he’ll be able to create pools of it all around the arena, and even poison you with it, so make sure you’re stocked on a few antimiasma pills.\n\nHe’ll have a few more wise words to impart (hinting at the existence of the Loong Scale we picked up in the Valley of Despair), and you can also find a Meditation Spot near him to gain one last free Skill Point.\n\nThe Grotto, Yellow Wind Meditation Spot",
