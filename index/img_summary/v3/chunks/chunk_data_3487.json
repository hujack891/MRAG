    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the video game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically within the \"Upper Hollow\" section of the Webbed Hollow area. It shows a character, possibly the player, facing off against a Dragonfly Guai, which is highlighted with a red marker. The setting is a dimly lit underground cave with web-like textures on the ground and walls, and two lit torches providing some illumination. This scene aligns with the guide's description of encountering the Dragonfly Guai in the Upper Hollow, emphasizing the need to prioritize this enemy due to its poisonous attacks. The image serves to visually represent the gameplay challenge described in the walkthrough."
