It shows the player character engaged in combat with the Earth Wolf, a yaoguai chief, in a desolate, rocky area with sparse vegetation and a pagoda in the background. The Earth Wolf is mid-air, seemingly in the middle of a leaping attack, while the player character is poised to respond. The image illustrates the intense and dynamic nature of the fight, highlighting the challenging attack patterns of the Earth Wolf."
