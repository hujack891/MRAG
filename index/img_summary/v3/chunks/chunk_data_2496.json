Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of Yellow Wind Ridge: Sandgate Village, as well as how to defeat its many bosses that include Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, the Earth Wolf, the King of Flowing Sands and his First and Second Rat Princes.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Village Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* Yaoguai Chief - Earth Wolf\n* Yaoguai Chief - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n* **Valley of Despair**\n* Yaoguai Chief - First Prince of Flowing Sands\n## Village Entrance\nMake sure to take the time to view the new additions to the Chapter 2’s Shrines menu. Note that you can still freely fast travel back to any Shrine in Chapter 1’s Black Wind Mountain if you missed out on any secrets.

While he has much in common with the other optional frog boss from Black Wind Mountain, he’s got a few new attacks you’ll need to prepare for.\n\nInstead, stay out of their range and look for a small hilltop altar to the right that holds a chest, and you can find 3x **Tiny Piece of Gold** and 2x **Silk** inside.\n\nJust beyond the chest, you can spot another large open plain. Head to the right and down the hill onto a long wooden walkway, where you’ll find a path leading back to where the Xu Dog was, and a green Wisp to grab for its Will.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the \"Sandgate Village Walkthrough\" section. It shows an intense battle between the player character and an enemy, likely the mini-boss Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, in a dry, rocky landscape. The context suggests this is part of the \"Village Entrance\" area where players encounter various challenges and bosses. The player appears to be engaging in combat, indicated by the action-oriented posture and the visible health bar of the enemy. The image serves to illustrate the type of encounters players can expect in this part of the game."
