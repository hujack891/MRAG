The Soak's ability is rather specialised, useful for specific spell builds or when adopting a particular playstyle, over some of the other Soaks, which have a more general use.\nWith the Copper Pill Soak equipped, after using the gourd, the next Rock Solid cast costs no mana for a short duration. If you are using the Rock Solid spell, then this can be an incredibly useful addition to your build, giving you free uses of the spell, without needing to refill your mana as much. However, if you are not using the spell, then other Soaks will be more worthwhile.\n## Black Myth: Wukong Copper Pill Location\nThe Copper Pill Soak can be found by a statue on the hill after the Tiger Vanguard fight at Crouching Tiger Temple \\- Temple Entrance in Yellow Wind Ridge. Simply follow the hill and inside a small box on the Shrine, you can find the Soak.\n\nSoaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd.
