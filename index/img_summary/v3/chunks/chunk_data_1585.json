A lone wolf guards a wooden bridge in a dense, atmospheric forest setting, with a red arrow indicating the direction players should take after crossing the bridge. This visual aids the guide's instructions for locating Bell 1, as described in the section titled \"Bell 1\" of the document *How to Unlock the Chapter 1 Secret Area*."
