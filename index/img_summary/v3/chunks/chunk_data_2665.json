It shows a character standing in front of a temple entrance, possibly indicating the location where players can find the Keeper's Shrine and use the Snow Fox Brush to transform into fox form. The red arrow suggests a direction or path to follow, aligning with the narrative of navigating the temple area after dealing with a boss encounter. This scene is part of the \"Returning to Fox Form\" sub-section, emphasizing the transformation mechanics within the questline."
