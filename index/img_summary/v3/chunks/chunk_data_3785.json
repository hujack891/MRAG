If you think this may limit his moves, you’re unfortunately in for a rude awakening. The Yellow Wind Sage has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, and is not only a deadly attacker, but a master of the Samadhi Winds — but more on that later.\nMake sure you're suitably prepared for the fight in the best ways possible: Craft a bunch of medicine to increase your damage absorption and max health, and allocate any Mind Cores you’ve found toward Celestial Medicine buffs. You should also have a full set of either the Galeguard or Insect armor fully crafted, as well as the Cloud-Patterened Stone Staff from defeating the optional Sihandang boss. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you’ve beaten the Chapter 2 Secret Boss and equipped the new Vessel, the Wind Tamer.\n\nIn this new phase, he’ll have a few new moves to contend with, and they can get pretty nasty. He has a lot more kicking and stomping attacks, often raising his foot for a moment or even jumping off the ground to hang low to the ground, and then bringing it down hard. If his hand or foot begin to glow, it often means he’ll raise up more spears soon after, so be ready.",
