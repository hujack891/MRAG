As you might expect, he can deal a lot of damage with poisonous roots much like the lesser Ginsengling, so having antimiasma medicine on hand is a good strategy.\nMany of the Old Ginseng Guai's attacks are slow and hard-hitting, and the guai himself moves at a fairly slow pace, making him the perfect target for hit and run attacks as needed.\n\nBy far his biggest and most threatening move comes when he plants his hand in the ground to grow an increase area of poison roots all around him. The range on this is fairly big, and he'll continue to grow it for some time, giving you a few options: stay well away and heal up, or climb onto your staff (with a full stamina bar) and wait it out.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the \"Valley of Ecstasy Walkthrough\" section titled \"Towers of Karma.\" It shows a battle with the miniboss \"Old Ginseng Guai,\" who is known for using poisonous roots as an attack. The environment is snowy, with twisted roots covering the ground, indicating the miniboss's ability to spread poison. The player's character is engaged in combat, utilizing a staff, which aligns with the strategy of hit-and-run attacks recommended in the walkthrough. The image serves to illustrate the miniboss encounter described in the guide."
