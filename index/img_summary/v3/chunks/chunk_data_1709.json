He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often).\nAs mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses.\n\nHis most common attack comes when he spreads his hands wide as they glow yellow. He'll lunge toward you, bringing up both hands to create a giant tremor in front of him, but it can be deflected with Rock Solid (he'll no longer burrow to retaliate so that's one less thing to worry about).",
