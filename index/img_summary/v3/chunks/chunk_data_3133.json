As you might expect, he can deal a lot of damage with poisonous roots much like the lesser Ginsengling, so having antimiasma medicine on hand is a good strategy.\nMany of the Old Ginseng Guai's attacks are slow and hard-hitting, and the guai himself moves at a fairly slow pace, making him the perfect target for hit and run attacks as needed.\n\nIf he winds up his hand to slam it down into the ground, he'll sneakily send roots your way, which he can use to lock you down and make you unable to flee from his next attack or if you're already stuck in some poison -- but using the Pillar Stance can help you evade his binds.",
