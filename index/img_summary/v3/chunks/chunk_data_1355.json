    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, rocky landscape with two large, ornate pillars in the foreground. A red arrow points to a specific spot on the ground, suggesting an important location or item to be found there. This setting aligns with the \"Valley Entrance\" section of the \"Furnace Valley Walkthrough\" in the game \"Black: Myth Wukong.\" The preceding text mentions encountering Flamlings that drop Flame Ores, which are crucial for a secret boss later in the chapter. The image likely indicates a key area where players should focus their attention, possibly to find Flame Ores or face an enemy."
