The player character is seen facing Kang-Jin Star, who is wielding a glowing spear and surrounded by an ominous atmosphere. The health bar labeled \"Kang-Jin Star\" indicates the ongoing battle. This scene aligns with the walkthrough's guidance on preparing for Kang-Jin Star's lightning-based attacks and navigating the Bitter Lake region. The dark, mountainous backdrop adds to the tense and foreboding mood of the encounter."
