This time, he only has two extra arms, but the same rules still apply for this fight -- at least part of it.\n\nOnce the Daoist is defeated for good, he'll impart a mysterious message, telling you to \"find the needle on Purple Cloud Mountain\". As he departs, he mural will form on the nearby wall, which you can now interact with to travel to **Chapter 4's Secret Area: Purple Cloud Mountain**. As with other Secret Areas, we recommend exploring it before you proceed to the final boss of this chapter, as it will be instrumental in helping to defeat the final boss of this area.\n\nVenom Daoist (Temple of Yellow Flowers)",
