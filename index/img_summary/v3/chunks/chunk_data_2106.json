Taking double damage from any of his attacks is highly inadvisable, so make sure your Shock-Quelling Powder is on your quickbar for this fight.\nYellowbrow chiefly attacks with a large spiked mace while he holds his magic seedbag in the other hand. Be incredibly wary of his weapon, as it has the ability to change its shape, and he can extend the handle at will both in size, length, and flexibility.\n\nAt range, he'll often swing his mace upward several times, sending electrical currents along the ground toward you. They aren't too bad to deal with, so long as you strafe to the side as you advance and avoid their paths.",
