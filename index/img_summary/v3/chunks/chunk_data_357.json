    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically showing a character standing on a wooden platform in the Squall Hideout area. The platform is surrounded by large pots and barrels, and the character appears to be approaching a Buddha statue, which is partially obscured. This scene corresponds to the guide's description of the second Buddha's Eyeball location, where players need to navigate the rafters and defeat Blazebones enemies to interact with the statue and obtain the item."
