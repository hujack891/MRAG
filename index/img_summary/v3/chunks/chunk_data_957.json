    "img_summary": "The image depicts a golden headband lying underwater, surrounded by rocks and debris. This visual likely represents a significant moment in the \"Bad\" Default Ending of the game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" as described in the section \"Ending 1 - The (Bad) Default Ending\" from the document \"Endings Explained.\" The preceding text explains that after defeating the final boss, Wukong collapses in the water, which aligns with the imagery of the headband submerged, symbolizing Wukong's defeat or demise."
