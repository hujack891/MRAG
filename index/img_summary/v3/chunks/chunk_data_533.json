    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dramatic scene set in a snowy, mountainous landscape with barren trees. A character is seen mid-air, surrounded by streaks of light, suggesting an intense action moment, possibly during a boss battle. This aligns with the preceding text, which describes a confrontation with Erlang, The Sacred Divinity at Mei-Jian Peak in the game \"Black Myth: Wukong.\" The image serves to illustrate the challenging and visually striking environment players will encounter during this part of the game."
