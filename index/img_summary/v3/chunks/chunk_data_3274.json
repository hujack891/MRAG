    "img_summary": "The image depicts a dark, rocky cave with a partially illuminated path leading to an exit that opens up to a lush, green mountainous area. The scene is likely part of the \"Return Path\" section in the \"Water Curtain Cave and Birthstone Walkthrough\" from the game Black Myth: Wukong. This area appears to be a transitional space where players navigate through a cave environment, possibly encountering challenges or enemies, as suggested by the preceding text mentioning Zhu Bajie transforming into a boar and causing chaos."
