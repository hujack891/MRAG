    "img_summary": "In the image, a character from the game \"Black Myth: Wukong\" is seen standing in front of a large Buddha statue in a snowy, mountainous area. This scene is part of the \"Precept Corridor\" section of the \"Bitter Lake Walkthrough\" document. The statue is significant to the narrative, as a monk previously mentioned that worshiping with true hearts might reveal hidden Buddhas, suggesting the importance of finding four Buddha statues in this area."
