The sandy environment suggests a desert-like setting, which aligns with the narrative context of the Yellow Wind Ridge. The image likely illustrates a moment in the battle where the player must avoid Fuban's leap attacks, as described in the preceding text. The presence of game interface elements, such as health bars and action icons, indicates active gameplay, emphasizing the strategic aspect of the boss fight."
