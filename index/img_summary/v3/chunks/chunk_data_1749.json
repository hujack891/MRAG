The Keeper of the Flaming Mountains is a master of deception and uses his Yin-Yang ability to produce more than just the Yin-Yang Fish in this showdown.\n## Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and Yin-Yang Fish Boss Fight and Guide\n### Missable Transformation Spell\nAs we mentioned earlier, at the start of Furnace Valley there is a dead cart. You need to pull the string and exhaust the dialogue from the horse guai Ma Tianba before you defeat him in this fight. Otherwise, you will miss out on the Dark Thunder Transformation Spell. Once you've beaten the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and the Yin-Yang Fish, return to the cart and pull the string to get the Transformation Spell.\n\nMa Tianba uses a whip and has his own health bar that resembles a normal enemy's health bar. The fight is fairly straightforward in this first phase, but as soon as you've defeated the horse guai, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains drops the Yin-Yang Fish into the water.\n\nThe giant creature soon emerges and will begin attacking. It has a variety of moves that you'll see it perform during the fight. But the main thing is now you should make use of all your spells and transformations that you saved from the first round.",
