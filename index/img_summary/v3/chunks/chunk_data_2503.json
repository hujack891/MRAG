While he has much in common with the other optional frog boss from Black Wind Mountain, he’s got a few new attacks you’ll need to prepare for.\n\nInstead, use Cloud Step to race past, and climb the hill to take out the archers and avoid the Soldier.",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the video game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically from the \"Sandgate Village Walkthrough\" section. It shows a character navigating through a desolate village area with dilapidated buildings and twisted trees, likely near the \"Village Entrance\" as mentioned in the metadata. The context suggests that this is part of the guide to defeating the mini-boss Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, a frog-like creature found in a flooded pit nearby. The character appears to be preparing for or engaging in combat, as indicated by the visible game interface elements and the character's stance."
