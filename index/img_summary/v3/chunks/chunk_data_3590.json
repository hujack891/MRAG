The setting features a barren, uneven terrain surrounded by towering basalt-like columns and eerie stone faces carved into the walls, creating a foreboding atmosphere. Key visual elements include a **red-marked area** on the right, likely indicating an objective or point of interest, and an **arrow pointing left**, suggesting the next path to follow. This image serves as a navigational aid for players to progress through the area after defeating the boss \"Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind\" and reaching the Keeper's Shrine mentioned in the preceding text."
