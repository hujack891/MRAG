The player character is positioned in the foreground, facing a wooden structure and a sealed building. A red circle highlights a specific point of interest, likely indicating the location of a **Treasure Chest** mentioned in the walkthrough. The environment features intricate details such as snow-covered terrain, ancient architecture, and decorative elements like bells. This scene is part of the lead-up to the Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight with the Macaque Chief.  \n\n**Purpose/Narrative Role:**  \nThe image serves as a visual guide to help players locate the Treasure Chest on the left side of the sealed building after defeating the Macaque Chief miniboss. It complements the walkthrough text by marking the chest's exact location and immersing players in the snowy, atmospheric setting of the Frost-Clad Path."
