Some contain enemies and will wriggle about as you approach, but it is sometimes possible to attack the cocoon fast enough to stop whatever is inside from emerging. The smaller cocoons don't have yaoguais within, but do provide Will when broken. Even better, this area is likely to give you up to three **Rice Cocoons** when breaking a random tiny cocoon, and one or more **Spine in the Sack Curios** when breaking slightly larger cocoons, so they're worth destroying as you progress!",

    "img_summary": "The image depicts a scene from the video game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" specifically within the \"Upper Hollow\" area of the \"Webbed Hollow\" section. The image shows a character standing in a dark, cavernous environment, preparing to confront a spider-like enemy near a burning cauldron. The surroundings are filled with webbing and various cocoons, some of which may contain enemies or items. This visual corresponds to the guide's description of navigating through the Upper Hollow, encountering cocoons, and dealing with enemies like the Venom Daoist."
