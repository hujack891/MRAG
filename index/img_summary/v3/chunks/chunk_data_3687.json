In fact, you may want to attempt this optional fight later on, especially after you've completed the rest of Chapter 4 and gotten tougher armor sets and weapons before challenging him. While he doesn't have a huge moveset, the attacks he does can some fast, and when imbued with lightning can often kill you before you're able to react.\nIf you do challenge him early, you should really consider arming yourself to the teeth: Upgrade the Loongscale Armor to reduce shock duration, stock up on every medicine you can think of in addition to Shock-Quelling Powder, and ask the Xu Dog for extra pills that may include rare ones that give you boosts of health or damage increases. Such a powerful foe is deserving of your good consumables -- but you may want to practice a bit first before using them in battle.\n\nWorse still, after dashing at you 2-3 times, he'll start alternating slams where he strikes the ground at your position with a huge lightning blast, rather than charging past you. This can also go on for several hits with different wind-up speeds, and when electrified, a single mistake can spell doom.\n\nThere is one caveat: The key to surviving this attack string is to stop it before it starts, and there are a few special ways to stop him:",
