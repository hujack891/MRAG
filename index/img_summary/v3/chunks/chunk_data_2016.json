    "img_summary": "The image depicts a snowy area at the Temple Entrance in *Black Myth: Wukong*, part of the walkthrough for the New Thunderclap Temple. The player character, Wukong, is crouched in the foreground, seemingly preparing to engage or avoid enemies. A monk is visible near a tree in the background, positioned as a potential threat. The red-circled area highlights another point of interest, possibly an enemy or an interactive object. This scene aligns with the preceding text's warning about hidden Supporter Monks lying in wait near the statue and patrolling enemies in the vicinity."
