    "img_summary": "The image depicts a silhouetted character standing at the entrance of a large, rocky cave, illuminated by sunlight streaming in from above. This scene is likely from the game \"Black Myth Wukong,\" specifically in Chapter 2's Yellow Wind Ridge, near the Sandgate Village. The character appears to be preparing to encounter the First Prince of Flowing Sands, an optional miniboss located in the Valley of Despair. The image sets the atmospheric tone for the upcoming battle and exploration within the cave."
