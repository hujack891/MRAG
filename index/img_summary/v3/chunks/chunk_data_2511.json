Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of Yellow Wind Ridge: Sandgate Village, as well as how to defeat its many bosses that include Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, the Earth Wolf, the King of Flowing Sands and his First and Second Rat Princes.\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Village Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* Yaoguai Chief - Earth Wolf\n* Yaoguai Chief - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n* **Valley of Despair**\n* Yaoguai Chief - First Prince of Flowing Sands\n## Village Entrance\nMake sure to take the time to view the new additions to the Chapter 2’s Shrines menu. Note that you can still freely fast travel back to any Shrine in Chapter 1’s Black Wind Mountain if you missed out on any secrets.

If you can evade this one, it will waste time looking around to find that it missed its grab, letting you get your hits in.\n\nHowever, if you get locked in the grab, you’ll be tossed up in the air and land right on its bony back and horns, taking major damage as it shakes you off. Watch for both of its paws to reach out to know when to dodge this move.",
