You'll need a a lot of armor to withstand his hits, and plenty of poison defense to boot, which means using the Gall Soak, and poison-resistant curios to help you out.\nIf you recall your fights with the three Scorpion Princes in the Webbed Hollow, you may find more than a few of the Scorpionlord's attacks familiar, but don't be lulled into thinking you have him figured out: all of his moves strike faster, hit harder, and will evolve into longer combos as the fight drags on. Much of this fight will be learning his basic combos early, but being ready to adapt when he tricks you with extended attacks when you may otherwise think you have an opening.\n\nAnother move he often follows up his initial combo with will start when you see him roll forward on the ground. He'll start rapidly spinning to send his tail whirling along the ground with him three times in quick succession, before rising up and slashing upward with his tail as he does.",
