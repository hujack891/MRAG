Unfortunately, these enemies will respawn until you defeat the Commander, so you won't be able to get him alone so easily.\n\nAside from this, he doesn't have too much else to worry about. As long as you can get rid of his students quickly, and react quickly whenever he swings the bigger sword, you can anticipate and retaliate against most of his moves. When he falls, he'll drop a Knot of Voidness, and you can claim his Commander Beetle Spirit.\n\nCommander Beetle\n\nBefore you leave this area and continue on the main path, be sure to check the building where the Commander Beetle was standing, and you'll find a small **Treasure Chest** box that holds the **Tablet of the Three Supremes Curio**.",
