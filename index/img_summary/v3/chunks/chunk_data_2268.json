He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks.\n\nBecause of the difficulty of this section (and that you may also be at half health from the chanting curse), we highly recommend using Cloud Step so at your decoy can draw fire for a large portion of this attack.\n\nAfter the four circles all emit their laser blasts, they'll float away from Captain Lotus-Vision to take up spots in each corner of the room. Each circle will emit a continuous laser that borders the room, and will slowly pan them around to cross over the floor and each other.",
