Though you can face him early on in Chapter 2 once you find the Loong Scales, it’s recommended you wait until you’ve completed Chapter 2 or even started Chapter 3 before taking him on.\n\nIn particular, it’s a good idea to stock up on medicine to increase your shock resistance, and buy the Thunderbolt Horn Soak from the Shen Monkey as well.",

In particular, he can use a large leaping slam to cause a sizable explosion you’ll need to avoid with a well-timed dodge. He’ll often end this slam by dragging his weapons around to his sides, so try to evade backwards or get around to his back before retaliating.\n\nHe also has a variety of melee swings - sometimes swinging both weapons in slow arcs to slam in the ground one after the other before a third and final electrical slam. Other times he’ll alternate slamming the ground with each weapon while it’s imbued on either side of his body.",
