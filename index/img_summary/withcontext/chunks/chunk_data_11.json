    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe Apramana Bat is an optional miniboss in Chapter 3 of *Black Myth: Wukong*. It is a larger, gold variant of the regular bats encountered earlier and can be found near the skeletal remains of the Snake General at the North Shore of Bitter Lake. Players must face it before entering the Valley of Ecstasy to avoid missing the fight. Rewards include Cold Iron Leaves, experience points, Will, and a Spirit item upon subsequent encounters.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts an intense combat scene between the player character and the Apramana Bat miniboss. The bat is in its gold form, signifying its defensive state, while the player wields a weapon mid-action. The snowy terrain and skeletal remains in the background match the described location near the Snake Generalâ€™s skull. Visual cues such as the health bar, combat abilities, and glowing effects emphasize the boss fight's challenging nature.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text provides tactical advice for fighting the Apramana Bat. Players are warned to avoid overconfidence when the bat turns completely gold, as it can deflect attacks and counter with a powerful wing slam. Strategies include deflecting its attack or dodging to the side before retaliating with a Spirit Attack."
