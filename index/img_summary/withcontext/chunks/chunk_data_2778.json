    "img_above_text": "# Supreme Gourd\n\nThe Supreme Gourd is the final, upgraded form of the Old Gourd in Black Myth: Wukong. It is the most powerful Gourd in the game and only available upon levelling the Old Gourd to its previous maximum of 9 uses at the Shen Monkey Vendor. This upgrade gives the Gourd a tenth use.\n\nIt is one of the only Mythical Gourds in the game. Additionally, as it is an upgrade of the basic Gourd you get in Black Wind Mountain, it doesn't have a unique effect, providing the basic healing rate displayed alongside your Drinks and Soaks of choice.\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Supreme Gourd Location\n\nThe Supreme Gourd can be obtained from Rakshasa Palace within the Flaming Mountains. Upon talking with the NPC here, you can interact with the fire to upgrade your Gourd (it will replace your Old Gourd in your inventory). As mentioned, you will need to have upgraded that Gourd at the Shen Monkey Vendor to its previous maximum of 9 uses using Luojia Fragrant Vines to be able to do this.",
