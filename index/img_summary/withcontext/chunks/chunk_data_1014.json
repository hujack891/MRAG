Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Ashen Pass III**\n- Boss Fight - Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n* **Cooling Slope**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n- Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\n* **Fallen Furnace Crater**\n- Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n- Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\n\nAfter defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the Yin-Yang Fish, and the Crimson-Silver Cart, you'll have climbed to the top of the Flaming Mountains and be closer to finding out where the Bull King is.\n\n\nThe gauntlet is almost over! As you continue on, there's a small gap on the left you can dart into and then it's onward toward the flames. When you approach, a cutscene will begin where you'll see the golden spiked ball go flying off the end of the cliff.\n\nAfter the cutscene, ignore Pingping running off, and turn back to where you came from. Remember the wall of flames? Head back there. Now that the ball is gone, it's safe to explore the area slowly and you'll find the flames have also disappeared. A path has been revealed, which is the Cooling Slope, and the next place we'll explore.\n\n## Cooling Slope\n\nAs you enter the Cooling Slope for the first time, there are two points of interest to take note of. Up ahead, there's a smattering of rocks. And to the left, there's a Luoija Fragrant Vine.\n\nIf you hug the rocks to the left, you can collect the Luoija Fragrant Vine safely, but be careful as a Searing-Fire will leap out at you as you get close to it.\n\nThen, you'll want to go over to that collection of rocks. When you approach, it will transform into your first miniboss of the region, which is the Flint Vanguard.\n\n\nTop Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top Spirit\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n\nWhenever you're close to the Flint Vanguard, it will go into combo punches. These are typical punches to the ground, and occasionally it will slam both arms down together. These can be dodged, and you'll be able to keep close to the Vanguard temporarily until pools of lava appear -- that's when you want to dash away.\n\nIt shifts to ranged attacks when you try to create distance, in the form of fireballs. This will just be a single shot each time, so it's easiest to dodge. It will also attempt to close the gap by flying over to you and smashing down.",
    "img_below_text": "When it starts to get enranged, it will slam its fists down and shake its head, sending out a barrage of fireballs. Run around when this occurs, to avoid as much of the fireballs as possible.\n\nGenerally, you want to stick close to the Vanguard, dodge the punches, and build up focus to perform heavy attacks. You can knock it over like this, where it will be on all fours, so you can target it while it's vulnerable.",

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text introduces the \"Cooling Slope\" section of the \"Field of Fire Walkthrough\" for *Black Myth: Wukong*. It describes the transition to this area after the removal of a golden spiked ball and the disappearance of flames blocking the path. Players are advised to explore the Cooling Slope, encountering points of interest such as rocks and a Luoija Fragrant Vine. The rocks transform into the first miniboss of the region, the Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts the Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard, a fiery miniboss encountered in the Cooling Slope area. The creature appears to be made of molten rock and flames, emphasizing its connection to the volcanic environment. The surrounding terrain is rugged and dark, with traces of glowing lava, reinforcing the hostile and fiery nature of the region.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text provides combat strategies for defeating the Flint Vanguard. It explains the boss's attack patterns, including ground punches, fireball attacks, and enraged barrages of fireballs. Players are advised to stay close, dodge its punches, and use heavy attacks to knock it down and exploit its vulnerable state."
