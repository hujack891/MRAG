    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text provides context for the encounter with the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains in \"The Emerald Hall\" section of the Furnace Valley Walkthrough. It describes the events leading up to the battle, including a cutscene where the protagonist transforms into a Cicada and witnesses a confrontation involving Pingping, Rakshasi (revealed to be Zhu Bajie), and the Keeper. The Keeper binds Pingping and prepares for combat, initiating the boss fight.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a visually striking and atmospheric scene, likely from the battle against the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains. Two figures are shown in a reflective, watery environment with muted lighting and towering structures in the background. One figure appears to be wielding a bow, while the other holds a melee weapon, suggesting combat readiness. The setting emphasizes a surreal and ominous tone, aligning with the narrative's climactic boss fight.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text elaborates on the mechanics of the boss fight with the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains. It describes his attacks, including white projectiles and the summoning of undead enemiesâ€”white revenants with clubs and black revenants with ranged attacks. The strategy involves prioritizing the black revenants to minimize damage before resuming the fight against the Keeper. At 30% health, Zhu Bajie exits, leaving the protagonist to finish the battle one-on-one."
