    "img_above_text": "# Luojia Fragrant Vine Locations\n\n**Luojia Fragrant Vines** are an item in Black Myth: Wukong that you can collect to increase the number of times you can use your Gourd before needing to refill it. More Gourd uses means more health in Black Myth: Wukong, so you will want to get your hands on each and every one of these vines.\n\nLuojia Fragrant Vines are often somewhat hidden or guarded by some sort of powerful foe. They look like long, draping vines dotted with small, golden berries. Keep reading to find out where to find all Luojia Fragrant Vines.\n\n* Black Wind Mountain Luojia Fragrant Vines\n* Yellow Wind Ridge Luojia Fragrant Vines\n* The New West Luojia Fragrant Vines\n* The Webbed Hollow Luojia Fragrant Vines\n* Flaming Mountains Luojia Fragrant Vines\n\nYou can use your Luojia Fragrant Vines at the Monkey’s shop in the Marsh of the White Mist.\n\n\nThe first Luojia Fragrant Vine in the game can be found amongst the bamboo just opposite the Marsh of the White Mist Keeper's Shrine.\n\n\nThe Windseal Gate Luojia Fragrant Vine can be found after defeating both the Stone Vanguard and Tiger Vanguard bosses. After defeating them, return to the area where you fought the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Price and place the Keenness of Tiger and Keenness of Stone items into the receptacle by the large stone door. Open the door, head down the hill and over the bridge to reach an open cave area with a statue carved into the rock face. The Vine is guarded by the Gore-Eye Daoist Spirit.\n\n\nTravel to the Longevity Road Keeper's Shrine and pan the camera left to find a path leading through the snow. Follow that path up a set of stairs, continuing through a wooden gate and up a second flight of stairs. The Luojia Fragrant Vine will be waiting on a tree straight ahead.\n\nAs you approach the tree you will be ambushed by two Falcon Fanmakers. Take them out to collect the Luojia Fragrant Vine.\n\n## The Webbed Hollow Luojia Fragrant Vines\n\nThe Webbed Hollow has four Luojia Fragrant Vines to find, one of which is in a secret area.\n\n\nThis Luojia Fragrant Vine can be found in the center of the settlement in the Middle of the Hollow. It is guarded by the Scorpion Prince, so take him down and absorb his Spirit before picking up the vine.\n\n\nThe Temple of the Yellow Flowers Luojia Fragrant Vine is accessible after defeating the Violet Spider in the Webbed Hollow. Follow the spiders up the hill after defeating the boss to find yourself near the trail leading to the Temple of the Yellow Flowers. The vine is hanging from the branches of a tree right at the start of the trail.\n\n\nThe Relief of the Fallen Loong is both difficult to find and reach. Start by defeating the Buddha's Right Hand. Run over the bridge it creates and drop to the platform below. Turn right and head over the rope bridge on the left. Make your way past the hanging webs over the next rope bridge and escape to the forest. The vine is hanging from a tree on the edge of the cliff.\n\nCast Cloud Step to sneak past the webs sacks!\n\n### Purple Mountain Luojia Fragrant Vine",

To reach this area, you must first defeat the Venom Daoist in the chamber to the right of the Pool of Shattered Jade Keeper's Shrine. From there, revisit him again in an empty room around the Temple of Yellow Flowers to unlock the secret area.\n\nOnce at the Purple Cloud Mountain, run up the hill and over the rope bridge to activate the first Keeper's Shrine in the area. Turn right instead of heading over the bridge and defeat the Verdant Glow Spirit that's guarding the vine.",
