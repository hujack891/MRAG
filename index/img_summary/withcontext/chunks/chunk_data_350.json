    "img_above_text": "# Bluebridge Romance\n\nBluebridge Romance is the third of the Black Myth: Wukong Drinks you will find in your playthrough. Located in the game's third location, each sip gives a solid healing boost and a nice extra buff to go along with it.\n\nThat extra buff is a moderate increase to your movement speed after drinking the Bluebridge Romance from one of the Gourds. Each sip will also heal you for 36% of your maximum health - a sizeable chunk. Overall, this is a great Drink to have, especially early on in the game.\n\nAs with all Drinks, the potency of this can be increased by finding the Awoken Wine Worm locations around the game's areas. Our page has all of their locations for you.\n\nYou can then use these special Crafting Materials to upgrade the Drink at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove within Black Wind Mountain. Each upgrade will provide a sizeable buff to your healing potential, but as you level the Drink up, more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed.\n\nThis carries over to New Game Plus too, as you can upgrade your Drinks even more, but once again more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed, so you will have to recollect them all in your New Game Plus run.\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Bluebridge Romance Location\n\nThe Bluebridge Romance Drink can be found in Chapter 3 - The New West. From the North Shore of the Bitter Lake Shrine in the Bitter Lake, follow the coast along the left. Eventually, you will pass through a red gate. Walk all the way to the back of the area to the house in the distance to find the Bluebridge Romance Drink sitting in on the side of the lake to the left of the house.",
