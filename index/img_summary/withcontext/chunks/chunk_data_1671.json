This will also happen when you're near the bosses, but now that you've collected the Loong Scales, you're ready to unlock some secret areas!\n\n\nGo toward it and through it to enter the secret Loong Claw Grove area to fight Red Loong.\n\n\nBeyond this enemy, you'll see a sandfall. Head toward it and you can interact with it to remove the sand and enter a secret area Hidden Loong Cavern, where you'll fight Black Loong.\n\n\nAs you approach the statue, it will come to life and you'll be thrown into a fight against Cyan Loong. When you've beaten him, a Treasure Chest will appear in the nearby waterfall, which contains Breath of Fire Soak and Mountain-Shaking Core. You'll also unlock the crafting recipe for the mythical Golden Loong Staff.\n\n## How to Find Yellow Loong - Chapter 4 Secret Boss\n\nWhen you get to the other side, continue on to the grassy area, then head to the left to go up the stairs.
