    "img_below_text": "Now that you've dropped down from the Upper Hollow using one of the two paths to reach the Shrine below, you'll find yourself in the large middle portion of the Hollow. Similar to the Upper Hollow, there's a few diverging paths -- some that lead to optional areas and bosses, and some that reconnect back to the main path down to the Lower Hollow.\n\nYou can look out among the cliffs to spy other large platforms in the distance, but the only way forward for the moment is by going right along a twisting root bridge.",
