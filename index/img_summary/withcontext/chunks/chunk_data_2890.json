    "img_above_text": "# The Four Heavenly Kings and Erlang Shen\n\nThe Four Heavenly Kings and Erlang Shen are optional secret bosses you can find by entering Chapter 3's Secret Area of Mount Mei in Black Myth: Wukong. You'll need to complete all chapters' secret areas and an elusive side quest to access the area, then take on the incredibly strong Erlang, The Sacred Divinity. Completing this Kaiju fight will allow you to unlock the game's secret ending.\n\n\nAfter crash landing back on Mount Mei, two giants will emerge. This is the Destined One's Stone Monkey form and Erlang Shen. When Erlang is thrown off into the distance, you'll be thrown into a fight against the Four Heavenly Kings.\n\n## The Four Heavenly Kings Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThankfully after a huge battle against Erlang, The Sacred Divinity, the fight against the Four Heavenly Kings is much more straightforward. They share one health bar between them, and in your Stone Monkey transformation, you can use Primal Punch as your light attack, Earthshatter Slam as your heavy attack (this attack also heals), and Rock Solid to deflect their hits.\n\nUse Rock Solid when it's available and when one of the four giants will launch themselves at you. Other than that, you'll just want to keep using Primal Punch to build up Focus. When you've built your points, use Earthshatter Slam.",
    "img_below_text": "About halfway through the fight, you'll also be able to start using Ice Bath. When you use the Ice Bath Spell, the Stone Monkey's arms will be covered in frost, and when you punch, you'll inflict frost damage.\n\nWhen the Four Heavenly Kings have been taken down, there's just one more giant to deal with, which is Erlang Shen.",
