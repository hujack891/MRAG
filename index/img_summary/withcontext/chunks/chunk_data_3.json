Though the game helps by limiting the skills trees you can first interact with, there is still a wide variety of skills to choose from. With so many choices, choosing which skills to unlock can be daunting, but our guide is designed to help you decide which skills to unlock.\n\n**Jump to:**\n\n* [How to Unlock Skills in Black Myth: Wukong](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#How_to_Unlock_Skills_in_Black_Myth:_Wukong)\n* [How to Understand the Early Game Skills Trees](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#How_to_Understand_the_Early_Game_Skills_Trees)\n* [How to Understand the Mid-to-Late Game Skills Trees](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#How_to_Understand_the_Mid-to-Late_Game_Skills_Trees)\n* [Best Foundation Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Foundation_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Staff Stances Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Staff_Stances_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Mysticism Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Mysticism_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Alteration Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Alteration_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Strand Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Strand_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Transformations Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Transformations_Skills_to_Unlock)\n\n\nSkills are divided into two categories: Abilities and Spells.
