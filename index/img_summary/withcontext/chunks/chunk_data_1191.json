You’ll also meet the owner of the voice on the wind - the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain.\n\nThis friendly guy will be your guide and mentor for this part of the world, and will bid you to set out in search of Guanyin Temple, which burned down long ago but has since been rebuilt - but not by human hands.

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces the gameplay mechanics and narrative elements of *The Forest of Wolves*. It describes the role of Shrines as checkpoints where players can rest, refill resources, and travel. The Keeper of Black Wind Mountain serves as a mentor, guiding players toward Guanyin Temple and gifting the Incense Trail Talisman, which allows teleportation to the last Shrine visited. The section transitions to combat encounters in the \"Front Hills,\" detailing enemies such as Wolf Guais, a Swordsworn, and a shielded Wolf Soldier, along with strategies for dodging and countering attacks.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a character crossing a bamboo bridge in a dense forest setting, consistent with the \"Front Hills\" section of *The Forest of Wolves*. The environment features lush greenery, rocky terrain, and a shrine-like structure, reinforcing the narrative's focus on exploration and combat in a natural, mystical world. The character appears ready for action, carrying a staff and moving cautiously, suggesting an imminent encounter or traversal challenge.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text describes the transition to a more open area beyond the bridge, allowing for exploration off the main path. While the game maintains a linear progression, these open sections provide opportunities to discover unique items and optional boss battles, enriching the player's experience."
