    "img_above_text": "# Temple of Yellow Flowers Walkthrough\n\nWhen you untangle yourself from the webbing, you'll find yourself high above the Webbed Hollow, on a mountain path leading to a large temple filled with Daoist martial artists.\n\n\nAfter grabbing the Treasure Chest they were guarding, head right past a third green Wisp, and through a small ravine guarded by several Daoists to reach a large forested area.\n\n\nFollow the pathway, and you'll find a set of stairs leading up to a large courtyard where a tough Yaoguai Chief is training a large group of Sword Daoists.\n\n\nBe sure to look for a smaller path off to the right as you climb, and you can spot a lone **Treasure Chest** hiding in an alcove.\n\n\nFollow the winding mountain trail up several stairs and avoiding other Worm Practitioners until you reach the very top. The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems.\n\n\nAs you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple. A long slope here will send you down to a large arena, and its here you'll have your second and final encounter with an old foe - the Venom Daoist.\n\n\nBefore you do, you should also head through the nearby gateway to find a large field with a giant tree in the middle. Off on the right, you can find a wooden ledge overlooking the mountains with a **Treasure Chest** full of random materials and a Soul Remigration Pill.\n\n\nHead back to the altar, and pluck what should be the fourth and final talisman. Before you can celebrate this act, a large winged monster with a hand for a face will appear to aggressively punish you for this deed!\n\n\nNow that you've done all there is to do here, you can return to rest at the Shrine, and head toward the large field to finally catch up to the Violet Spider and her master, the Hundred-Eyed Daoist.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master\n\nIf he instead lets his sword float around the talismans to become imbued with lightning, be ready for him to toss the sword directly at you with quick speed. You'll have a moment to close the distance and get some hits in, but be ready when you see him raise his arms wide and begin to spin around as he advances, as his sword will reappear in his hand to perform two quick downward slashes, and then imbue his sword for a final slash (but you can deflect the two earlier slashes to stagger him).",
    "img_below_text": "Speaking of deflecting, it you favor the Rock Solid spell, do be warned that the Hundred-Eyed Daoist has a particular distaste for the skill. After you successfully use it to deflect his attacks, there's a good chance that he'll notice the move and say he \"forbids\" as he burrows into the ground.",
