    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text outlines the progression of the walkthrough in the \"Foothills\" region, detailing encounters with optional bosses and key locations such as Keeper's Shrines and the golden tree. It sets the stage for the final main boss, the Emerald-Armed Mantis, which becomes accessible after defeating specific prior bosses. The golden tree is described as having fog with green speckles, signaling the start of the Emerald-Armed Mantis encounter.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the Emerald-Armed Mantis, a Yaoguai Chief boss, in its transformed state during the fight. The mantis is shown with glowing red blades, indicating the drastic shift in its attack behavior after its health drops to 70%. The dark, swamp-like environment with tangled roots and liquid reflects the ominous setting of the \"Mantis-Catching Swamp\" sub-section.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text explains the mantis' erratic movements after its transformation, emphasizing the importance of using tools like the Plantain Fan to immobilize and control its position for effective attacks. Strategies for managing its aerial maneuvers and maintaining combat advantage are also highlighted."
