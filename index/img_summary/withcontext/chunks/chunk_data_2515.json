    "img_above_text": "# Sandgate Village Walkthrough\n\nIn Black Myth Wukong’s second chapter, you’ll leave behind the forests of Black Wind Mountain for the dry sands of the Yellow Wind Ridge. An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n\nNow it’s time to finally open that door the Rat Captains were guarding. In the next scene, you’ll spot the next major boss fight: a tiny Rat King and his oversized son.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n\nThere’s one very important thing to get out of the way before discussing the rest of the fight. Despite the name, the Rat King of Flowing Sands is not your true target, and in reality you can complete this battle as soon as you defeat his son, the Second Rat Prince. However, if you choose to engage in regicide yourself, know that the prince will become enraged at the death of his father, and will gain a massive damage increase with empowered moves. But for all this risk, there is a reward — defeating the empowered Rat Prince will allow you to absorb his Spirit to use in attacks, which you **can’t gain otherwise**!\n\nWhen the battle begins, you’ll notice that the King wisely does not try to fight you up close. He’ll scurry behind his son and out of sight while the Second Rat Prince tries to hold your attention with massive swings from his spiked mace. The King can even burrow underground, creating a trail of flying dirt as he tries to evade you.",
    "img_below_text": "Left to his own devices, he’ll most often emerge to scurry up one of the five large stone pillars in this boss arena, and begin pelting you with rocks from afar. One or two rocks won’t be lethal, but he can soon start to hurl a ton your way and stagger you when you’re trying to survive against the Prince.",
