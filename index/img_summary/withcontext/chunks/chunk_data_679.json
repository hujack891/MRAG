    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text introduces the Cloudtreading Deer, a Yaoguai Chief encountered in Chapter 6 of *Black Myth: Wukong*. The boss fight consists of two phases, involving frost and poison mechanics. Players are guided to locate the deer under a lightning-struck red tree in a clearing, where the fight begins. The first phase includes avoiding blood pools and tracking blood orb projectiles, with Zhu Bajie joining in the second phase for assistance.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts the Cloudtreading Deer in a snowy clearing surrounded by rocky terrain. The ground is stained with large patches of blood, emphasizing the hazardous environment described in the boss fight. The deer appears skeletal and ominous, consistent with its role as a challenging enemy. The visual reinforces the context of the fight, highlighting the blood pools players must avoid during the encounter.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text provides strategies for the second phase of the fight, focusing on managing time spent in the poisonous blood pools and luring the deer out of them. Players are advised to attack the deer in ice-covered areas for safety and use the Wind Vessel item to temporarily incapacitate the boss."
