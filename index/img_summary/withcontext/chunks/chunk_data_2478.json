An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n## Village Entrance\n\nIn addition, you’ll also have access to crafting a new set of armor since defeating the Black Wind King: The Ebongold Set, which provides better defense and a few bonuses to using your Cloud Step. Also, with the Flame Ebongold from the boss himself, you can use it and other ingredients to craft the Wind Bear Staff!",
    "img_below_text": "Before heading into the village, it’s time to finally find a use for all those plant materials you’ve been gathering. Look just beyond the shrine for a small ditch running under a wooden bridge. You can explore the left side to find a sloping path up to a green Wisp to absorb, and where a mushroom is actually a Lingzhiling creature in disguise. Watch for its poisonous attacks, and kill it to earn a large variety of mushroom items. The ditch also leads below the town’s large gate, but aside from Fragrant Jade Flower to harvest, there’s not much else down here.",
