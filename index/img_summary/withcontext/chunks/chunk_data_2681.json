They only hit a few times in different spots, and usually at a fair distance from the boss, so pursuing it and keeping close is often the way to go.\n\nMuch of this fight is about patience and waiting for the right time to strike back, as you don't want to waste time swinging wildly when there's no hope of reaching the boss. Let them come to you, and look for the right moments with stationary claw swipes or tail slams to deflect with Rock Solid for a better chance to stagger them.",
