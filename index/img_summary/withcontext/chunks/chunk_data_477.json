Below you'll find a guide to accessing the temple with all three bell locations, and how to defeat the secret Yaoguai King boss, Elder Jinchi.\n\nThis Chapter 1 Secret can only be accessed by ringing three large bells found around Black Wind Mountain, and will transport you to a different location to fight the secret boss that possess a magical item that is instrumental in defeating the Black Wind King.\n\n\n* **Bamboo Grove** \\- Traveling through the very short region of the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll have to defeat a character boss, the Whiteclad Noble. Once he retreats, look for a path off to the left instead of heading straight into Black Wind Cave, and you’ll find a large plaza past the marsh where several Wolf Guai sit before a wolf that has been hung from a tree. Just beyond them is the final bell.\n\n\nActivate the shrine in the entrance plaza, and then be sure to look around this area before proceeding inside. Opposite the Shrine, look around the other withered tree for three nearby chests that hold lots of Will, 2 **Yarn** , 3 **Stone Spirit** , and **Guanyin’s Prayer Beads** arm gear.\n\nYou will also find that unlike the rest of Chapter 1, the Keeper's Shrine here sells a unique selection in the shop only purchasable at this Secret Area, and it's worth stocking up on the items since they're pretty rare for this point in the game:\n\n| Ancient Guanyin Temple Shrine Shop | Ancient Guanyin Temple Shrine Shop |\n| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| Evil Repelling Medicament (x2)     | Longevity Decoction (x2)           |\n| Silk (x2)                          | Yaoguai Core (x2)                  |\n\nNote - Before facing this boss, be sure to defeat the optional **Wandering Wight** that is found in the Forest of Wolves region of Black Wind Mountain if you haven’t faced him already. Not only does he share many attacks with this secret boss, but defeating this one will cause the Wandering Wight to disappear, and you will not be able to gain the Curio and Spirit that the Wight drops.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Battle - Elder Jinchi\n\nOnce Elder Jinchi reaches around half of his health, he’ll suddenly teleport away, reappearing in the middle of the arena and adopting a praying pose hovering too far up to reliably reach. All of the shambling bodies in the arena will be removed, but it’s when they start to reappear that you’ll need to be ready.\n\nIn this segment, the bodies will slowly walk toward Jinchi in the middle of the arena, appearing slowly at first, but soon swarming from all sides. If any of them reach a spot close to the center, they’ll be absorbed by Jinchi giving him part of his health bar back.",

Start sprinting around the arena the moment you spot a body, and use a single attack to defeat them and steal their health instead.

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces the Ancient Guanyin Temple as a secret area in Chapter 1 of *Black Myth: Wukong*. Accessing the temple requires ringing three bells scattered across Black Wind Mountain. Inside, players face the secret boss, Elder Jinchi, who holds a magical item crucial for defeating the Black Wind King. Preparations include defeating optional enemies like the Wandering Wight and purchasing rare items from the temple's shrine shop.\n\n---\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a gameplay moment from the boss battle against Elder Jinchi in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The player character is seen attacking shambling bodies in the arena, surrounded by glowing effects, while Elder Jinchi hovers in the background. The health bar at the bottom indicates the ongoing fight, emphasizing the mechanic where players must prevent the bodies from reaching Jinchi to stop him from regaining health.\n\n---\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text explains the strategy for this phase of the Elder Jinchi boss fight. Players must quickly eliminate the shambling bodies before they reach the center of the arena and restore Jinchi's health. Sprinting and using quick attacks are essential to conserve stamina and outpace the bodies. Once this phase concludes, Jinchi returns to the ground, and the fight resumes."
