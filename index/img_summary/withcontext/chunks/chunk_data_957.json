    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces the narrative of *Black Myth: Wukong*, focusing on Sun Wukong's defeat by Erlang and the Heavenly Kings, leading to his entrapment inside a rock. It sets up the concept of The Destined One, who must collect the Six Senses of the Great Sage to confront Wukong.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a dark, ethereal scene with a monkey-like figure seemingly trapped or suspended in a hazy, rock-like environment. This visual likely represents Sun Wukong's entrapment inside the rock, symbolizing his defeat and the culmination of the \"Bad Default Ending.\"\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text describes how The Old Monkey retrieves a golden crown from the water and places it on The Destined One's head. However, this action results in The Destined One becoming trapped inside the same rock as Wukong, reinforcing the cyclical and tragic nature of the \"Bad Default Ending.\""
