This one in particular has an impressive effect to negate the cost of Rock Solid when used soon after using the gourd.\n\n\nOpen the large gate the Rat Imperial Guard were posted at, and head through to the other side. Be sure to look to the right as you open the gate, and you’ll find a tree with glowing flowers on it.

However, a lone and imposing figure will block you as you try to cross the bridge.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Tiger’s Acolyte\n\nThis is actually a very opportune time to challenge the hidden Shiandang Yaoguai King boss in this same arena by putting the six Buddha Eyeballs in the large rock nearby — if you haven’t challenged him already.",
