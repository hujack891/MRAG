The first can be found in the chapter's secret area Secret: Ancient Guanyin Temple; the second, you'll find behind a waterfall, but only after collecting the Loong Scales from Chapter 2.\n\n\nTo access the secret version of the Ancient Guanyin Temple, you'll need to ring 3 bells that are guarded by 3 other bosses you'll encounter in Chapter 1. When you do this, you'll be automatically transported to the secret location, where you can fight Elder Jinchi. Defeating him grants you the Fireproof Mantle Vessel, which can be a huge help in this Chapter.\n\n## Red Loong",
