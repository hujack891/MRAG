As a hulking monster of rock, the Stone Vanguard employs lots of tremor attacks and huge shockwaves whenever it slams its giant front arms down — which is most of the time. Cloud Step can be very useful for getting out of the way of incoming leaps, and then blindsiding it from the side to stagger it off of its current attack.\n\n### Secret - Get Help from the Shigandang\n\nWhile the explosion and rocky spikes can be dodged with good timing — it’s also possible to negate the effect by using your charged Pillar Stance. When done at a reasonable distance, you’ll simply ignore the tremor below you, and can follow up with a charged strike that often staggers the monster. However, if you try to create a pillar too close to his hands, the explosion can send you tumbling, though it usually absorbs the damage.",
