In the next scene, you’ll spot the next major boss fight: a tiny Rat King and his oversized son.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n\nLeft to his own devices, he’ll most often emerge to scurry up one of the five large stone pillars in this boss arena, and begin pelting you with rocks from afar. One or two rocks won’t be lethal, but he can soon start to hurl a ton your way and stagger you when you’re trying to survive against the Prince.",
