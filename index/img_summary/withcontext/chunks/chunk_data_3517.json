Located at the end of the Bamboo Grove, he is not listed as a Yaoguai Boss, but is akin to a end-of-area Yaoguai King, and even has two boss phases you'll need to survive.\n\n* **Rewards:** Jade Fang, 3x Yarn, 1049 Experience, 688 Will\n\n\nAs a required boss, you can't miss running into this character when exploring Black Wind Mountain. You'll find him guarding the end of the Marsh of White Mist in the Bamboo Grove, past where you save and befriend the Shen Monkey that can upgrade your Gourd.\n\nYou'll find him at the bottom of the ramp across a large flooded marsh area lined with reeds.\n\n## Whiteclad Noble Boss Fight and Guide\n\nMany times he employs either the first half or the entire combo attack, he’ll wait a moment before readying his next move. Watch for him to pull his spear back as he twists his body, as after a brief delay he will swing his spear around in a circle spin that’s tough to dodge, as it creates a delayed watery shockwave circle further out. Because of this, you’ll want to dodge toward him, and not retreat into the shockwave.",

Dodge to the side and prepare for him to follow his spear, grabbing onto the embedded weapon and spin around it to launch himself at you once more feet first, and then one final lunge with his spear for a third and final strike.",
