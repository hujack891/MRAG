The Skandhas to collect are:\n\n* Chapter 1 - Skandha of Form\n* Chapter 2 - Skandha of Feeling\n* Chapter 3 - Skandha of Thought\n* Chapter 4 - Skanda of Choice\n\nSee our page on How to Find the Five Skandhas and Unlock a Secret Boss for detailed information on getting each of them.\n\n## Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",

This is where tapestries are hung after you've completed chapters of the game.\n\nHowever, there is a final spot that can be unlocked if you meet the right conditions. You'll need to finish the secret areas from each chapter by beating the final bosses in each one and finish the questline for the Green-Capped Martialist from Chapter 3.\n\nWhen you return to The Great Pagoda, a cutscene will play as you head toward the top of the room. You'll also unlock the secret area, which is Mount Mei. Waiting for you here, is Erlang, the Sacred Divinity.\n\nYou can head to Mount Mei as soon as you complete the secret areas and the Treasure Hunter quest. But we've included these bosses as part of Chapter 6, as we'd recommend completing the game first and then pressing CONTINUE, going to Mount Mei and beating the secret bosses there. Beating the final boss again after doing this will unlock the true ending of the game.",
