    "img_above_text": "# Worryfree Brew\n\nWorryfree Brew is one of the nine total Drinks in Black Myth: Wukong. It is found in the second half of the game, specifically within The Webbed Hollow.\n\nEach sip of the Worryfree Brew from your Gord will recover 24% of Maximum Health (one of the lower amounts of health recovery in the game). On top of that, when at critical health your health recovery will be massively increased, making the Gourd more effective. As such, this Gourd is better used when you are below 33% health and on your last legs. That way you can get the most out of it.\n\nAs with all Drinks in the game, the potency of this can be increased by finding the Awoken Wine Worm locations around the game's areas. Our wiki page has all of their locations for you.\n\nYou can use these special Crafting Materials to upgrade the Drink at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove within Black Wind Mountain. Each upgrade will provide a sizeable buff to your healing potential, but as you level the Drink up, more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed.\n\nThis carries over to New Game Plus too, as you can upgrade your Drinks even more, but once again more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed, so you will have to recollect them all in your New Game Plus run.\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Worryfree Brew Location\n\nWorryfree Bree can be found at The Webbed Hollow's The Verdure Bridge Shrine location. From the Shrine, continue deeper into the area, until you cross a small bridge just to the left of the Shrine. Drop down from this bridge and continue through the lower cave systems (following the flames).\n\nHead up the stairs on the left after a short while and follow the flames to the top of the hill.",
