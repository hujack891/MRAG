You'll find him just inside the Warding Temple, harassing the Wise Master until you intervene.\n\nAfter a second defeat, you'll face him one last time near the end of the chapter, in-between two bouts that you'll have with the end boss, Yellowbrow.\n\n* First Encounter\n* Second Encounter\n* Final Encounter\n\n### Macaque Chief Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nHe can also heave his blade around that will send his body spinning, attacking with two quick spinning slice attacks. Often times he'll end up holding the blade with his foot, and perform a final upward slash as he backflips, sending out another projectile slash.",
