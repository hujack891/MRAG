However during Chapter 2 in Yellow Wind Ridge you will be able to start using them, providing you complete a questline.\n\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Mind Core Locations\n\nBelow, you can find a list of all the Mind Core locations in the game's first two chapters:\n\n\nWhen you stumble upon a blue, glowing enemy and defeat them, you have a chance to get a Mind Core. They aren't as common as Blood of the Iron Bull's but these enemies do possess them occasionally. These enemies will also drop their Spirit for you to claim, so be sure to seek them out in our Spirit Locations guide.\n\n\n\n\nThe next Mind Core is an automatic reward, granted upon completing Chapter 1 - Black Wind Mountain. Once you defeat Black Bear Guai and exit the chapter mural, you will get it.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Mind Core Location 9\n\nThe next Mind Core is at the Windrest Hamlet in Yellow Sand Formation in Yellow Wind Ridge. This can be accessed from the Valley of Despair Shrine in Sandgate Village.\n\nWhen you reach the inner hamlet, you will come across a Spearbone on the bridge. Defeating it will give you a Mind Core.",
