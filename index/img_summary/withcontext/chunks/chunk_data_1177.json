    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text introduces the player to the role of Sun Wukong, the mythical Monkey King, who challenges the Court of Heaven. This leads to a confrontation with Erlang Shen, a divine warrior and the nephew of the Jade Emperor. The encounter serves as a tutorial boss fight, allowing players to familiarize themselves with the game’s controls and combat mechanics in a low-stakes environment.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a dramatic moment from the boss fight with Erlang Shen, titled \"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity.\" Erlang, wielding a spear, is shown mid-attack in a misty, ethereal setting, while Sun Wukong appears in a defensive or fallen position. The user interface elements, including ability icons and the boss's name, suggest this is an in-game combat scene designed to teach players the basics of movement, targeting, and attacking.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text elaborates on Erlang Shen’s combat style, describing his use of spear sweeps and thrusts, which give players opportunities to practice dodging. It emphasizes the importance of timing and evasion, as blocking is not an option in the game, reinforcing the tutorial nature of the encounter."
