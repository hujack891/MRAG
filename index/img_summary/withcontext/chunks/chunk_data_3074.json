Below you'll find a guide for the Valley of Ecstasy Region, including how to reach the valley itself by defeating Non-White, and exploring the different parts of the valley to uncover several Yaoguai Chiefs on the path to the New Thunderclap Temple, and completing the Treasure Hunter's Quest and the Pagoda Realm Prisoner's Quest by defeating the final Captain.\n\n- **Jump to a Section:**\n- **Mindfulness Cliff**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White (Round Two)\n- **Forest of Felicity**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- **Brook of Bliss**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Able\n- **Towers of Karma**\n- Yauoguai Chief - Old Ginseng Guai\n- **Longevity Road**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Captain Kalpa-Wave\n\nAfter you solved the monk's riddle by praying at four Buddha Statues in the Precept Corridor, you'll split up from Zhu Bajie and make your way into the belly button of a large Buddha statue along the cliffs, taking you up a narrow pathway and into the Mindfulness Cliff.\n\n\nFrom the Shrine, you'll find yourself at the edge of a large pit with a pathway spiraling around its edge.\n\nHowever, as you begin to head up the path around the pit, you'll be interrupted by the arrival of a jester-like figure who wants to wear your face.\n\n\nContinue taking the path back outside and up the cliffs to reach a large open area with an archway at the far end leading to a huge valley, and on the right you'll find Non-White at a Meditation Spot waiting for round two.\n\n\nBeyond this arena, you can head through an archway to see the giant titular Valley of Ecstasy below you. It's a one-way slide, and the region is about to get a whole lot bigger and confusing.\n\n\nBack at the Forest Shrine, look left from the main road to find two different passageways into a canyon. The passage before reaching the Shrine leads past a green Wisp you can absorb into a small pond where a new Frog Guai miniboss is waiting.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n\nWhile you've likely seen what a Frog boss can do with their extremely quick belly thrusts, rear kick attacks, and jump slashes, there's a lot of new tricks up this yaoguai chief's sleeve. Many of his moves, including his arm swipes that end with a slam, will now create a field of frost upon the frozen lake.",
