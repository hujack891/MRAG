However, it will appear as little more than an empty room, potentially with tapestries hanging already (depending on the secret areas you've found and cleared so far). The Great Pagoda is actually linked to a secret area that you can access after Chapter 5, so jump down to the information on Mount Mei, which you can find at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n* How to Open the Purple Seal Prison Doors in the Pagoda Realm\n\n\nThe prisoner in the cell in the Pagoda Realm can be accompanied by the body of a two-headed rat depending on your actions from Chapter 2. You'll need to have spoken to the Rat Guai trapped in a little building in Sandgate Village. If you do this, you'll find the body of the two-headed rat in the cell and be able to take the Ashen Slumber Transformation Spell from them when you finally unlock the seals.\n\n\nCaptain Lotus-Vision forms part of a larger questline in Black Myth: Wukong, that also involves the NPC in the sealed cell. There are actually four captains you can fight in this chapter; two of them are unmissable, but Captain Lotus-Vision and Captain Void-Illusion need to be found. When you have the souls of all four of them, you can return to the NPC in the cell and receive a unique weapon.\n\n## Cyan Loong",

Head for the water and listen out for the sound of the voice that speaks to you each time you're near a Loong boss. You'll see a stone statue of a dragon by the water, that will automatically turn into Cyan Loong as you approach it with the Loong Scales.\n\n### Relevant Guide Pages\n\n* How to Find Cyan Loong",
