    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces the Cloudtreading Deer, a Yaoguai Chief encountered in Chapter 6 of *Black Myth: Wukong*. The fight consists of two phases, involving frost and poison attacks. Players are advised to activate the Deer Sight Forest Keeper's Shrine and approach the lightning and red tree in the clearing to find the deer. To simplify the fight, equipping the Wind Tamer vessel is recommended to neutralize tornado attacks.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the Cloudtreading Deer, a large, frost-covered creature with imposing antlers, lying in a snowy clearing surrounded by scattered rocks and red-leaved trees. A player character appears near the deer, suggesting an ongoing or recently concluded boss fight. The setting aligns with the described location under the red tree, emphasizing the atmospheric and combat-focused nature of the encounter.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text provides strategies for fighting the Cloudtreading Deer without the Wind Tamer vessel. Players are advised to distance themselves from tornadoes and let the deer approach. Observing its movements helps anticipate its aerial attacks and ground slams. Dodging or jumping is crucial to avoid frost shockwaves, followed by aggressive counterattacks."
