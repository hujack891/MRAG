Inside is an Abomination in the corner, as well as an empowered Enslaved Yaksha you can defeat to gain the Enslaved Yaksha Spirit. Defeat them both and help yourself to a **Treasure Chest** in the corner full of materials.\n\n\nThe cell beyond will require you to have beaten Captain Lotus-Vision to unlock, and holds a **Treasure Chest** with materials in addition to the Wisp on the ledge, guarded by another Red-Haired Yaksha.\n\n\nFinally, wait until the distressing chants begin and curse you one last time, and a final Lantern Sentry on this level will appear nearby. If you defeat him (and have defeated all the other Lantern Sentries in the Pagoda Realm), he'll drop the **Auspicious Lantern Curio** , which allows you to trigger the \"chant-beguiling\" effect of this prison at will when using Cloud Step.\n\n\nAs you head back to the shrine before the next big boss fight, now is a good time to take stock on what you've gained thus far.\n\n* Be sure to spend all your will by cultivating chosen spirits, and crafting a strong weapon, either the Loongwreathe Staff if you've defeated both the Red Loong and Black Loong in Chapter 1 and 2, or the Kang-Jin Staff which can deal electric damage if you have the right skils unlocked for Punishing Downpour.\n* Travel back to the Shen Monkey and upgrade your Gourd's healing capabilities, and stock up on whatever new items he's selling.\n* Make sure to keep Cloud Step equipped over Rock Solid, as it'll be equally worthwhile for this boss as it was for the last.\n\nWhen you're ready, it's time to stop that awful chanting once and for all by heading into the pagoda itself.\n\n\nLike Captain Lotus-Vision, you'll also get The Spirit of Captain Wise-Voice that can't be cultivated. You can now step out through the opposite opening to exit this pagoda, and you can check the rim of the cliff to the left to find a **Treasure Chest** with materials inside.\n\n\nJust past him, you'll find a long stone staircase to ascend and chase the golden trail of a nearby Shrine. Grab the green Wisp as you make the climb, and at the end you'll find the next checkpoint.\n\n## Snow-Veiled Trail\n\nThe next area is a bit deceptive in its multiple paths when in reality the rest of the Pagoda Realm is fairly linear (and even quick) should you be interested in progressing as soon as possible.\n\nThe main path leads up a slope to the left of the Shrine, and then to a large rock-filled forested area further left that you can ignore if you keep on the main path up to the Warding Temple where the last boss of this area is.\n\nHowever, you can first explore a second short area off to the right from the Shrine leading downhill.",
