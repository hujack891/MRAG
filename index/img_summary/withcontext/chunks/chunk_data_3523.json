You'll find him guarding the end of the Marsh of White Mist in the Bamboo Grove, past where you save and befriend the Shen Monkey that can upgrade your Gourd.\n\nYou'll find him at the bottom of the ramp across a large flooded marsh area lined with reeds.\n\n## Whiteclad Noble Boss Fight and Guide\n\nIn addition to this, he can twirl his spear above his head, summoning water above it before slamming it down, sending a straight line of water right at you that you can dodge to the side to avoid.\n\nBeyond that, the rest of the second phase of this fight will come down to anticipating how his body twists before he unleashes his sweep attacks. Keep close and aggressive to dodge around to his sides, using your spells to amplify your attacks, and looking for the right moment to invoke your Spirit Attacks (the Wandering Wight is still a good choice when he’s stationary to flatten him).",
