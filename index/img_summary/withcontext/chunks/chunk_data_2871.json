    "img_above_text": "# The Duskveil\n\nThe Duskveil is an optional Yaoguai King boss fight that you can encounter in Chapter 4 of Black Myth Wukong. The cursed and undead remains of a celestial rooster guai, you can find this monster at the peak of the Purple Cloud Mountain, a secret area of the Webbed Hollow.\n\n* Rewards: Weaver's Needle Vessel, Duskveil's Horn, Kun Steel, Double-Combed Rooster Blood, Gold Tree Core, Mind Core, 3410 Experience, 2595 Will\n\n\nThe Duskveil is an optional Yaoguai King, though required to complete the region and return to the Temple of Yellow Flowers. It is highly recommended that you defeat both The Scorpionlord and Daoist Mi before taking on The Duskveil, as defeating it may cause them to disappear.\n\nTo reach Purple Cloud Mountain, you will have to defeat the Venom Daoist twice - both in the Upper Webbed Hollow, and in a side path outside the Temple of Yellow Flowers main area. This will unlock a mural allowing you to travel to this new area.\n\nOnce you reach the first main shrine at the Valley of Blooms, stick to the left side to find a path up to the Petalfall Village, and continue along either path up to reach the peak, where the main boss lies.\n\n## The Duskveil Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe Duskveil is a disfigured and undead creature that -- despite its strange appearance -- behaves like an overgrown rooster, using a variety of stomping or charge attacks, in addition to being able to fly up and out of reach. Though the boss has two phases, you may not have as much trouble as you did with The Scorpionlord, since you won't have to deal with poison, and their attacks are a bit easier to read and counter. Strangely enough, it also starts the fight at around 75% of its health, but it does have a second health bar waiting, so pacing yourself can be the key to this fight.",
    "img_below_text": "Some of The Duskveils attacks can seem unconventional, but once you understand their moves, avoiding them will get easier. At range, they can leap into the air and unsuccessfully flap their wings as they kick out their legs, only to slam down on the ground, and then roll wildly. This means you'll need to either dodge immediately if they are in range, or wait to dodge when they roll.",
