    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces the \"Squall Hideout\" section of the \"Fright Cliff Walkthrough.\" It describes a choice between two paths after resting at a Shrine: a darkened area to the left and a brighter path along the cliffs to the right. Players are advised to use strategic movement, such as Cloud Step, to avoid threats like the Pitstone and execute sneak attacks.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a player character navigating a dimly lit area, likely the darkened path described in the preceding text. The environment includes rocky terrain, a column, scattered pottery, and a scaffold structure. Green glowing orbs are visible in the distance, suggesting an interactable or collectible element, such as the green Wisp mentioned in the following text. The player's stance and weapon indicate readiness for combat or exploration.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text elaborates on the left path, describing a Bladebone enemy that attacks from an unreachable scaffold. Players can avoid the projectiles by ducking into a small room where they can absorb a green Wisp, which is likely represented by the glowing orbs in the image."
