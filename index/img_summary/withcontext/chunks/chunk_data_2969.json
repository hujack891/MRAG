To give you a helping hand, here are some things that Black Myth: Wukong doesn’t tell you.\n\n**Jump to:**\n\n* 1. Keepers Shrines Will Keep Expanding\n* 2. Always Speak to NPCs\n* 3. It’s Really Easy to Reset Your Skills\n* 4. Additional Combat Styles Can Be Unlocked in the Skills Menu\n* 5. You Can Pick Up Missed Spirits at Keepers Shrines\n* 6. There’s No Penalties for Dying\n* 7. Not All Items Are What They Appear to Be\n* 8. Look for Enemies With Blue Glowing Outlines\n* 9. It Pays to Backtrack\n* 10. Meditation Spots Grant Skill Points\n* 11. Heavy Attacks Work Differently\n* 12. Enter Photo Mode in Alternate Ways\n* 13. Get Permanent Upgrades with Celestial Medicines\n\n\nFinally, it's important to note that all the Keeper's Shrines in a chapter share the same wares in the Store menu, but the offerings will differ in the next chapter, so always stock up before heading to the next big area. The only exception are marked \"Secret Areas\" you can unlock in a chapter -- find a Shrine in these places and check their shop for items you won't find elsewhere!\n\n\nMost NPCs will remain in the area you find them, meaning you'll need to return to speak to them if they provide a service like selling goods or upgrading your Gourd. Other characters may show up in future chapters, provided you met them in previous chapters.\n\nBe sure to head back at the start of every new chapter to see if a merchant's stock has upgraded with new features!\n\n\nOnce you defeat a boss at the end of a chapter and earn one of the Six Relics of the Great Sage, you'll be given the option to awaken a single passive talent. These can also be reset in the Reignite the Sparks Menu, but you'll need to select the correct tab for Relics!\n\n\nEach Stance can be invested in to serve different purposes -- for example, only the Smash Stance can interrupt an enemy attack with a well-timed Varied Combo, provided you unlock the required skill. The Pillar Stance can allow you to gain height while charging your heavy attack, and even nullify ground-based attacks! Other stances can help attack enemies from a safe distance, or hit multiple enemies with wider area-of-effect attacks! If you're having trouble against a tough enemy, try out other stances!\n\n\nIf you ran into any Green Wisps early in Chapter 1 that only seemed to give a bit of Will before floating away, come back once you have the Gourd upgraded in the Bamboo Forest, and they can now be properly absorbed for much larger amounts of Will!\n\n### 6\\.
