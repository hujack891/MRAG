Focused on dodging and deflecting attacks to then follow those actions up with powerful attacks, Ebon Flow can easily be missed within The New West as it is a part of a long quest chain.\n\nThe spell allows you to transform into the Yin Tiger to ward off incoming blows by holding the sword horizontally, or dashing forward like a gale to close in on foes. Focus is then built up before transformation can be converted for use afterward. Ebon Flow's moveset is as follows:\n\n* **Light attack: Onslaught Blade - Raise the Great Iron Blade to strike the target, building up focus with each hit.** As Focus increases, enemies are more easily staggered with this series of attacks that raises your Great Iron Blade.\n* **Heavy attack: Rift Cleaver - Hold Heavy Attack to unleash a powerful cleave, deling massive damage.** The more Focus built up, the more devastating the damage becomes with this attack, which is a slow, powerful slam.\n* **Deflection: Blacksmith - Raise the blade to deflect assaults, build up Focus with each deflection, or dodge to switch to other moves.** This is one of the only defensive moves a Transformation Spell has, building Focus with each hit and allowing you to mitigate damage.\n\n## **Black Myth: Wukong Ebon Flow Location**\n\nBeneath Xu Dog you can find a small pond with Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, whom you will need to defeat.",
