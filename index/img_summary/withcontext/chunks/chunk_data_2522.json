In the next scene, you’ll spot the next major boss fight: a tiny Rat King and his oversized son.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n\nIf you hear him start to yell at a distance, be prepared for a charge attack that comes with a three hit smashing sweep attack, and wait until his final attack to retaliate with your own combo attack.",
