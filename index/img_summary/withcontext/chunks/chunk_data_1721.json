This water-based dragon is a fan of quick moves and tail whips to try and catch you off guard.\n\n\nAfter defeating the Supreme Celestial Inspector, you'll gain the Somersault Cloud ability. You'll start near the edge of the cliff, in the wide-open area of the Foothills. From the edge of the cliff, look straight down to see a pool of water. Go down and to the center of this water to fight our first optional boss, Jiao-Loong of Waves.\n\n## Jiao-Loong of Waves Boss Fight and Guides\n\nYou can generally stay close to this boss, but just watch out for its roar that will stun you for a few seconds. To combat Jiao-Loong of Waves, you'll want to use heavy attacks. It's not so steady on its feet, so you can easily knock it over or at least temporarily stun it. This will give you longer periods of time to give it a beatdown without interruption. If you use the Plantain Fan here, it'll be constantly knocked down on the floor, giving you even more time to attack.",
    "img_below_text": "When its health has been knocked down past the halfway mark, it will start to dive into the water where you won't be able to reach it. It will move underneath the surface to try and dive up and attack you. Look for where the water is rippling to work out where it'll emerge.",
