This character will teach you the art of crafting consumable medicine, and eventually allow you to invest in passive buffs.\n\n\nOnce you defeat this frog boss, he’ll drop the **Evil Repelling Medicament formula**. Return it to the Xu dog back outside the pit. Not only will he reward you with **2 Evil Repelling Medicament** for your trouble, but you’ll also unlock the ability to **create all sorts of consumables yourself** at any Shrine. With all the materials you’ve been harvesting, you can stock up on defensive, offensive, and status reducing consumables.\n\n## In the Crouching Tiger Temple Cellar\n\nFight your way through the tunnel to find a cave path leading outside to a steep one-way slope. Slide down the rest of the way, and you’ll come up to a Shrine for the **Crouching Tiger Temple’s Cellar**. In the far corner of the cellar, you’ll find a familiar friendly face - the Xu Dog you helped get medicine recipes for!\n\nTalk to him while he’s in front of his large furnace, and the Xu Dog will thank you for your help thus far with a Mind Core. He'll also teach you the art of **crafting your own Celestial Medicines** in addition to the Mortal Medicine consumables you’ve been creating.",
    "img_below_text": "Celestial Medicines are sort of like **passive buffs** you can apply by trading in **Mind Cores** , which can be found in a variety of places - both by defeating bosses and sometimes regular enemies, or in chests. The buffs range from the familiar ones like health/stamina/mana increases much like the Celestial Pills, but also other stats like Crit Chance or resistance to certain afflictions.\n\nThe best part of these new passive buffs is that you have the option to reset them like your Skill Tree, which will give you back all the Mind Cores you’ve used thus far, allowing you to come back and reallocate points to suit your needs.",
