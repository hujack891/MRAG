Despite the abundance of Armor and Gear sets in the game, Silk is a lot rarer and you will have to get through a decent chunk of the game to find more of it, or consistent supplies of it in the open world.",
    "img_below_text": "Below, you can find a breakdown of all the locations where Silk can be found throughout Black Myth: Wukong, the majority of which are in Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge and onwards.\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Silk Locations\n\nSilk in Black Myth: Wukong can be found and obtained in the following ways:\n\n* Defeating Elder Jinchi in the Secret: Ancient Guanyin Temple in Black Wind Mountain ( requires all three bells to be rung in Black Wind Mountain)\n* Purchased from the Shrine Store within the Secret: Ancient Guanyin Temple area in Black Wind Mountain ( requires all three bells to be rung in Black Wind Mountain)\n* Randomly dropped from Yaoguai Kings, Chiefs, and enemies\n* Defeat Rat enemies and Spearbones in Yellow Wind Ridge and onwards\n\nThese are the most common and easiest ways to get Silk throughout the game. The material can also be farmed from Rat enemies and Spearbones easily. However, you will naturally get more Silk as you progress through the game's chapters, particularly once you reach Chapter 3 - The New West. At this point, you will likely have more Silk than you need.",
