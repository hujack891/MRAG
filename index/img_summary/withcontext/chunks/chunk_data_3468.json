    "img_above_text": "# Webbed Hollow - Upper Hollow Walkthrough\n\nThe Webbed Hollow is the second main area of Black Myth: Wukong's Chapter 4, starting with the upper portion of the large underground cave system. Below you'll find a guide for the first upper area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find your first encounter with the Venom Daoist, and the different ways to reach The Verdure Bridge.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Upper Hollow**\n* **Pool of Shattered Jade**\n- Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nBefore following the golden trail of a nearby Shrine, look to the left of the bed and small chest to find a path leading to another larger **Treasure Chest** you can open to claim a **Cuo Jin-Yin Belt Hook Curio** , another item that can help resist all the poison you'll be encountering.\n\n## Upper Hollow\n\nHead back up the main path to find the Upper Hollow Shrine as you finally take in the breadth of this new region. Unlike the village above, this sprawling area just goes deeper and deeper underground, and is full of alternate pathways and twisting passages leading to the lower levels. Be sure to also check your weapons to craft a new Chitin Staff from defeating The Second Sister.",
    "img_below_text": "Note - You can actually warp back to the Zhu Estate in the previous area to find the village in a different light. From some reason it will be daylight when you return, and nearly all the enemies will be gone, save for a Lantern Holder that opened the door for you where you fought the Second Sister. Defeat this lone foe, and you'll be able to claim the Lantern Holder Spirit!\n\nThe Upper Hollow area consists of a small group of houses to the left, and a larger pathway to the right that rings around the level, providing multiple points to drop down to the lower level. The main path rings around to the right of the shrine, so we'll check out the other side first.",
