They aren't as common as Blood of the Iron Bull's but these enemies do possess them occasionally. These enemies will also drop their Spirit for you to claim, so be sure to seek them out in our Spirit Locations guide.\n\n\n\n\nThe next Mind Core is an automatic reward, granted upon completing Chapter 1 - Black Wind Mountain. Once you defeat Black Bear Guai and exit the chapter mural, you will get it.\n\n\n\n\n### Mind Core Location 8\n\nThe next Mind Core is also at the Rockrest Flat Shrine in Fright Cliff in Yellow Wind Ridge. This time, from the Shrine, go left and defeat the Stone Vanguard to get one.",
