Below you'll find a guide for the first upper area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find your first encounter with the Venom Daoist, and the different ways to reach The Verdure Bridge.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Upper Hollow**\n* **Pool of Shattered Jade**\n- Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nBefore following the golden trail of a nearby Shrine, look to the left of the bed and small chest to find a path leading to another larger **Treasure Chest** you can open to claim a **Cuo Jin-Yin Belt Hook Curio** , another item that can help resist all the poison you'll be encountering.\n\n## Upper Hollow\n\nReturning to the Upper Hollow Shrine, look for a small stone stair path up to the right past the shack, leading across to a large area brimming with assorted cocoons.",
    "img_below_text": "A note on cocoons: you'll encounter many of these throughout the Webbed Hollow, in various shapes and sizes. Some contain enemies and will wriggle about as you approach, but it is sometimes possible to attack the cocoon fast enough to stop whatever is inside from emerging. The smaller cocoons don't have yaoguais within, but do provide Will when broken. Even better, this area is likely to give you up to three **Rice Cocoons** when breaking a random tiny cocoon, and one or more **Spine in the Sack Curios** when breaking slightly larger cocoons, so they're worth destroying as you progress!",
