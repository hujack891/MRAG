More Gourd uses means more health in Black Myth: Wukong, so you will want to get your hands on each and every one of these vines.\n\nLuojia Fragrant Vines are often somewhat hidden or guarded by some sort of powerful foe. They look like long, draping vines dotted with small, golden berries.

After defeating them, return to the area where you fought the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Price and place the Keenness of Tiger and Keenness of Stone items into the receptacle by the large stone door. Open the door, head down the hill and over the bridge to reach an open cave area with a statue carved into the rock face. The Vine is guarded by the Gore-Eye Daoist Spirit.\n\n\nTravel to the Longevity Road Keeper's Shrine and pan the camera left to find a path leading through the snow. Follow that path up a set of stairs, continuing through a wooden gate and up a second flight of stairs. The Luojia Fragrant Vine will be waiting on a tree straight ahead.\n\nAs you approach the tree you will be ambushed by two Falcon Fanmakers. Take them out to collect the Luojia Fragrant Vine.\n\n\nThis Luojia Fragrant Vine is in the secret area in Chapter 4. To reach this area, you must first defeat the Venom Daoist in the chamber to the right of the Pool of Shattered Jade Keeper's Shrine. From there, revisit him again in an empty room around the Temple of Yellow Flowers to unlock the secret area.\n\nOnce at the Purple Cloud Mountain, run up the hill and over the rope bridge to activate the first Keeper's Shrine in the area.
