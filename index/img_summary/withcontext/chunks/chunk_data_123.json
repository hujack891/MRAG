    "img_above_text": "# Best Skills to Unlock\n\nThere are a huge number of skills to unlock in Black Myth Wukong, and it can be daunting to know where to begin. Though the game helps by limiting the skills trees you can first interact with, there is still a wide variety of skills to choose from. With so many choices, choosing which skills to unlock can be daunting, but our guide is designed to help you decide which skills to unlock.\n\n**Jump to:**\n\n* How to Unlock Skills in Black Myth: Wukong\n* How to Understand the Early Game Skills Trees\n* How to Understand the Mid-to-Late Game Skills Trees\n* Best Foundation Skills to Unlock\n* Best Staff Stances Skills to Unlock\n* Best Mysticism Skills to Unlock\n* Best Alteration Skills to Unlock\n* Best Strand Skills to Unlock\n* Best Transformations Skills to Unlock\n\n\nSkills are divided into two categories: Abilities and Spells. Abilities cover your Foundation skills and Staff Stances, while Spells cover Mysticism, Alterations, Strand, and Transformations.\n\n\nFinally, Mysticism is where you can control the first spell you’ll learn - Immobilize. This will improve the duration of the Immobilize effect, and allow you to cause more damage when attacking using this.\n\n## How to Understand the Mid-to-Late Game Skills Trees\n\nFinally, in the Strand menu, you'll find the spell A Pluck of Many, where you can send out multiple Duplicates to help you. The skills you can unlock here will increase the health of your Duplicates, along with their attack power, and more.\n\n\nAlong with the suggested skills, we'd suggest unlocking skills that will allow you to complete combos without interruption, with more attack power on finishers, and those that build focus quickly.\n\n\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Resolute Counterflow**|  Perform a Heavy Attack during a Light Attack combo to consume Focus Point and perform Resolute Strike.\n**Skyfall Strike**|  After Resolute Strike, perform another Heavy Attack consuming a Focus Point\n**Invigoration**|  Grants massive Focus when performing Resolute Strike\n**Exhilaration**|  Increases the Health recovery when consuming a Focus Point based on talent level\n**Versatility**|  Increases damage of Varied Combos\n\nThe skills you choose in this category will depend on your stance preference but we'd argue that Smash Stance is the best. With the suggested skills, you'll unlock a new Heavy Attack at the end of a Light Attack combo. Adding Invigoration to the chain of Resolute Counterflow and Skyfall Strike will ensure you're building plenty of focus while completing those combos.\n\nThe aim for the Staff Stances category is to get 20 points in there at least to eventually unlock Focus Attack IV and have 4 Focus Points you can build up at a time.\n\n\nLater on, you'll also earn Ring of Fire, which will help you recover quicker and can be used to protect against the cold. Skills like Raging Flames and Consolidation are worth unlocking here, to help you recover and build Focus simultaneously so you can jump back into the action as you exit the ring.\n\n### Best Alteration Skills to Unlock\n\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Concealed Observation**|  Critical Hit Chance after Unveiling Strike is increased by talent level (can stack up to 10 times)\n**Thunder Strike**|  When in Cloud Step, Unveiling Strike can be a charged Heavy Attack\n**Rock Mastery**|  Reduces the cooldown of the spell\n**Ironclad**|  Damage Reduction given after a Deflection\n**Bold Venture**|  Recover Mana when successfully Deflecting |\n\nAlteration consists of spells like Cloud Step and Rock Solid. For Cloud Step, we'd suggest focusing on skills such as Concealed Observation and Thunder Strike. These will increase the damage you can do when performing an Unveiling Strike, where you can take an enemy by surprise.",
    "img_below_text": "For Rock Solid, Rock Mastery, Ironclad, and Bold Venture are particularly useful. With this combination of skills, when you're successful at Deflecting, you can recover Mana quickly, and take less damage for a short amount of time. With the Mana recovery and the Rock Mastery reducing the cooldown of the spell, you can get more use of Rock Solid in fights.",
