    "img_above_text": "# New Thunderclap Temple Walkthrough\n\nThe New Thunderclap Temple is the final main region of Chapter 3 in The New West in Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n- Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\n\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\n\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n\n\nInside the side room, there's another large tree that a Supporter Monk is facing, but a Wolf Guardian will try to ambush you as you approach him. You can also find a Ginsengling around the tree roots by trying to harvest some Aged Ginseng.\n\nCarefully head through the open doorway into the side plaza, and look for a small alcove on the left for a green Wisp to absorb. However, once you begin to explore this area, a Yaoguai Chief will emerge from a nearby altar.\n\n\nThe large gateway at the end of this path is guarded by three Overseeing Monks, one apart from the others, but all can be lured away independently due to their short-range senses.\n\n\nAfter defeating them, you can spot a lone monk standing inside. This is the target of the Snow Fox's quest for revenge, and you can now use the Snow Fox Brush in your inventory to transform into The Fox, and step inside to trigger a cutscene (if you enter first you can speak to him, but transforming near the monk will instantly trigger the fight without a scene).\n\n\nOnce you've claimed the pill, hop up the other side of the frozen river to fight the Clay Vajra. Follow the path around the frozen river past where several Censor Holders are praying before a Dual-Blade Monk, and you'll find a **Treasure Chest** in front of a large stone monument near where the frozen river leads to the bridge you ran across earlier.\n\nNow you can return back to the Main Plaza, and this time head up past where you defeated the other Clay Vajra for its Spirit, and enter the last part of the temple.\n\n## Temple Inner Courtyard\n\nThe good news is there's a Shrine at the top of the last set of stairs, and you might be able to race upward and claim it, otherwise go all out in using all of your abilities -- like Pluck of Many -- to even the odds along with Transformations.",
