Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Ashen Pass III**\n- Boss Fight - Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n* **Cooling Slope**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n- Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\n* **Fallen Furnace Crater**\n- Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n- Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\n\nAfter defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the Yin-Yang Fish, and the Crimson-Silver Cart, you'll have climbed to the top of the Flaming Mountains and be closer to finding out where the Bull King is.\n\n\nThe gauntlet is almost over! As you continue on, there's a small gap on the left you can dart into and then it's onward toward the flames. When you approach, a cutscene will begin where you'll see the golden spiked ball go flying off the end of the cliff.\n\nAfter the cutscene, ignore Pingping running off, and turn back to where you came from. Remember the wall of flames? Head back there. Now that the ball is gone, it's safe to explore the area slowly and you'll find the flames have also disappeared. A path has been revealed, which is the Cooling Slope, and the next place we'll explore.\n\n## Cooling Slope\n\nAs you enter the Cooling Slope for the first time, there are two points of interest to take note of. Up ahead, there's a smattering of rocks. And to the left, there's a Luoija Fragrant Vine.\n\nIf you hug the rocks to the left, you can collect the Luoija Fragrant Vine safely, but be careful as a Searing-Fire will leap out at you as you get close to it.\n\nThen, you'll want to go over to that collection of rocks. When you approach, it will transform into your first miniboss of the region, which is the Flint Vanguard.\n\n\nTop Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top Spirit\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n\nAs you head into the next barren section, you may notice the glow of a treasure chest up ahead. Be warned that there are also little glowing patches leading up to, and inside the next clearing, and these are all Flamlings. Clear them out before you go over to the chest, where you can collect Refined Iron Sand from it.\n\nWhen you've looted the chest, go around to the other side of the rock. There will be an open clearing here, that looks like it's empty. Again, remove any Flamlings from the area, then go to the center of the clearing. Here you'll find a larger glowing patch.",

Thankfully, Flame Ores are dropped by Flamlings, so you'll hopefully have enough by this point to summon her immediately. Approach the glowing patch and deliver the Flame Ores.",

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces the \"Cooling Slope\" area in the \"Field of Fire Walkthrough\" for *Black Myth: Wukong*. It describes the initial exploration of the area, highlighting two key points of interest: a Luoija Fragrant Vine and a collection of rocks. The rocks are revealed to transform into the miniboss \"Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard,\" marking the first significant encounter in this region.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a barren, rocky clearing in the \"Cooling Slope\" area with a glowing patch of ground marked by a red arrow. This glowing patch is significant as it indicates the location where the miniboss \"Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\" can be encountered. The surrounding environment is desolate, with dark tones and sparse vegetation, emphasizing the hostile nature of the area.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text provides instructions for progressing after defeating the Flint Vanguard. It warns players about glowing patches in the next clearing, which are Flamlings that must be cleared before accessing a treasure chest containing Refined Iron Sand. Additionally, it introduces another glowing patch in the center of the clearing, where players can summon the miniboss \"Mother of Flamlings\" by offering 4x Flame Ores, which are dropped by Flamlings."
