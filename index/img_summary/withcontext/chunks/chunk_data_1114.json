Make your way into the center of the clearing, where Bajie will exclaim it's a dead end. However, you'll soon be joined by the Supreme Celestial Inspector. If you found all of the Purple Talismans in Chapter 4, then this will be a familiar face to you.\n\n\nWhen his health is down to the last third, he will cover the arena with a red haze, reducing the size of the arena that you'll fight the creature in.

Go down and to the center of this water to fight our first optional boss, Jiao-Loong of Waves.\n\n\nOn the opposite side of the water, there's a clearing, with what appears to be a big rock sitting by the edge of it. This is actually one of the Poison Chiefs in the area, so fly over to it to tackle your next miniboss.\n\n\nWhen the Poison Chief is down, fly up and continue left toward the water. Go almost to the end of the water, where you should see a giant creature. When you get close to it, it will leap in the air and jump to a nearby rock.
