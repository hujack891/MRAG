One such secret area is in Chapter 1 and requires ringing three bells to access it. On this page, you'll find information on how to find each of the three bells and what awaits you in the hidden temple.\n\n\nIf you've been exploring every part of Chapter 1 thoroughly, you’ll likely encounter two of the bells before you’re even told about them. That being said, you might not have rung them. It’s not until the fight with the Whiteclad Noble that you’ll hear a riddle and then be prompted to find the three bells. If you're not sure where to find them all, here's where you need to look:\n\n\n\n\nInstead, go to the left and through the small cave to find the final bell. It'll be at the end of the path, where a wolf hangs from the nearby tree.\n\n## How to Enter the Secret Area in Chapter 1\n\nWhen the fight is over, you'll be taken back to the bell that was near the Whiteclad Noble in the Marsh of the White Mist.",
