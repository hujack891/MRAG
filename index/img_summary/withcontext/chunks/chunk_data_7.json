Though the game helps by limiting the skills trees you can first interact with, there is still a wide variety of skills to choose from. With so many choices, choosing which skills to unlock can be daunting, but our guide is designed to help you decide which skills to unlock.\n\n**Jump to:**\n\n* [How to Unlock Skills in Black Myth: Wukong](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#How_to_Unlock_Skills_in_Black_Myth:_Wukong)\n* [How to Understand the Early Game Skills Trees](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#How_to_Understand_the_Early_Game_Skills_Trees)\n* [How to Understand the Mid-to-Late Game Skills Trees](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#How_to_Understand_the_Mid-to-Late_Game_Skills_Trees)\n* [Best Foundation Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Foundation_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Staff Stances Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Staff_Stances_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Mysticism Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Mysticism_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Alteration Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Alteration_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Strand Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Strand_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Transformations Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Transformations_Skills_to_Unlock)\n\n\nSkills are divided into two categories: Abilities and Spells. Abilities cover your Foundation skills and Staff Stances, while Spells cover Mysticism, Alterations, Strand, and Transformations.\n\n\nFinally, Mysticism is where you can control the first spell you’ll learn - Immobilize. This will improve the duration of the Immobilize effect, and allow you to cause more damage when attacking using this.\n\n## How to Understand the Mid-to-Late Game Skills Trees\n\nFinally, in the Strand menu, you'll find the spell A Pluck of Many, where you can send out multiple Duplicates to help you. The skills you can unlock here will increase the health of your Duplicates, along with their attack power, and more.\n\n\nAlong with the suggested skills, we'd suggest unlocking skills that will allow you to complete combos without interruption, with more attack power on finishers, and those that build focus quickly.\n\n\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Resolute Counterflow**|  Perform a Heavy Attack during a Light Attack combo to consume Focus Point and perform Resolute Strike.\n**Skyfall Strike**|  After Resolute Strike, perform another Heavy Attack consuming a Focus Point\n**Invigoration**|  Grants massive Focus when performing Resolute Strike\n**Exhilaration**|  Increases the Health recovery when consuming a Focus Point based on talent level\n**Versatility**|  Increases damage of Varied Combos\n\nThe skills you choose in this category will depend on your stance preference but we'd argue that Smash Stance is the best. With the suggested skills, you'll unlock a new Heavy Attack at the end of a Light Attack combo. Adding Invigoration to the chain of Resolute Counterflow and Skyfall Strike will ensure you're building plenty of focus while completing those combos.\n\nThe aim for the Staff Stances category is to get 20 points in there at least to eventually unlock Focus Attack IV and have 4 Focus Points you can build up at a time.\n\n\nLater on, you'll also earn Ring of Fire, which will help you recover quicker and can be used to protect against the cold. Skills like Raging Flames and Consolidation are worth unlocking here, to help you recover and build Focus simultaneously so you can jump back into the action as you exit the ring.\n\n\nFor Rock Solid, Rock Mastery, Ironclad, and Bold Venture are particularly useful. With this combination of skills, when you're successful at Deflecting, you can recover Mana quickly, and take less damage for a short amount of time. With the Mana recovery and the Rock Mastery reducing the cooldown of the spell, you can get more use of Rock Solid in fights.\n\n\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Harmony**|  Gain Focus for each attack by Duplicates\n**Volition**|  Duplicates can use other spells like Ring of Fire, Rock Solid, and Immobilize\n\nYou'll want to spend Sparks increasing the duration, health, and attack power of your Duplicates first and then try to make them as useful as possible.\n\nTo do this, we'd suggest getting Harmoy and Volition. This will allow them the freedom to perform spells and have an effect on enemies, and also grant you Focus while they attack.\n\n### Best Transformations Skills to Unlock\n\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Moon Roam**|  Damage is increased after a Perfect Dodge\n**Evergreen**|  Might decay is reduced\n**Ferocious Form**|  Attack is increased while Transformed\n\nTransformations add some spice to combat and can be hugely beneficial, especially as they have completely different health and status bars to your character.",
    "img_below_text": "When you're transformed, you want the Transformation to last as long as possible and deal as much damage as you can. The combination of Moon Roam, Evergreen, and Ferocious Form will allow you to do just that.\n\nIf you want to spend additional Sparks in this category, Might Reserve will let you keep some Might when you transform back into primate form and Hidden Might increases your max Might level.",
