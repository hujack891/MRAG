    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text describes the progression of the Bitter Lake Walkthrough, where the player encounters various characters and bosses, including Zhu Bajie and Chen Loong. After delivering a pellet to Chen Loong, the dragon unseals the Painted Realm, inviting the player to explore the Zodiac Village. The walkthrough emphasizes the importance of specific items and upgrades, such as the Golden Loong Staff, and sets the stage for further exploration along the lakeshore.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a snowy lakeshore environment with rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. A player character, wielding a glowing staff, is navigating the area, with visible game interface elements such as health, abilities, and an on-screen prompt suggesting exploration (\"By my keen eye, ford the stream, and we'll surely find something interesting\"). The setting aligns with the narrative's description of the lakeshore near the Zodiac Village, suggesting this is part of the exploration phase following the encounter with Chen Loong.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text instructs the player to continue exploring the lakeshore from the North Shore Shrine, encountering skeletal remains scattered along the beach. This sets up the next stage of the walkthrough, hinting at further discoveries and challenges in the Bitter Lake region."
