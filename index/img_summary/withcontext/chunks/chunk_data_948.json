    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe Emerald-Armed Mantis is a significant boss in Chapter 6 of *Black Myth: Wukong*. Players must defeat other Yaoguai Chiefs and locate a golden tree surrounded by fog to trigger the fight. The battle begins after a cutscene where the player enters Zhu Bajie's stomach to confront the mantis.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the Emerald-Armed Mantis, a towering, green, insect-like creature with sharp, blade-like limbs, standing in a dark, organic environment resembling the interior of a creature's body. In the foreground, the player character, armed and ready, faces the mantis in a shallow pool of liquid, emphasizing the tense and confined setting of the boss fight.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nIf the player dies during the fight, they are respawned near Zhu Bajie and can re-enter his stomach to retry. The battle occurs in a restricted area inside Bajie's stomach, where the mantis aggressively attacks both the environment and the player. A nearby checkpoint, the Mantis-Catching Swamp, can be activated for convenience."
