Hidden away in the Forest of Wolves, you won't be able to encounter this boss until you obtain a Key Item later in the game, and this boss is and appropriate challenging fight far stronger than anything else in Black Wind Mountain. Red Loong is one of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n\n* **Rewards:** Boshan Censer, Thunder Tail, Loong Pearl x1, Mind Core x1, Silk x3, 1652 Experience, 1376 Will\n\n\nYou can now find a spot to interact with in front of the large waterfall, using the power of Loong Scales to evaporate the waterfall, and reveal a path to the Red Loong Dragon.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Battle - Red Loong\n\nIf you try to attack from behind, he can even leap up to face you while slashing his tail below him in a retreating strike to stop you from pursuing him.\n\nHe can also use simple claw swipes, which more often than not will create more lightning spots that detonate after a short delay. Always dodge to the opposite side of his swipe so you can retaliate with attacks and not get shocked.\n\nRed Loong can also employ a deadly extended combo, first lunging at you with two claw swipes to create lightning spots, and then leaping into the air to feint around to the other side of you while swinging his tail below — all while finally landing behind you to attack as the lightning detonates on the other side.\n\nWith enough sustained damage, you can eventually stagger and knock down the Red Loong, which is your big moment to maximize your damage output.",
