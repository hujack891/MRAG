Though it is a short area, it will prove to be a challenging one as you go up against the greedy King of the Mountain. Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the cave to the mountaintop, as well as how to defeat the boss of this area in his two forms, the Black Wind King and the Black Bear Guai.\n\n* **Jump to A Section:**\n* **Cave Interior**\n- Black Wind King\n* **Outside the Cave**\n* **Bodhi Peak**\n- Black Bear Guai\n\n\nReturn to the path and take the stairs up to fight against another Wolf Assassin as the cave grows dark, and draw them into the light if needed.\n\nAs you reach an open part of the cave, you’ll have to face one more assassin along the darkened path, and you may notice they’ll go out of their way to destroy the torches along the path to further envelop them in darkness. If you have trouble facing them, always try to bring them to a brighter spot.\n\nNote that if you went ahead and defeated the Secret Boss by ringing the three bells, you should also have access to craft an additional Bronze Set that improves your abilities using the Immobilize Spell!\n\nCraft and upgrade whatever you can afford at the moment, because a boss is waiting inside the temple to test your might, and he’s no pushover.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Black Wind King\n\nBe sure to thoroughly explore this cavern temple after the boss retreats, as there’s plenty of loot to find. Start by checking the far corners to the right when looking back at the entrance you came in through. Look for a group of large pots for one with a golden glow, and break it open to find an **Awaken Wine Worm**. These upgrades can be given to the Shen Monkey back at the Marsh of the White Mist to increase the amount of healing each charge of your Medicine Gourd’s drink will recover!",
