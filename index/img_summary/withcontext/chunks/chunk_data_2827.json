    "img_above_text": "# Temple of Yellow Flowers Walkthrough\n\nWhen you untangle yourself from the webbing, you'll find yourself high above the Webbed Hollow, on a mountain path leading to a large temple filled with Daoist martial artists.\n\n\nAfter grabbing the Treasure Chest they were guarding, head right past a third green Wisp, and through a small ravine guarded by several Daoists to reach a large forested area.\n\n\nFollow the pathway, and you'll find a set of stairs leading up to a large courtyard where a tough Yaoguai Chief is training a large group of Sword Daoists.\n\n\nBe sure to look for a smaller path off to the right as you climb, and you can spot a lone **Treasure Chest** hiding in an alcove.\n\n\nFollow the winding mountain trail up several stairs and avoiding other Worm Practitioners until you reach the very top. The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems.\n\n\nAs you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple. A long slope here will send you down to a large arena, and its here you'll have your second and final encounter with an old foe - the Venom Daoist.\n\n## Boss Fight - Venom Daoist (Second Encounter)\n\nIn his first phase, he'll still use all the same moves you remember, including his most familiar crouching slash that hits twice before he leaps into the air to stab the ground.\n\nJust like before, this is also the best time to attack his extra arms, as you'll be able to deal a ton of damage and even jumpstart the second phase if you destroy them both.",
