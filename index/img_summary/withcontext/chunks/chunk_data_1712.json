    "img_above_text": "# Jade Essence\n\nJade Essence is one of the Drinks you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the others, these provide different healing effects and boosts. The Jade Essence is one of the more basic upgrades, but a good one.\n\nWith the Drink equipped, each sip will recover 36% of your maximum health (a respectable amount) and boost your mana by a moderate amount. That second bonus is the strongest part, as Mana recovery can be vital to survival during some of the more challenging areas. As with all Drinks, the potency of this can be increased by finding the Awoken Wine Worm locations around the game. Our page has every one of them highlighted for you.\n\nYou can then use these special Crafting Materials to upgrade the Drink at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove within Black Wind Mountain. Each upgrade will provide a sizeable buff to your healing potential, but as you level the Drink up, more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed.\n\nThis carries over to New Game Plus too, as you can upgrade your Drinks even more, but even more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed, so you will have to recollect them all in your New Game Plus run.\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Jade Essence Location\n\nThe Jade Essence Drink can be found in the Valley of Ecstasy, Towers of Karma Shrine, in The New West. From the Shrine, along the path to the left, you will eventually find a monument in the back of the area. Sitting behind this monument is the drink on a small snow-covered rock.",
