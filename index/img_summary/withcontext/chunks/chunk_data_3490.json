Below you'll find a guide for the first upper area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find your first encounter with the Venom Daoist, and the different ways to reach The Verdure Bridge.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Upper Hollow**\n* **Pool of Shattered Jade**\n- Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nBefore following the golden trail of a nearby Shrine, look to the left of the bed and small chest to find a path leading to another larger **Treasure Chest** you can open to claim a **Cuo Jin-Yin Belt Hook Curio** , another item that can help resist all the poison you'll be encountering.\n\n\nYou'll now find yourself on the opposite side of the Hollow from where you first started, with a group of platforms in front of you that offer a one-way ticket down to the start of the Middle Hollow and the Verdure Bridge. However, going down there now would cause to a miss a large optional area complete with a boss (but you can drop down early to grab the Shrine and warp back up if you want).\n\n## Pool of Shattered Jade\n\nAs you clear a path through the room, keep an eye on the wall to the right, and you should find a group of hanging cocoons blocking a small alcove. Inside, you'll find a **Treasure Chest** with random materials, but also a Beetle Captain that will burst out of a nearby cocoon!",
