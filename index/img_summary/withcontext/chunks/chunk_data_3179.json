    "img_above_text": "# Venom Daoist\n\nThe Venom Daoist is an enemy character who you will encounter during Chapter 4 of Black Myth Wukong, and will need to defeat twice both in the Webbed Hollow and the Temple of Yellow Flowers. By doing so, you can unlock a secret area to explore.\n\n* Rewards: Gold Tree Core, 2274 Experience, 1927 Will\n\n\nThe Venom Daoist's boss fight is a two-part optional boss encounter that you'll first find exploring the massive Webbed Hollow Portion of Chapter 4. When in the Upper Hollow, look for a ledge to drop down leading to the Pool of Shattered Jade past several hanging cocoons. In a small tunnel past the Shrine, you'll encounter a large cocoon that holds the Venom Daoist.\n\nAfter defeating him a first time, proceed through to the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Once you reach a fork in the road where the left path leads to the Court of Illumination Shrine, look for a path leading right up a mountain trail. Once you reach the top of the stairs, you'll find an alcove to the left leading down a large slope to an arena where the rematch will occur.\n\n\nAfter taking out 2-4 of his extra limbs, he'll likely run out of health, and will beat a hasty retreat. This isn't the last you'll see of him, and in fact he's essential to unlocking a secret area, so we'll look for him again later. At the very least, you'll earn experience and will both for beating him and his cocoon!\n\n## Venom Daoist Boss Fight and Guide - Second Encounter\n\nIn his first phase, he'll still use all the same moves you remember, including his most familiar crouching slash that hits twice before he leaps into the air to stab the ground.\n\nJust like before, this is also the best time to attack his extra arms, as you'll be able to deal a ton of damage and even jumpstart the second phase if you destroy them both.",
