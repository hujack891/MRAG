Its main weapons are a sharp spear and its long neck that it can use to strike you at very high speeds. The Snake Herbalist pulls its neck all the way back before launching this attack, giving you a visual indication of when to dodge.\n\nThe Snake Herbalist has a basket full of poison on its back as well, so keep an eye on your status effects during this fight. Take some Antimiasma Powder when necessary.\n\n## Snake Herbalist Spirit",

This poison pools on the ground and inflicts enemies with Poison Bane if they step into it. Thankfully, these pools don't damage you, so you don't have to worry about watching your step after launching the attack.\n\nThe equipped effect replenishes Health when you take any sort of Medicine, which can be handy in the Webbed Hollow and other places where you are likely to get status afflictions.",
