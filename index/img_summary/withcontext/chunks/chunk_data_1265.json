    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text describes the journey through the Squall Hideout, a cave system filled with enemies and treasures. Players encounter various hazards, such as Pitstones and Blazebones, and interact with a character called the Man-in-Stone, who requests help in reversing his stone form. The path leads to a large crystal-embedded statue, the \"Mother of Stones,\" which is the focus of the upcoming mini-boss fight.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts the \"Mother of Stones\" mini-boss encounter. It shows a glowing, crystal-embedded statue surrounded by bright blue light effects, with the boss's health bar visible at the bottom of the screen. The player appears to be mid-combat, with various UI elements indicating available abilities and resources. The scene emphasizes the visual spectacle of the fight and the stationary nature of the statue.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text explains the mechanics of the \"Mother of Stones\" mini-boss fight. The statue itself does not attack or move, but the challenge comes from surviving waves of hostile Palestones embedded in the environment. The battle is described as an endurance test, requiring players to manage repeated enemy encounters while chipping away at the boss's health."
