    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces the Green-Capped Martialist, a secret boss fight in Chapter 3 of *Black Myth Wukong*. To access this encounter, players must complete a Treasure Hunter's Quest starting at Bitter Lake and progressing to the Valley of Ecstasy, where a hidden Melon Field is located. Rewards for defeating the boss include valuable items, materials, and experience points.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a character standing on a snowy cliff edge, overlooking a steep drop. The environment features rugged terrain, braziers emitting flames, and a dark, forested backdrop. The scene aligns with the description of the Brook of Bliss stream leading to a cliff, suggesting this is the location where players can drop down to access the hidden cave containing the Buddha Statue and potentially the Green-Capped Martialist.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text provides instructions for locating the secret cave. Players are directed to look down from the cliff with braziers to find a drop point leading to a large open cave featuring a Buddha Statue, which is likely tied to the Green-Capped Martialist encounter."
