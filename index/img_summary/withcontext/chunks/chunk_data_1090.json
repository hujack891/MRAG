In the first third of the fight, it will mainly use thunder attacks, so you'll want to have plenty of Shock-Quelling Powder with you and equip any gear or curios that give you extra resistance to shock. Fire will be introduced in the second portion of the fight, so you'll also want Body-Cooling Powder, and the final part will be a combination of the two elements.",

It will lunge and punch at you, so you'll need to learn the timings of its wing attacks.",

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text describes the progression of the \"Foothills Walkthrough\" in the \"Verdant Path\" section. Players are advised to clear out soldiers near the Keeper's Shrine and activate it, with recommendations to visit the Shrine Shop for useful items like powders and gear. The walkthrough then directs players to a clearing adorned with chains, where the Supreme Celestial Inspector appears as a key encounter, particularly if Purple Talismans were collected earlier.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the Supreme Celestial Inspector, a prominent boss character in the \"Verdant Path\" section of the walkthrough. The Inspector is shown wielding a glowing red elemental weapon, likely tied to its thunder and fire attacks mentioned in the context. The setting is a rocky clearing, consistent with the described chains and dead-end location. The Inspector's imposing figure and dynamic pose suggest an intense combat scenario.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text provides combat strategies for the Supreme Inspector fight, emphasizing its use of wing-based melee attacks and elemental abilities. Players are advised to prepare with Shock-Quelling Powder and Body-Cooling Powder for resistance to thunder and fire, respectively. The Plantain Fan is recommended over the Fireproof Mantle for better effectiveness in the second phase of the battle."
