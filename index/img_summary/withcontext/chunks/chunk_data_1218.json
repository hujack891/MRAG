    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text describes the journey leading to a mini-boss encounter in the game *The Forest of Wolves*. Players are guided by the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain, who provides the Incense Trail Talisman for fast travel between Shrines. Shrines serve as checkpoints with expanded options, such as spell customization, skill resets, and shopping. The narrative then transitions to a stream area with collectible materials and a path leading to an optional mini-boss fight against Guangzhi.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the intense combat during the mini-boss fight against Guangzhi. The player character is engaged in battle, wielding a fiery weapon while Guangzhi, the Yaoguai Chief, looms in the background. The interface shows health bars for both the player and Guangzhi, along with quick-access icons for items and abilities. The fiery effects and dynamic motion emphasize the challenging nature of the encounter.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text elaborates on Guangzhi’s ranged attacks, warning players to avoid rushing in recklessly. It describes his ability to somersault backward and throw his twinblade like a boomerang, requiring precise dodging as it spins toward and returns to him. This highlights the need for strategic movement and timing during the fight."
