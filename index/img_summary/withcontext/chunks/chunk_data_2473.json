An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n## Yellow Wind Ridge\n\nCross the small wooden bridge to find another Rat Soldier below the two Rat Archers, and try to lure him away and out of sight if possible. To take on the archers, make use of your Cloud Step to evade their fire and take out the top targets before working your way down, using your staff spin to deflect while waiting for your Cloud Step to recharge. Beware, as they can also toss grenades that can explode in your face with little warning.",

Unlike the instant heal of the Coconut Wine, it will heal a small amount at first, but a larger portion of your health bar over time. However, you’ll also find that it can only be upgraded once, compared to the multiple tiers of health increase that you can invest in the other drink.",
