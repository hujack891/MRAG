He’ll ask you to destroy the Five Carts in Chapter 5, but you’ll only actually need to tackle 4 of them. 3 of these can be found along the main path, but one can be found if you double back on yourself after the rolling spiked ball has gone toward the end of the chapter and enter the Cooling Slope.\n\n\nYou only need to take on 4 of the 5 Elemental Carts in Chapter 5, but there is a fifth one you can find in Furnace Valley. This dead cart has already been dealt with by Ma Tianba the Horse Guai. He can be found in each chapter, but the interaction with him in the fifth chapter is important for unlocking a Transformation Spell. If you want to pick this up for yourself, **interact with the cart BEFORE you fight against Keeper of the Flaming Mountains**. After the Keeper of the Flaming Mountain boss fight, return to the cart and pull the string to get the Dark Thunder Transformation Spell.\n\n\nThere are three bosses in Chapter 5 that will reward you with Samadhi Fire Crystals. These are:\n\n* **Flint Chief** \\- Furnace Valley\n* **Flint Vanguard** \\- Cooling Slope\n* **Mother of Flamlings** \\- Cooling Slope (give 4 Flame Ores to summon her)\n\nGetting the Samadhi Fire Crystals will allow you to craft the Staff of Blazing Karma.\n\n## Baw-Lang-Lang",
