    "img_above_text": "# Field of Fire Walkthrough\n\nField of Fire is the third main area of Chapter 5 in Black Myth: Wukong. Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Ashen Pass III**\n- Boss Fight - Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n* **Cooling Slope**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n- Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\n* **Fallen Furnace Crater**\n- Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n- Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\n\nAfter defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the Yin-Yang Fish, and the Crimson-Silver Cart, you'll have climbed to the top of the Flaming Mountains and be closer to finding out where the Bull King is.\n\n\nThe gauntlet is almost over! As you continue on, there's a small gap on the left you can dart into and then it's onward toward the flames. When you approach, a cutscene will begin where you'll see the golden spiked ball go flying off the end of the cliff.\n\nAfter the cutscene, ignore Pingping running off, and turn back to where you came from. Remember the wall of flames? Head back there. Now that the ball is gone, it's safe to explore the area slowly and you'll find the flames have also disappeared. A path has been revealed, which is the Cooling Slope, and the next place we'll explore.\n\n## Cooling Slope\n\nAs you enter the Cooling Slope for the first time, there are two points of interest to take note of. Up ahead, there's a smattering of rocks. And to the left, there's a Luoija Fragrant Vine.\n\nIf you hug the rocks to the left, you can collect the Luoija Fragrant Vine safely, but be careful as a Searing-Fire will leap out at you as you get close to it.\n\nThen, you'll want to go over to that collection of rocks. When you approach, it will transform into your first miniboss of the region, which is the Flint Vanguard.\n\n\nTop Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top Spirit\n\n\nThis is actually where you can summon a miniboss called the Mother of Flamlings, and to do so, all you need to give over is 4x Flame Ores. Thankfully, Flame Ores are dropped by Flamlings, so you'll hopefully have enough by this point to summon her immediately. Approach the glowing patch and deliver the Flame Ores.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n\nThe Mother of Flamlings, thankfully, won't move. She'll stay where she is and use ranged fireball attacks, very similar to the Flamlings. To combat this, get as close to her as possible and try to land a few attacks. The downside of this, however, is that she will try to whip you with her body. If you can dodge these, she'll smack herself into the ground and be temporarily stunned.",
    "img_below_text": "After hitting her a few times, she'll be frustrated and scream. This is when the Flamlings will emerge and begin to shoot fireballs immediately. You'll want to clear these out as fast as you can and use your Fireproof Mantle and Body-Cooling Powder to counter any fire damage you might experience.\n\nWhen you've cleared out the first round of Flamlings, she'll reappear. This round of attacks will repeat until she's been defeated, except she can reappear when Flamlings are still in the arena after the first round. Still, the priority should be to remove them first before focusing on her.\n\nAfter the Mother of Flamlings fight, pick up the Mother of Flamlings Spirit and then continue on the path down the Cooling Slope.",

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces the Cooling Slope area in *Black Myth: Wukong*, describing initial exploration points and encounters. Players can collect a Luoija Fragrant Vine while avoiding a Searing-Fire enemy.

The glowing red patches on the ground suggest the presence of fire-based hazards, aligning with the narrative's focus on flame-themed enemies and encounters in the Cooling Slope area.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text details the combat strategy for defeating the Mother of Flamlings. Players are advised to dodge her ranged fireball attacks and body whips, capitalize on her temporary stun, and prioritize eliminating Flamlings that emerge during the fight. After victory, players can collect the Mother of Flamlings Spirit and proceed further down the Cooling Slope."
