    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text provides context for the \"Verdant Path\" section of the walkthrough, where players encounter the Supreme Celestial Inspector, a significant boss. It describes the lead-up to the fight, including clearing soldiers near the Keeper's Shrine, visiting the Shrine Shop, and progressing into a clearing where the encounter begins. The Supreme Inspector's initial attack patterns, including melee combos, grabs, ground charges, and shockwave attacks, are detailed.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts an intense boss battle between the Supreme Celestial Inspector and the player character. The Inspector, a winged, humanoid creature with a sword and fiery effects, is mid-air, seemingly in the middle of an attack. The player character, clad in ornate armor and wielding a flaming weapon, faces the Inspector in a rocky, forested arena. The dramatic lighting and dynamic poses emphasize the confrontation's high stakes.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text elaborates on the second phase of the Supreme Inspector fight, where the boss becomes more aggressive and introduces a fiery unicycle as a new attack element. This unicycle enhances the boss's mobility and can be used as an independent weapon to inflict burn damage on the player."
