Players access this area by assisting a drunken Boar character. The fight with Fuban involves phases, and at one point, Fuban burrows into the sand and attacks while swimming beneath it.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a moment during the Fuban boss fight, where the player character is mid-air, seemingly avoiding an upward attack from Fuban, who is burrowing through the sand. The scene highlights the dynamic combat mechanics, with debris and sand erupting around the player, and Fuban's health bar visible at the bottom of the screen.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text explains that Fuban's next move involves swimming directly under the player and attacking upward with its horn. Players are advised to use the Pillar Stance to evade the explosion and minimize damage, losing only stamina instead of health."
