Rat Imperial Guards are extremely fast and fight with dual-handed scythe-like weapons. Perfect Dodging their swipes will help you out greatly in this battle. It is easy to get overwhelmed in this fight, so try to separate them and pick them off one by one.\n\n## Rat Imperial Guard Spirit",

Having the Rat Imperial Guard equipped also increases the amount of Focus you earn while Perfect Dodging. Perfect Dodging is a priceless skill in Black Myth: Wukong, as is Focus, which allows you to deliver stronger blows. Having both work together like that can be extremely helpful in combat.",
