    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text describes the progression through the Verdant Path section of the \"Foothills Walkthrough.\" Players encounter various challenges, including optional bosses and minibosses, culminating in the introduction of the Yaoguai Chief - Feng-Tail General. The text emphasizes stamina management and preparation for the upcoming skill-based boss fight, which involves interacting with the creature's antennae while holding on as it jumps across the water.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a player character standing on the head of a large, insect-like creature with prominent antennae, surrounded by ropes and organic textures. The background showcases a scenic, forested landscape with cliffs and water below, reinforcing the setting described in the walkthrough. This visual likely corresponds to the moment when the player interacts with the Feng-Tail General's antennae during the stamina-based test mentioned in the context.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text elaborates on the mechanics of the Feng-Tail General boss fight. Players must approach the creature's antennae and hold on as it jumps across the water, testing their stamina. Success requires careful skill management, including maxing out Rampant Vigor and locating Celestial Nonary Pills to enhance stamina. The creature eventually stops near the Rhino Watch Slope, marking the completion of this phase of the fight."
