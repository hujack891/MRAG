    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text describes the setup leading to the Cyan Loong boss fight in the Bitter Lake region. The player encounters a frozen dragon humanoid figure holding a fishing rod, which comes to life when interacted with while holding the Loong Scales. This interaction initiates a secret boss fight against the Cyan Loong, who uses various sword-based attacks, including slow two-handed swings and spinning backhand slashes.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the active battle against the Cyan Loong, showcasing a snowy, rocky environment. The player character is engaged in combat with the dragon-like boss, Cyan Loong, whose name and health bar are visible at the bottom of the screen. The boss appears to be mid-attack, with red visual effects indicating damage or an ability activation. The playerâ€™s interface shows health, stamina, and consumable items, emphasizing the intensity of the fight.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text provides strategies for defeating the Cyan Loong. It highlights the boss's susceptibility to stagger, allowing players to interrupt its attacks using light combos, Smash Stance, and bulky Spirit attacks like the Second Rat Prince. These tactics can repeatedly send the Cyan Loong sprawling, limiting its ability to retaliate effectively."
