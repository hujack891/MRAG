Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Ashen Pass III**\n- Boss Fight - Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n* **Cooling Slope**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n- Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\n* **Fallen Furnace Crater**\n- Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n- Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\n\nAfter defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the Yin-Yang Fish, and the Crimson-Silver Cart, you'll have climbed to the top of the Flaming Mountains and be closer to finding out where the Bull King is.\n\n\nThe gauntlet is almost over! As you continue on, there's a small gap on the left you can dart into and then it's onward toward the flames. When you approach, a cutscene will begin where you'll see the golden spiked ball go flying off the end of the cliff.\n\nAfter the cutscene, ignore Pingping running off, and turn back to where you came from. Remember the wall of flames? Head back there. Now that the ball is gone, it's safe to explore the area slowly and you'll find the flames have also disappeared. A path has been revealed, which is the Cooling Slope, and the next place we'll explore.\n\n## Cooling Slope\n\nAs you enter the Cooling Slope for the first time, there are two points of interest to take note of. Up ahead, there's a smattering of rocks. And to the left, there's a Luoija Fragrant Vine.\n\nIf you hug the rocks to the left, you can collect the Luoija Fragrant Vine safely, but be careful as a Searing-Fire will leap out at you as you get close to it.\n\nThen, you'll want to go over to that collection of rocks. When you approach, it will transform into your first miniboss of the region, which is the Flint Vanguard.\n\n\nTop Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top Spirit\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n\nWhen the Flint Vanguard is down, be sure to collect the Flint Vanguard Spirit it drops.
