It is highly recommended that you defeat both The Scorpionlord and Daoist Mi before taking on The Duskveil, as defeating it may cause them to disappear.\n\nTo reach Purple Cloud Mountain, you will have to defeat the Venom Daoist twice - both in the Upper Webbed Hollow, and in a side path outside the Temple of Yellow Flowers main area. This will unlock a mural allowing you to travel to this new area.\n\nOnce you reach the first main shrine at the Valley of Blooms, stick to the left side to find a path up to the Petalfall Village, and continue along either path up to reach the peak, where the main boss lies.\n\n## The Duskveil Boss Fight and Guide\n\nHe'll leap backward after this, sprouting a lot more bony projectiles to throw at you in a concentrated burst. Like before, they can be dodged or even deflected with your staff spin (but they will eat up a lot of stamina).",

If you're already low on stamina from deflecting the first attack, you're better off running to the side to avoid them.\n\nThe good news is that his loud crow leaves enough time for you to interrupt the attack entirely by hitting him with a charged attack or Spirit Attack, cancelling the move entirely.\n\nOnce you know where and when his sword will appear, the rest of the fight will come down to waiting for openings after his big attack to hit him hard, using your Spirit Attacks and Transformation Spells in this phase to speed things up. With all of his attacks being fairly visible to spot coming, it shouldn't take too long to get the hang of and send this demon rooster to the abyss.",
