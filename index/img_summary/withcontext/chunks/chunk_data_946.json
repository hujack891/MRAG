Located in a secret realm locked away in the past, you'll need to activate three bells in order to locate and defeat him.\n\n* **Rewards:** Fireproof Mantle, 2,000 Will\n\n\n* **Bamboo Grove** \\- Traveling through the very short region of the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll have to defeat a character boss, the Whiteclad Noble. Once he retreats, look for a path off to the left instead of heading straight into Black Wind Cave, and you’ll find a large plaza past the marsh where several Wolf Guai sit before a wolf that has been hung from a tree. Just beyond them is the final bell.\n\nNote - Before facing this boss, be sure to defeat the optional **Wandering Wight** that is found in the Forest of Wolves region of Black Wind Mountain if you haven’t faced him already. Not only does he share many attacks with this secret boss, but defeating this one will cause the Wandering Wight to disappear, and you will not be able to gain the Curio and Spirit that the Wight drops.\n\n## Elder Jinchi Fight and Guide\n\nSo long as you deny him opportunities to restore his health, and watch out for when his followers are activated, you only need to keep up the assault and shut down his ground slams or stay far away when they happen. Save your Red Tides transformation spell for right after his healing segment so you don’t waste any time in that form killing walking corpses.",
