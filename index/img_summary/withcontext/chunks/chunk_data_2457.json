Hidden away in the Forest of Wolves, you won't be able to encounter this boss until you obtain a Key Item later in the game, and this boss is and appropriate challenging fight far stronger than anything else in Black Wind Mountain. Red Loong is one of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n\n* **Rewards:** Boshan Censer, Thunder Tail, Loong Pearl x1, Mind Core x1, Silk x3, 1652 Experience, 1376 Will\n\n\nYou can now find a spot to interact with in front of the large waterfall, using the power of Loong Scales to evaporate the waterfall, and reveal a path to the Red Loong Dragon.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Battle - Red Loong\n\nFor your best chance, we recommend swapping to the Pillar Stance, and unleashing a big charge attack when facing his back. With 2-3 Focus Points banked, you have a good chance of slamming your staff down right on his back and hitting one or more pots. Should you connect, you’ll deal a huge amount of damage to Red Loong in a single burst, causing an explosion in the process.",
    "img_below_text": "Be wary though, if you are unable to cause this big damage hit, Red Loong will awaken and trigger his own electric explosion as he rises, and you’ll want to retreat well away before this happens.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s other times when he can detonate a similar explosion even when not getting back from a stun, and it’s hard to tell when this will happen, other than him remaining still and charging the pots on his back for a long moment.\n\nThe rest of this fight will rely on your ability to stagger him back into this state, and maximize the damage to the pots on his back. Make use of Spirits with big hits like the Wandering Wight, and the Azure Dust Transformation spell to score big hits that knock him back, and you’ll have a better chance of stunning him again.",
