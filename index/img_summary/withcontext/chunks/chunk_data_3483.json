Below you'll find a guide for the first upper area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find your first encounter with the Venom Daoist, and the different ways to reach The Verdure Bridge.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Upper Hollow**\n* **Pool of Shattered Jade**\n- Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nBefore following the golden trail of a nearby Shrine, look to the left of the bed and small chest to find a path leading to another larger **Treasure Chest** you can open to claim a **Cuo Jin-Yin Belt Hook Curio** , another item that can help resist all the poison you'll be encountering.\n\n## Upper Hollow\n\nFinally, the cave passage will open up on the left, but there's one more section to check straight ahead. The smaller path leads to a room with a Beetle Captain guarding a Treasure Chest on a higher ledge. The captain will be tougher to beat, so be ready for his quick flitting movements and try to anticipate his charges to deflect with Rock Solid, or pin him in place with Immobilize. Defeating him will allow you to gain the Beetle Captain Spirit, while the **Treasure Chest** on the ledge holds a Gold Tree Core, Mind Core, and other random materials.",
