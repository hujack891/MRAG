    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces the First Prince of Flowing Sands, an optional miniboss in the game Black Myth Wukong, located in a valley cave past Sandgate Village. Defeating this boss is necessary to unlock additional secret bosses. The text provides strategies for defeating the First Prince and hints at a secret trick involving his attacks on a curved wall, which can reveal a hidden area.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a scene from the game where a character stands in front of a wall adorned with numerous small statues. The wall has a noticeable crack, and there is an option to \"Go In,\" suggesting that the wall has been breached, possibly revealing a secret passage or area. This aligns with the context of discovering a hidden area by exploiting the First Prince's attacks.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text explains that if the First Prince's attacks create a crack in the wall with small statues, it can lead to a hidden passage. If the player is unable to trigger this naturally, they can use specific transformations or powerful attacks to break the wall themselves, such as the Wandering Wight’s Spirit headbutt or the Azure Dust transformation spell."
