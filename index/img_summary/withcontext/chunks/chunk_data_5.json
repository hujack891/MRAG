Though the game helps by limiting the skills trees you can first interact with, there is still a wide variety of skills to choose from. With so many choices, choosing which skills to unlock can be daunting, but our guide is designed to help you decide which skills to unlock.\n\n**Jump to:**\n\n* [How to Unlock Skills in Black Myth: Wukong](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#How_to_Unlock_Skills_in_Black_Myth:_Wukong)\n* [How to Understand the Early Game Skills Trees](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#How_to_Understand_the_Early_Game_Skills_Trees)\n* [How to Understand the Mid-to-Late Game Skills Trees](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#How_to_Understand_the_Mid-to-Late_Game_Skills_Trees)\n* [Best Foundation Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Foundation_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Staff Stances Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Staff_Stances_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Mysticism Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Mysticism_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Alteration Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Alteration_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Strand Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Strand_Skills_to_Unlock)\n* [Best Transformations Skills to Unlock](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Best_Skills_to_Unlock#Best_Transformations_Skills_to_Unlock)\n\n\nSkills are divided into two categories: Abilities and Spells. Abilities cover your Foundation skills and Staff Stances, while Spells cover Mysticism, Alterations, Strand, and Transformations.\n\n\nFinally, Mysticism is where you can control the first spell you’ll learn - Immobilize. This will improve the duration of the Immobilize effect, and allow you to cause more damage when attacking using this.\n\n## How to Understand the Mid-to-Late Game Skills Trees\n\nFinally, in the Strand menu, you'll find the spell A Pluck of Many, where you can send out multiple Duplicates to help you. The skills you can unlock here will increase the health of your Duplicates, along with their attack power, and more.\n\n\nAlong with the suggested skills, we'd suggest unlocking skills that will allow you to complete combos without interruption, with more attack power on finishers, and those that build focus quickly.\n\n\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Resolute Counterflow**|  Perform a Heavy Attack during a Light Attack combo to consume Focus Point and perform Resolute Strike.\n**Skyfall Strike**|  After Resolute Strike, perform another Heavy Attack consuming a Focus Point\n**Invigoration**|  Grants massive Focus when performing Resolute Strike\n**Exhilaration**|  Increases the Health recovery when consuming a Focus Point based on talent level\n**Versatility**|  Increases damage of Varied Combos\n\nThe skills you choose in this category will depend on your stance preference but we'd argue that Smash Stance is the best. With the suggested skills, you'll unlock a new Heavy Attack at the end of a Light Attack combo. Adding Invigoration to the chain of Resolute Counterflow and Skyfall Strike will ensure you're building plenty of focus while completing those combos.\n\nThe aim for the Staff Stances category is to get 20 points in there at least to eventually unlock Focus Attack IV and have 4 Focus Points you can build up at a time.\n\n### Best Mysticism Skills to Unlock\n\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Stagnation**|  Extends duration of Immobilization on next attack (Stacks up to 5-10 times)\n**Evanescence**|  When enemies attack after being Immobilized, the duration increases along with the damage they take\n**Raging Flames**|  Focus generates each second you're within the Ring of Fire\n**Consolidation**|  Slowly recover health while in the Ring of Fire.\n\nYou'll unlock Mysticism early on and be able to use Immobilize to stop enemies in their tracks. Skills like Stagnation, where you extend the duration of Immobilization the next time you use the spell are invaluable especially as they stack.\n\nTeam this with Evanescence and you can extend the Immobilization once again, but also increase the damage they take once they try to attack. The goal for this category should be to try and do as much damage as possible and have the spell last as long as you can.",
    "img_below_text": "Later on, you'll also earn Ring of Fire, which will help you recover quicker and can be used to protect against the cold. Skills like Raging Flames and Consolidation are worth unlocking here, to help you recover and build Focus simultaneously so you can jump back into the action as you exit the ring.",
