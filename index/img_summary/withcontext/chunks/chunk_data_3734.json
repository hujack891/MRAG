Clear out the foes, and then open it to find a **Copper Pill** Soak for your Gourd. This one in particular has an impressive effect to negate the cost of Rock Solid when used soon after using the gourd.\n\n\nOpen the large gate the Rat Imperial Guard were posted at, and head through to the other side. Be sure to look to the right as you open the gate, and you’ll find a tree with glowing flowers on it.

This boss has a speciality - and it’s creating blood. Lots of it. This blood can be pretty dangerous too, as he’ll be able to create pools of it all around the arena, and even poison you with it, so make sure you’re stocked on a few antimiasma pills.",
