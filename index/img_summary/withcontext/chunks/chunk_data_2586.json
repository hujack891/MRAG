Here are all the secret bosses you can encounter.\n\n\nWhen you get to the Pagoda Realm, you'll climb the pagoda to reach the top. Opposite the Upper Pagoda Shrine, you can drop down into a pit to find Captain Lotus-Vision. Beating the Captain is essential if you want to unlock those purple seals.\n\n\nBy now, you'll notice that the Loong bosses keep coming. You'll find yourself riding a giant turtle in Chapter 3, and launching into a boss fight. Face toward the water (away from the Keeper's Shrine) and go to the edge. You'll see a statue by the water, which will turn into Cyan Loong if you approach it.\n\n## Yin Tiger",
