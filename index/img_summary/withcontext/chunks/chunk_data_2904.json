However, if you do not defeat him before defeating the actual final boss of this region, he may not be available afterwards.\n\nTo reach Purple Cloud Mountain, you will have to defeat the Venom Daoist twice - both in the Upper Webbed Hollow, and in a side path outside the Temple of Yellow Flowers main area. This will unlock a mural allowing you to travel to this new area.\n\nOnce you reach the first main shrine at the Valley of Blooms, keep to the right to find a pathway leading to the Bounds of Deity's Abode Shrine, and stairs up to where the Scorpionlord lounges drinking on top of a building.\n\nTo goad him into fighting, simply break any of the pots in the area around him.\n\n## The Scorpionlord Boss Fight and Guide\n\nYou may also remember the claw charge used by the Scorpion Princes, as the Scorpionlord will also drag his claw along the ground and drive forward with it. If you react quickly, you can deflect it early to stop his rampage, but later on your Rock Solid won't be enough to stop you from getting knocked back. If you don't stop it early, he'll usually charge past, pivot, and whip his tail to prevent you retaliating.",
