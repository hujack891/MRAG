With a loud gong, the trapped \"Admiral\" will use the cymbal to awaken a giant turtle whose mountainous shell you're actually standing on.\n\nAs the turtle begins to swim through the Bitter Seal, the woman will become aware of your presence, starting this new region off with a bang of a boss fight.\n\n\nAs long as your patient to wait for the right moments to get in close and attack, and make sure you're using shock-quelling medicine, you'll be able to come out on top. Even as Kang-Jin Star tries to flee in her dragon form, the Destined One will see to it that she crashes into the large cymbals, freeing the prisoner inside!\n\nThis imprisoned Pig Guai is none other than Zhu Bajie, who traveled with Sun Wukong during his adventures in Journey to the West!\n\n\nAs you start exploring the path over to the right, an echoing voice will lead you to a large open platform where dragon humanoid figure appears to be frozen in place with its fishing rod.

This new material will unlock the upgrade path for your Loongwreathe Staff into the Golden Loong Staff, but you'll need to find and defeat the last of the four Loongs to craft it.\n\nOnce you've had your fill of exploring the \"Turtle Island\", you can head to the front where the small Pig Guai stands waiting, and interact with him for the turtle to finally make its landing at the next part of the Bitter Lake.\n\n\nStart by heading along the shore and defeating various Frozen Corpses, and look for a small building in the distance by the water's edge. As you near it, you can also spot a dragon man standing alone in the shallows. Zhu Bajie seems to know him, but as you approach, you'll be pulled into another boss fight.\n\n## Boss Fight - Chen Loong\n\nReturn to Chen Loong (who now stands outside the shack by the water), and deliver the pellet to him.

Chen Loong has invited his fellow Zodiac Deities to stay here, which include the Xu Dog and Shen Monkey who you've already met. This means you now have a quick hub area to warp to as needed to trade in your Mind Cores, and upgrade your Gourds.\nIn addition to this, Chen Loong himself will accept any seeds you may have randomly looted when harvesting plants, which will create more materials to freely harvest over time.",

He's a formidable blacksmith who you can interact with to finally upgrade your armor, allowing you to raise the armor ratings of sets you've found previously but became outdated.

However, if you manage to defeat him, expect to unlock a new Transformation Spell and blueprint for a new armor set!",

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text describes the progression of the Bitter Lake Walkthrough, where the player encounters various bosses and unlocks new areas. After defeating Chen Loong and receiving The Ruyi Scroll, the Painted Realm is unsealed, introducing the Zodiac Village as a hub area. This village serves as a central location for trading items, upgrading equipment, and interacting with Zodiac Deities. The narrative sets the stage for meeting the Ying Tiger, a blacksmith capable of upgrading armor and selling crafting materials.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the Ying Tiger, a blacksmith and Zodiac Deity, in the Zodiac Village of the Painted Realm. The interface shows options for crafting weapons, crafting armor, upgrading armor, accessing the store, challenging the Ying Tiger, or leaving. The highlighted \"Upgrade Armor\" option suggests the player is interacting with the Ying Tiger to enhance previously obtained armor. The visual emphasizes the character's role as a skilled craftsman and a key figure for equipment upgrades.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text elaborates on the Ying Tiger's capabilities as a blacksmith, allowing players to upgrade outdated armor sets and purchase crafting materials. Additionally, players can challenge the Ying Tiger to a duel, though he is described as a formidable opponent likely beyond the current level. Defeating him unlocks a new Transformation Spell and a blueprint for crafting a new armor set, further enriching the gameplay progression."
