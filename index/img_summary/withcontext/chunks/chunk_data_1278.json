    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text describes gameplay mechanics and interactions in the \"Fright Cliff Walkthrough,\" specifically focusing on the Man-in-Stone character and his shop. It also introduces the Rockrest Flat area, where players encounter a drunken boar-like Guai who needs help sobering up. Players are given the option to purchase a Sobering Stone from the Man-in-Stone or explore the Yellow Wind Formation for an alternative solution.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a player character approaching a campsite in the Rockrest Flat area. The setting features a dry, open field with sparse vegetation and rocky terrain. A red circular marker highlights an interactable object or point of interest near the campsite, possibly related to the drunken boar-like Guai mentioned in the text. The player interface shows various abilities and resources available for interaction.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text advises players to explore the Rockrest Flat area for collectible items like Fire Bellflower and Fragrant Jade Flowers. It also mentions a Meditation Point near a large curved tree at the cliff's edge, where players can earn a free Skill Point. The text concludes by directing players to return to the Shrine, as the large gate in the field remains inaccessible."
