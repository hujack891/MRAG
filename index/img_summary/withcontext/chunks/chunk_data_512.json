Below you'll find a guide to accessing the kingdom of the past by undertaking the Drunk Boar's Questline to find a Sobering Stone, and how to defeat the Tiger Vanguard and secret Yaoguai King Boss, Fuban.\n\n* Jump to a Section:\n* **How to Access the Kingdom of Sahali**\n- Yaoguai Chief - \"Tiger Vanguard\"\n* **Sandgate Bound**\n- Yaoguai King - Fuban\n\nThis Chapter 2 Secret can only be accessed by meeting the Yellow-Robed Square in Fright Cliff (aka the Drunken Boar), and helping him in his search for the \"Realm of Gold\" which requires a few steps (and for you to best him in combat).\n\n\nOnce you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into the Kingdom of Sahali\n\n\nAs you round the corner, you’ll be told to halt by the defender of a large gate: A slightly familiar looking Tiger Guai who calls himself the Vanguard of the Yellow Wind King. If he looks familiar to another Vanguard you’ve faced, that’s because he’s actually the other Vanguard’s father! He’ll ask that you turn around and head home, which seems like such a waste with all you’ve gone through just to get here.\n\n\nUpon defeat, you’ll gain the **Tiger Tally** curio, and he’ll realize your prowess and invite you to meet his king.\n\n\nThe yellow-furred rat is at an impasse, as the scarab’s magic is preventing him from engaging the monster directly. This is where you come on. The Yellow Rat Sage will agree to pound the drums to force the scarab to the surface, allowing you to engage the behemoth directly and find whatever vessel is giving it its power.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Fuban\n\nFuban can also slowly pull one of its claws back to then sweep upward in front of his face, which can damage you if you aren’t paying attention. If you’re worried about getting hit, you can also play it safe and stick with the Thrust Stance to hit its claws with a long range heavy attack.",

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text provides context for the Yaoguai King Boss Fight against Fuban in the secret Kingdom of Sahali, accessible in Chapter 2 of *Black Myth: Wukong*. Players must complete a questline involving the Drunken Boar to enter the kingdom and defeat the Tiger Vanguard to gain access to Fuban. The text introduces Fuban's combat mechanics, including a claw sweep attack that players must avoid or counter using long-range heavy attacks.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the boss fight against Fuban, showcasing an intense moment during combat in a desert-like environment. Fuban's large claw is visible mid-attack, emphasizing the danger of his sweeping strikes. The player's health bar and ability icons are displayed, along with Fuban's name and health bar at the bottom, indicating an active battle scenario. The blurred motion effect highlights the ferocity and speed of the attack.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text elaborates on Fuban's attack patterns, warning players about additional sweeping strikes with both claws. It advises caution, as consecutive attacks can catch players off guard if they assume the danger has passed after the first swipe. This reinforces the need for strategic positioning and awareness during the fight."
