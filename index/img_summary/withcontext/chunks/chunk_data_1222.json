    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text describes the journey through \"The Forest of Wolves,\" where players follow trails of gold to Shrines that serve as checkpoints. These Shrines allow players to rest, refill resources, and access new gameplay options such as spells, skill resets, and a store. The narrative transitions to \"Outside the Forest,\" introducing an optional mini-boss fight against the Yaoguai Chief, Guangzhi. Players are advised to use the Immobilize spell strategically during the fight to disrupt Guangzhi's attacks and defeat him.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the aftermath of the mini-boss fight against Guangzhi. The player character is shown wielding Guangzhi's fiery blade, which glows with intense energy, signifying its importance as a reward. The surrounding environment features lush greenery, rocky terrain, and mystical elements, emphasizing the game's atmospheric design. The blade's presence suggests the acquisition of a new ability or transformation spell tied to the defeated mini-boss.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text elaborates on the reward from defeating Guangzhi: the fiery blade grants the Transformation Spell \"Red Tides,\" enabling players to transform into Guangzhi and use his abilities in combat. This spell provides a secondary health and might bar, with powerful attacks that decay over time. Players can utilize Guangzhi's spinning light attacks, quick dashes, and a special pogo jump attack for enhanced gameplay versatility."
