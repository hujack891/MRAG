As an optional foe, you can seek out this boss as part of the Man-in-Stone's Quest, and gain the ability to turn into a Rock Guai yourself by defeating her.\n\n* Rewards: Essence of Stone\n\n## Where to Find the Mother of Stones\n\nYou can encounter the Mother of Stones boss while exploring the Fright Cliff area, which becomes available after defeating the King of Flowing Sands and his Second Rat Prince, and then heading right to cross a rope bridge.\n\nOnce inside the Fright Cliff region, head past the Squall Hideout Shrine and keep left to enter a large cave area, and take a left turn to find the unresponsive boss.\n\n### Mother of Stones Boss Fight\n\nAfter taking enough damage, the Mother of Stones will let out a roar, signaling a Palestone will quickly appear to defend her. That’s your cue to immediately break off your attack, regain your stamina, and be ready to dodge the incoming stone monster. Survival will hinge on how well you can deal with each wave while taking minimal damage, and understanding their melee and ranged attacks.",
    "img_below_text": "Once you’ve defeated two waves of single Palestones each, the third wave will consist of two Palestones at the same time. This can be a huge problem fast if they gang up on you with alternating attacks. Deflecting their ranged quartz missiles isn’t too bad… until you’re also dealing with one trying to body slam you.\n\nThis is the time to use everything in your arsenal to stay alive. Make sure you’re using your Spirit attacks to focus fire a target, unleash any stored Focus Points, and use Immobilize or Cloud Step to stay out of danger.",
