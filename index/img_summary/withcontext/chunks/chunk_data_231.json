    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe player has entered the \"Precept Corridor\" area, where they encounter a mysterious chubby monk who hints at the presence of an invisible Buddha statue on the cliffs. The monk cryptically suggests worshiping with \"true hearts\" to reveal the path forward, implying the need to interact with specific Buddha statues.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a snowy, mountainous area with a large crowned Buddha statue situated between two columns. The player character, wielding a staff, is approaching the statue, which appears to be a key interactive element in the game. The environment suggests a serene yet mystical setting, with the statue likely serving as part of a puzzle or progression mechanic.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe player is instructed to head left from the pavilion to find and interact with one of the large Buddha statues. This interaction is part of a sequence involving multiple statues to progress further in the \"Precept Corridor\" area."
