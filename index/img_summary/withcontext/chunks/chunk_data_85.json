Before making that turn, be sure to look to the right to find a small wooden gazebo with a small table, and open the small gold box on top to find a variety of medicines, including 2 **Tiger Subduing Pellets** , 1 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 1 **Amplification Pellet**.\n\n\nAnother good strategy to note is that if you’re in danger of getting close to becoming poisoned, using the Red Tides spell can help you transform out of danger. Any status effects suffered while transformed as Guangzhi will be removed when you regain your regular health bar. As an added bonus, Guangmou will even comment on your transformation.\n\nOnce you’ve learned how to evade his projectiles, the rest of the fight will just boil down to chasing him down and stunning him however you can with Immobilize, your Spirit Attack, and other heavy hits. When he falls, you’ll gain Guangmou’s Spirit to add to your collection, allowing you to summon venomous snakes of your own!\n\n\nWhen you’re ready to move on, make sure you’re fully healed up from dealing with that snake, as the end of this downward path leads to the titular marsh where a very strong boss waits to block your path.\n\n## Boss Fight - Whiteclad Noble\n\nDefeat him to earn a **Jade Fang** , and he’ll concede, revealing he was only feigning loyalty to the king of this mountain to learn more. He’ll also drop a helpful nugget of wisdom as he departs, mentioning though the temple lies in cinders, the Elder’s soul endures, and asks if you’ve seen the three bells.\n\nThis will finally prompt the Keeper to tell the tale of the three bells — two of which you’ve found guarded by Guangmou and Guangzhi. The third happens to lie not far from this site. Instead of moving forward, look to the left to spot a flooded ravine to travel through.",
