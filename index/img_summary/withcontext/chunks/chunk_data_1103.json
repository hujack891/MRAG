    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text describes the progression of the walkthrough in the \"Verdant Path\" section. Players are guided to defeat the Supreme Celestial Inspector, who introduces a red haze mechanic that can be countered using the Plantain Fan. After defeating the Inspector, players gain access to Wukong's Somersault Cloud ability, which is used to explore further. The text then directs players to a pool of water below a cliff, where they encounter the first optional boss, Jiao-Loong of Waves.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the optional boss, Jiao-Loong of Waves, a large, serpentine humanoid creature with aquatic features, standing in a pool of water. The boss is imposing, with sharp scales, a long tail, and a necklace-like adornment. A player character, clad in armor and wielding a staff, is engaged in combat with the creature, emphasizing the boss's size and menacing presence. The surrounding environment is a serene yet ominous water-filled area, enclosed by rocky cliffs.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text elaborates on the encounter with Jiao-Loong of Waves. It highlights the boss's limited moveset, primarily involving tail-based attacks such as whipping through spinning or flipping motions. Players are encouraged to observe and adapt to these attack patterns to defeat the boss effectively."
