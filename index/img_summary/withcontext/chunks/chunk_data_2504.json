An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n## Village Entrance\n\nThe Xu Dog as he’s known has a problem he needs help with: A large frog has swallowed one of his medicinal formulas, and you’re just the person he’s looking for to get it back.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw\n\nHeading back down the hill towards the path at the bottom, be sure to stop by a lone shack far apart from the others. You’ll hear some whispering as you draw close, and a voice will speak out as you interact with the shack, telling you to go away for fear the two-headed Rat Captains will find them. Keep talking with the mysterious voice, and after you’ve rid the area of captains, they’ll thank you, and mention they may go off in search of the missing Third Prince somewhere in the West.",

Defeat them to gain access to a large open field inside the Village’s main area. From across the field, a voice pleading to be freed calls out, but in your way is a large loping creature that will want to engage you first.",
