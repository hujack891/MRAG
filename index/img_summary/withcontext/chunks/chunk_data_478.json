Below you'll find a guide to accessing the temple with all three bell locations, and how to defeat the secret Yaoguai King boss, Elder Jinchi.\n\nThis Chapter 1 Secret can only be accessed by ringing three large bells found around Black Wind Mountain, and will transport you to a different location to fight the secret boss that possess a magical item that is instrumental in defeating the Black Wind King.\n\n\n* **Bamboo Grove** \\- Traveling through the very short region of the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll have to defeat a character boss, the Whiteclad Noble. Once he retreats, look for a path off to the left instead of heading straight into Black Wind Cave, and you’ll find a large plaza past the marsh where several Wolf Guai sit before a wolf that has been hung from a tree. Just beyond them is the final bell.\n\n\nActivate the shrine in the entrance plaza, and then be sure to look around this area before proceeding inside. Opposite the Shrine, look around the other withered tree for three nearby chests that hold lots of Will, 2 **Yarn** , 3 **Stone Spirit** , and **Guanyin’s Prayer Beads** arm gear.\n\nYou will also find that unlike the rest of Chapter 1, the Keeper's Shrine here sells a unique selection in the shop only purchasable at this Secret Area, and it's worth stocking up on the items since they're pretty rare for this point in the game:\n\n| Ancient Guanyin Temple Shrine Shop | Ancient Guanyin Temple Shrine Shop |\n| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| Evil Repelling Medicament (x2)     | Longevity Decoction (x2)           |\n| Silk (x2)                          | Yaoguai Core (x2)                  |\n\nNote - Before facing this boss, be sure to defeat the optional **Wandering Wight** that is found in the Forest of Wolves region of Black Wind Mountain if you haven’t faced him already. Not only does he share many attacks with this secret boss, but defeating this one will cause the Wandering Wight to disappear, and you will not be able to gain the Curio and Spirit that the Wight drops.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Battle - Elder Jinchi\n\nThe only thing you can do is beat Jinchi to the punch. Start sprinting around the arena the moment you spot a body, and use a single attack to defeat them and steal their health instead. You’ll have to race back and forth, so conserve your stamina by only using quick attacks before getting back to sprinting.\n\nOnce enough have been absorbed by either you or him, he’ll return to the ground and the fight will resume.",
    "img_below_text": "So long as you deny him opportunities to restore his health, and watch out for when his followers are activated, you only need to keep up the assault and shut down his ground slams or stay far away when they happen. Save your Red Tides transformation spell for right after his healing segment so you don’t waste any time in that form killing walking corpses.",
