    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text introduces the Cloudtreading Deer, a Yaoguai Chief encountered in Chapter 6 of *Black Myth: Wukong*. The boss fight consists of two phases, with the first phase featuring frost-based attacks and tornadoes as key challenges. Players are advised to use Body-Warming Powder to counter frost effects and prepare for the deer’s ramped-up attacks signaled by the appearance of tornadoes.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts the Cloudtreading Deer mid-air amidst several towering frost tornadoes in a rocky, snow-covered clearing. The visual highlights the deer’s frost-based elemental attacks and the tornado mechanic described in the guide, emphasizing the challenging nature of the first phase of the boss fight.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text provides strategies to mitigate the tornado mechanic during the fight, recommending the Wind Tamer vessel to eliminate the tornadoes temporarily. It also notes that while this tool is helpful, players must still contend with the deer’s aerial and frost-based attacks during its cooldown period."
