You'll need to summon her with Fire Ore to make her appear, then you're in for a fight against her and her Flamlings.\n\n## How to Find Mother of Flamlings\n\nThis is actually where you can summon a miniboss called the Mother of Flamlings, and to do so, all you need to give over is 4x Flame Ores. Thankfully, Flame Ores are dropped by Flamlings, so you'll hopefully have enough by this point to summon her immediately. Approach the glowing patch and deliver the Flame Ores.\n\n### Mother of Flamlings Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe Mother of Flamlings, thankfully, won't move. She'll stay where she is and use ranged fireball attacks, very similar to the Flamlings. To combat this, get as close to her as possible and try to land a few attacks. The downside of this, however, is that she will try to whip you with her body. If you can dodge these, she'll smack herself into the ground and be temporarily stunned.",
    "img_below_text": "After hitting her a few times, she'll be frustrated and scream. This is when the Flamlings will emerge and begin to shoot fireballs immediately. You'll want to clear these out as fast as you can and use your Fireproof Mantle and Body-Cooling Powder to counter any fire damage you might experience.\n\nWhen you've cleared out the first round of Flamlings, she'll reappear. This round of attacks will repeat until she's been defeated, except she can reappear when Flamlings are still in the arena after the first round. Still, the priority should be to remove them first before focusing on her.\n\nAfter the Mother of Flamlings fight, pick up the Mother of Flamlings Spirit and then continue on the path down the Cooling Slope.",
