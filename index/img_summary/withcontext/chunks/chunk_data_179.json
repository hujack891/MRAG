    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text describes the conclusion of events on \"Turtle Island,\" where the protagonist and Zhu Bajie, a character from *Journey to the West*, prepare to move forward. After defeating bosses and collecting valuable items, the turtle transports them to the North Shore of the Bitter Lake, marking the transition to a new area with opportunities for exploration and progression.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts Zhu Bajie and the protagonist standing on a snowy terrain, likely the North Shore of the Bitter Lake. Zhu Bajie is partially submerged in the snow, holding his weapon, while the protagonist stands nearby with a staff. In the distance, a rocky landscape and a tree-like structure are visible, suggesting the start of exploration in this new region.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text introduces the North Shore of the Bitter Lake as a branching area with multiple paths to explore. Players can visit the North Shore Shrine or pursue optional areas with bosses. Alternatively, they can proceed toward the Precept Corridor via a frozen tunnel. The text emphasizes the importance of exploring the left side first to avoid missing key content."
