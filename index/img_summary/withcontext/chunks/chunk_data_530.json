However, you'll only be able to access it in Chapter 5 after completing all the secret areas in the game. We'd recommend waiting until you've finished Chapter 6 of the game and beat it before you visit Mount Mei, due to it being a vital place to see for the secret ending of the game.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **How to Unlock Mount Mei**\n* **How to Enter Mount Mei from The Great Pagoda**\n* **Mount Mei**\n- Erlang, The Sacred Divinity\n- The Four Heavenly Kings\n- Erlang Shen\n\n\nThere are several steps you need to take to unlock Mount Mei. You can find a detailed breakdown on our dedicated page: How to Unlock the Secret Ending (True Ending). But here's a quick rundown of everything you'll need to do by Chapter 6 to reach it.\n\n1. Complete the Chapter 1 secret area of the Ancient Guanyin Temple\n2. Complete the Chapter 2 secret area of the Kingdom of Sahali\n3. Complete the Green-Capped Martialist/Treasure Hunter quest in Chapter 3\n4. Complete the Chapter 4 secret area of the Purple Cloud Mountain\n5. Complete the Chapter 5 secret area of Bishui Cave\n6. Return to **The Great Pagoda in Chapter 3**. You can find it on the Snow-Veiled Trail in the Pagoda Realm.\n\n\nWhen you’re in The Great Pagoda, you’ll see tapestries around the room. One tapestry, at the very top of the room, will be red. Head for this, and a cutscene will begin where the small Buddha from Chapter 3 will be waiting for you. He'll open the tapestry and let you into Mount Mei.\n\n\nWhen you're through the tapestry, head up the stairs and follow the path. About halfway up you'll need to shimmy across a ledge on the left to reach the other side, then you'll continue up to the Mei-Jian Peak Keeper's Shrine.\n\n## Mei-Jian Peak\n\nHere is where you'll need to get your gear together before you go up to the tip of the mountain, where you'll be entering a boss battle against a familiar face.\n\n### Erlang, The Sacred Divinity\n\nWhen the second stage begins, he'll fly up in the air and a giant axe will appear. This will swing and eventually crash down but can be dodged quite easily. The attack doesn't end here, however, as Erlang quickly follows up with his own attack to try and catch you off guard. This will send out a ripple that looks like ice, that you'll need to roll over or jump to avoid.",
    "img_below_text": "From this phase onward, you will have to deal with lighting from Erlang, so Shock-Quelling Powder and resistance to shock attacks are a huge help here.\n\nThe second stage is a series of combo attacks, where he'll use his staff and swap between a small version of the axe or a sword. When he has the sword, you can expect projectiles to follow. These can be blocked by spinning your sword or dodging.\n\nThe problem with this stage is getting the timings right, as his attacks can often seem delayed from when they feel like they should end. If you're using Spells, do not try to use Immobilize until his shield is down again. You'll want to keep hitting him and use Cloudstep to build up your Focus, then whittle his shield down or use the Plantain Fan to do it, if you can get it back quickly. All other Spells aren't worth wasting your Mana on.",

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text provides context for a boss battle in the \"Mei-Jian Peak\" section of the Chapter 3 secret area walkthrough for *Black Myth: Wukong*. It introduces Erlang, The Sacred Divinity, as the boss encountered at the peak. The text describes the first stage of the fight, where Erlang uses a giant axe and follows up with ice ripple attacks, requiring players to dodge or roll to avoid damage.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a dramatic boss battle in a snowy mountain setting. A character wielding a glowing, fiery staff faces off against an airborne opponent brandishing a weapon. The environment features icy cliffs, barren trees, and a desolate, wintry landscape, emphasizing the intensity and isolation of the encounter.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text elaborates on the second stage of the battle with Erlang. It highlights his use of lightning attacks, combo moves with a staff, and weapon transformations. Players are advised to use Shock-Quelling Powder and focus on breaking Erlang's shield while timing their actions carefully to counter his delayed attack patterns. Specific strategies, such as using Cloudstep and the Plantain Fan, are recommended for success."
