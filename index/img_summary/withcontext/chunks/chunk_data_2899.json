    "img_above_text": "# The Great Sage's Broken Shell\n\nThe Great Sage's Broken Shell is one of the main and final bosses you'll fight in Chapter 6 of Black Myth: Wukong. You'll jump into this fight as soon as you finish against The Stone Monkey, and it's the final one needed to see the ending of the game.\n\n\nYou'll start this fight as soon as you finish the one against The Stone Monkey.\n\n## The Great Sage's Broken Shell Boss Fight and Guide\n\nWe'd recommend having Ring of Fire equipped, so you can match him, and upgrade it as much as possible. Strangely enough, if you step into his Ring of Fire, you can also use it to build your Focus.\n\nHowever, you may prefer to use Spell Binder (if you've unlocked it) and increase your Attack and Critical Hit Chance. We'd also suggest using Plantain Fan again in this phase. You should also use Medicines like the Loong Aura Amplification Pellets, Ginseng Pellets, and Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets to buff your Focus gain and attack.\n\n\nAs mentioned, the Great Sage will use multiple stances, and you'll occasionally see him climb his staff to perform Pillar Stance. This is not to evade your attacks but is just a way to slam down on you from above. As you see the staff start to bend toward you, get ready to dash away.\n\nFinally, be mindful of where you stand in this fight. If you're too far from him, he'll throw out his staff as a spinning projectile, or swap to Thrust Stance to attack you. It's best to stick close to him but jump back when he performs perfect dodges or throws out Pluck of Many.\n\nJust like the Stone Monkey, once you've got his health bar down all the way, phase two will begin.\n\n### The Great Sage's Broken Shell Phase Two\n\nLastly, you'll see him use the Somersault Cloud spell to zoom around the area, hit you, and dash off. He will try to grab you when using this, so it's important to learn the timings and roll away as often as possible.\n\nJust like the first phase, the key to this fight is attacking when you have your Focus Points built up and not trying to finish light combos. He'll typically interrupt them or use his perfect dodge to hurt you in the process, so it's best to wait until you can land those heavy attacks. It's also important to note him during his Rock Solid phase! Otherwise, you'll see the Destined One kicked around by the Great Sage's duplicates.",
    "img_below_text": "Using Gingseng Pellets and Ring of Fire will get your Focus up in no time, and Smash Stance is generally favorable here, to land those heavy slamming attacks. Don't forget to throw out the Plantain Fan as soon as it's ready each time, as well, as this is one of the best ways to attack him undisturbed.\n\nOnce the fight is over, The Great Sage's Broken Shell will be vanquished, and a cutscene will begin. The Great Sage will stumble in the water and the relics will leave his body as golden orbs.\n\nEach one will land inside the Destined One as the Great Sage crumbles, and his crown lands in the water. As the Old Monkey appears again, he'll place the crown upon the Destined One's head and finish the tale of Sun Wukong.",
