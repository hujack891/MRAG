    "img_above_text": "# Macaque Chief\n\nThe Macaque Chief is a required and recurring Yaoguai Chief miniboss fight that you can encounter multiple times in Chapter 3 of Black Myth Wukong. Located in both the Snowhill Path, Pagoda Realm and Thunderclap Temple, this tricky opponent is hard to pin down.\n\n* **Rewards:** Will, Ring of Fire Spell (Second Encounter), Refined Iron Sand, Random Materials, 1847 Experience (Final Encounter)\n\n## Where to Find the Macaque Chief\n\nAs a required boss fight, you'll encounter the Macaque Chief in multiple points when exploring The New West and progressing to reach the Sage's Will held by Goldenbrow.\n\nThe first time you'll encounter this enemy is early in the Snowhill Path as you reach a plateau along the Snowclad Path after you spot the monkey awakening the Frozen Corpses.\n\nOnce defeated, the Macaque Chief will flee, only to appear later on in the Pagoda Realm after you have escaped the prison. You'll find him just inside the Warding Temple, harassing the Wise Master until you intervene.\n\nAfter a second defeat, you'll face him one last time near the end of the chapter, in-between two bouts that you'll have with the end boss, Yellowbrow.\n\n* First Encounter\n* Second Encounter\n* Final Encounter\n\n\nFinally, if you spend to much time dishing out damage to his face, he'll eventually counter with an unexpected move: puking on you. This will deal an immense amount of poison buildup, so be ready to Immobilize or dodge around behind him.\n\nWith his small frame, the Macaque Chief is fairly susceptible to being staggered with charged up heavy strikes. Build up your focus from light attack combos when dodging him, and then knock him down with big hits or after deflecting his moves.\n\n\nWhen you fight him a second time, he'll largely have the same moves, but as an added bonus for this fight, you can actually use the Ancient Master's circle of fire to your own advantage, as the Macaque Chief can't move through it. If you ever see him preparing for a big series of slashes or need to get away and heal simply move to the opposite side of the circle, and his attacks won't reach you.\n\n### Final Encounter - Mahavira Hall\n\nThe clones don't have a whole lot of health (but they can replicate most of his moves - including poison spewing!), so go all in and blitz them quickly with a combination of Spirits attacks and Transformation Spells like Ashen Slumber, getting in enough hits to detonate yourself and deal massive damage to everyone if possible.\n\nThe sooner you remove the clones from the fight, the sooner you'll be able to tag team the Macaque Chief again -- but be prepared for him to pull the similar trick later on if the fight is drawn out long enough.",
