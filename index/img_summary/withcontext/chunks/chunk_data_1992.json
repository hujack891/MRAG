However during Chapter 2 in Yellow Wind Ridge you will be able to start using them, providing you complete a questline.\n\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Mind Core Locations\n\nBelow, you can find a list of all the Mind Core locations in the game's first two chapters:\n\n\nWhen you stumble upon a blue, glowing enemy and defeat them, you have a chance to get a Mind Core. They aren't as common as Blood of the Iron Bull's but these enemies do possess them occasionally. These enemies will also drop their Spirit for you to claim, so be sure to seek them out in our Spirit Locations guide.\n\n\n\n\nThe next Mind Core is an automatic reward, granted upon completing Chapter 1 - Black Wind Mountain. Once you defeat Black Bear Guai and exit the chapter mural, you will get it.\n\n\n\n### Mind Core Location 7\n\nThe next Mind Core is found at the Rockrest Flat Shrine in Fright Cliff in Yellow Wind Ridge. Directly to your right, there will be a set of stairs you can go up and a sand waterfall at the top. Head through and defeat Black Loong to get it.\n\nYou will need to obtain the Loong Scales from Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge before you are able to access the secret area behind the sand waterfall. This will require you to defeat the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince and First Prince of Flowing Sands. The video guide below will take you through how to obtain the Loong Scales.",
