Though it is a short area, it will prove to be a challenging one as you go up against the greedy King of the Mountain.

With the shrine so close, go wild with your abilities and spells to quickly mow them down, then rest up.\n\nNow that you’ve defeated the Whiteclad Noble, new upgrades will be available for your gear in the Shrine’s menu — including three pieces of the Serpentscale Set, and the Twin Snake Staff that you can upgrade from your existing staff by using the Jade Fang the noble dropped.",
