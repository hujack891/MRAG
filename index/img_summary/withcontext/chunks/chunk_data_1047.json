Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Ashen Pass III**\n- Boss Fight - Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n* **Cooling Slope**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n- Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\n* **Fallen Furnace Crater**\n- Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n- Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\n\nAfter defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the Yin-Yang Fish, and the Crimson-Silver Cart, you'll have climbed to the top of the Flaming Mountains and be closer to finding out where the Bull King is.\n\n\nThe gauntlet is almost over! As you continue on, there's a small gap on the left you can dart into and then it's onward toward the flames. When you approach, a cutscene will begin where you'll see the golden spiked ball go flying off the end of the cliff.\n\nAfter the cutscene, ignore Pingping running off, and turn back to where you came from. Remember the wall of flames? Head back there. Now that the ball is gone, it's safe to explore the area slowly and you'll find the flames have also disappeared. A path has been revealed, which is the Cooling Slope, and the next place we'll explore.\n\n\nCollect the green Wisps from the far edge on the left, then follow the path where the fox went toward the Bull King. This will take you down a path that leads up to the Bull King, and where you can find the next Keeper's Shrine called Fallen Furnace Crater.\n\n## Fallen Furnace Crater\n\nHead up the slope to see Pingping speak to her father. The Bull King isn't best pleased with The Destined One, but also has an issue with Pingping and her deception. It turns out that Pingping is actually the Red Boy, and he will transform before your eyes, ready for a battle.\n\n\nWhen he's back down on the floor after sending out the duplicates, his attacks will be way more aggressive and he'll be more agile. You'll find that he repeats the same variations of attack, they'll just have a wider reach. For example, he'll spin his spear for longer, resulting in fire emerging around him, and then will leave areas of the ground covered in flames.\n\nYou can approach the second part of the fight in much the same way you did the first, and if you haven't used too many spells, now is the time to unleash them and get the rest of his health down as soon as possible.\n\nAfter being the Red Boy, the Bull King will reveal the stone that was kept in his belly. At the end of the conversation, the Red Boy's body will begin to disappear. But before The Destined One can collect the stone, the Red Boy emerges, showing that he used a False Death Talisman and is actually alive. He consumes the stone and immediately transforms into the Yaksha King.\n\n### Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\n\nAfter knocking down a chunk of his health, there will be times when he starts to switch to using just one blade. You'll know when this is about to happen, as only one blade will glow brightly, while the other will be dimmed. When he does this, this will mean that the blade will be able to reach much further, and he'll create huge extended arcs with it. He often does this in chains of three and will start to say a word like \"Merciless\" or \"Sheathless\" before each attack. You'll want to learn the timings of this attack, so you can dodge and roll right underneath it each time.",
    "img_below_text": "In the second part of the fight, he'll become much more aggressive. This will also be when Zhu Bajie leaves the fight. He won't only swing the blade around himself like he did in the first portion of the fight, but he'll also swing the sword overhead and land it down in front of him. When he does this, he'll send out a trail of the grass-like blades. You can dodge the long arcs in the same way you did for the first part of the fight, and dodge side to side to avoid the trail of blades.",
