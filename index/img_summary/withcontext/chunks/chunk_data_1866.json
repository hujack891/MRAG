    "img_above_text": "# Macaque Chief\n\nThe Macaque Chief is a required and recurring Yaoguai Chief miniboss fight that you can encounter multiple times in Chapter 3 of Black Myth Wukong. Located in both the Snowhill Path, Pagoda Realm and Thunderclap Temple, this tricky opponent is hard to pin down.\n\n* **Rewards:** Will, Ring of Fire Spell (Second Encounter), Refined Iron Sand, Random Materials, 1847 Experience (Final Encounter)\n\n## Where to Find the Macaque Chief\n\nAs a required boss fight, you'll encounter the Macaque Chief in multiple points when exploring The New West and progressing to reach the Sage's Will held by Goldenbrow.\n\nThe first time you'll encounter this enemy is early in the Snowhill Path as you reach a plateau along the Snowclad Path after you spot the monkey awakening the Frozen Corpses.\n\nOnce defeated, the Macaque Chief will flee, only to appear later on in the Pagoda Realm after you have escaped the prison. You'll find him just inside the Warding Temple, harassing the Wise Master until you intervene.\n\nAfter a second defeat, you'll face him one last time near the end of the chapter, in-between two bouts that you'll have with the end boss, Yellowbrow.\n\n* First Encounter\n* Second Encounter\n* Final Encounter\n\n### Macaque Chief Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nHe'll step back to grab the sword with his foot and jump onto its hilt, before preforming a quick roll along the ground to drag the sword in a whirlwind slice with a large reach to it, followed by a final downward slam, so don't press your attack too hard during this combo, or Immobilize him before the second part of his combo.",
    "img_below_text": "A longer deadly combo attack he can employ comes with three quick slashes ending in a jumping upward slash. After a brief pause in the air, he'll use his foot to send the blade slamming down vertically, and then yank it back up in an arc for a final two-hand diagonal slice attack. Your Rock Solid won't always stagger him mid-combo, so it's better to wait and parry the final slice so you can retaliate faster.",
