Below, you'll find a Walkthrough for the first major area of The Flaming Mountains called Woods of Ember, as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* ** **Ashen Pass I\n- Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Brown-Iron Cart\n* **Camp of Seasons**\n* **Height of Ember**\n- Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones\n- Yoaguai Chief - Gray-Bronze Cart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind\n* **Ashen Pass II**\n\n\nInstead of finding him wherever you left him kneeling, you'll now see him by the edge of the cliff. As you come back down the stairs to the area where you fought him, you'll see a small set opposite with two Buddha statues on either side. Go up these and to the left, to find him overlooking the mountain. Talk to him and exhaust any new dialogue.\n\n## Camp of Seasons\n\nTurn right on the other side of the bridge, and start to head through the cave. On the right side of the cave is a green Wisp, but you'll first want to deal with the Revenant Charbone that will run at you as you step into the darkness. These things will cause fire damage and when you've knocked their health bar down, they'll explore. Take it out immediately and then pick up the Wisp, avoiding the explosion.\n\n### Tip!\n\nExit the little cave and continue on, where you'll see two more Revenant Charbones with a larger figure (a Revenant Charface) straight ahead. Clear these out first, and be careful of the fast slashing attacks from the Revenant Charface, which also continues once you've killed it.\n\nWhen it's safe, turn back on yourself. The Fire Bellflower that was on the left as you exited the small cave will now be on the right, and you'll see a path on the right that leads to the next section.",
