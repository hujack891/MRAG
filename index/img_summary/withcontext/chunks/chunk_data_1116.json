Make your way into the center of the clearing, where Bajie will exclaim it's a dead end. However, you'll soon be joined by the Supreme Celestial Inspector. If you found all of the Purple Talismans in Chapter 4, then this will be a familiar face to you.\n\n\nWhen his health is down to the last third, he will cover the arena with a red haze, reducing the size of the arena that you'll fight the creature in. He will also begin to use two swords instead of one. This is when you want to throw out the Plantain Fan. It will clear the red haze immediately and continuously stun him, giving you more time to whittle down his health.\n\nAfter defeating the Supreme Inspector, he'll pick you up and fly off with you.

Go down and to the center of this water to fight our first optional boss, Jiao-Loong of Waves.\n\n\nOn the opposite side of the water, there's a clearing, with what appears to be a big rock sitting by the edge of it. This is actually one of the Poison Chiefs in the area, so fly over to it to tackle your next miniboss.\n\n\nWhen the Poison Chief is down, fly up and continue left toward the water. Go almost to the end of the water, where you should see a giant creature. When you get close to it, it will leap in the air and jump to a nearby rock. Fly over to it, then land on its head.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Feng-Tail General\n\nFirstly, it will test your stamina. When you approach it near the Mantis-Catching Swamp, and land on its head you'll need to approach its antennae. Interact with them and hold on. It will begin to jump around the water, eventually ending up near the Rhino Watch Slope. Your stamina bar will drain as it does this, and you'll only be able to complete the test if it doesn't completely run out before the critter stops jumping. If you're finding it hard to hold on, reset some skills and ensure that Rampant Vigor is maxed out under Survival, and see if you've missed any Celestial Nonary Pill Locations.",

Before you do this, equip your Fireproof Mantle, and ensure you've maxed out your Bane Mitigation skill. Check to see if you have any other gear you can equip that helps with burn resistance, and see if you've missed any Celestial Jade Lotus Pill Locations.\n\nIf you're able to hang on without dying, you'll snap the antennae from the insect and receive the Golden Feng-Tail Crown.",
