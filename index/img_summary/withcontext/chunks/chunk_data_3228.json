    "img_above_text": "# Violet Spider\n\nThe Violet Spider is a main Yaoguai \"Queen\" boss fight that you can encounter in Chapter 4 of Black Myth Wukong. The leader of the Spider Guai and master of The Webbed Hollow, the Violet Spider and her six daughters control this region, and their mother has particular plans for the pig known as Zhu Bajie.\n\n* Rewards: Spider Leg, Refined Iron Sand, 3410 Experience, 2608 Will\n\n\nThe Violet Spider is a required and non-missable boss in Chapter 4. She is the final boss of the Webbed Hollow Section, and must be defeated to progress to the next area. After you have reached the Lower Hollow and defeated Zhu Bajie to free him of his bewitching curse, he'll be abducted again.\n\nTo reach him (and the Violet Spider), you'll need to ascend the Purfiying Spring outside the Hut of Immortality, and follow the trail upwards to The Gathering Cave where the spider queen awaits you.\n\n## Violet Spider Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe Violet Spider shares more than just the look of The Second Sister -- she also uses a few of the same moves with her talon-like appendages. This includes the feint of raising up her front leg to the side before performing alternating downward stabs, followed by a large leaping slam.\n\nThe bad news is even if you've gotten familiar with these attacks, she often follows them by spewing poison right onto the ground in front of her, which will limit your ability to retaliate. Be sure to dodge to the side first before starting your attack to get out of the way of most of her poison.",
