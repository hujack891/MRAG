Two enemies are visible: one on the ground path ahead and another positioned on a higher ledge. The interface displays the collection of an item, \"Aged Ginseng,\" and various player abilities or resources, suggesting gameplay elements such as combat preparation, exploration, and resource management.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text describes the next encounter in the Fright Cliff area, where the player faces a Pitstone enemy on the path ahead and a Blazebone enemy on a ledge to the right, the latter using projectiles to attack from a distance."
