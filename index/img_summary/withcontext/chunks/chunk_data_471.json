Below you'll find a guide to accessing the temple with all three bell locations, and how to defeat the secret Yaoguai King boss, Elder Jinchi.\n\nThis Chapter 1 Secret can only be accessed by ringing three large bells found around Black Wind Mountain, and will transport you to a different location to fight the secret boss that possess a magical item that is instrumental in defeating the Black Wind King.\n\n\n* **Bamboo Grove** \\- Traveling through the very short region of the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll have to defeat a character boss, the Whiteclad Noble. Once he retreats, look for a path off to the left instead of heading straight into Black Wind Cave, and you’ll find a large plaza past the marsh where several Wolf Guai sit before a wolf that has been hung from a tree. Just beyond them is the final bell.\n\n\nActivate the shrine in the entrance plaza, and then be sure to look around this area before proceeding inside. Opposite the Shrine, look around the other withered tree for three nearby chests that hold lots of Will, 2 **Yarn** , 3 **Stone Spirit** , and **Guanyin’s Prayer Beads** arm gear.\n\nYou will also find that unlike the rest of Chapter 1, the Keeper's Shrine here sells a unique selection in the shop only purchasable at this Secret Area, and it's worth stocking up on the items since they're pretty rare for this point in the game:\n\n| Ancient Guanyin Temple Shrine Shop | Ancient Guanyin Temple Shrine Shop |\n| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| Evil Repelling Medicament (x2)     | Longevity Decoction (x2)           |\n| Silk (x2)                          | Yaoguai Core (x2)                  |\n\nNote - Before facing this boss, be sure to defeat the optional **Wandering Wight** that is found in the Forest of Wolves region of Black Wind Mountain if you haven’t faced him already. Not only does he share many attacks with this secret boss, but defeating this one will cause the Wandering Wight to disappear, and you will not be able to gain the Curio and Spirit that the Wight drops.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Battle - Elder Jinchi\n\nIf you fought the Wandering Wight then the good news is you’ll have a good idea of what to expect in this fight, as he shares many of the same moves. That said, he does hit harder and can empower certain moves, so don’t assume this will be a cakewalk. You’ll want to have upgraded your staff after defeating the Whiteclad Noble to dish out more damage, and using the Wandering Wight’s Spirit on this guy can help tremendously.",
    "img_below_text": "The big twist on this fight that you’ll notice immediately is all the wandering bronze-colored corpses milling about the arena.

This means you can focus on attacking the boss without worrying about one of them randomly clawing at you, but there’s more to it than that.\n\nThough you can’t directly target them, you can kill them with a single swipe of your staff. Doing so will actually cause their spirit to be directly absorbed, and heal you for a small amount. It’s not enough that you should be turning your back to the boss to seek them out exactly, but there are situations where you’ll need to distance yourself from Jinchi’s tremor and earthquake attacks that provide a pause in combat where you might as well hit one nearby to get a bit of your health restored. That’s not all these corpses do, but we’ll get to the rest in a bit.",

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe Ancient Guanyin Temple is a secret area in Chapter 1 of *Black Myth: Wukong*, accessible by ringing three bells in Black Wind Mountain. It features a challenging boss battle against Elder Jinchi, the Yaoguai King, who holds a magical item crucial for progressing in the game. Players are advised to prepare by upgrading their gear and defeating the optional Wandering Wight boss for additional rewards and insight into Elder Jinchi's attack patterns.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the boss battle arena for Elder Jinchi, the Yaoguai King, in the Ancient Guanyin Temple. The player character is positioned in the foreground, holding a staff, while Elder Jinchi—a large, bronze-colored humanoid figure—looms menacingly in the background. Surrounding the arena are wandering bronze-colored corpses, which play a role in the fight by providing healing when defeated. The environment is dark and atmospheric, with ancient temple architecture visible in the background.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe fight against Elder Jinchi introduces wandering bronze-colored corpses that initially pose no threat but can be defeated to absorb their spirit and restore health. Players are encouraged to strategically use these corpses during pauses in combat caused by Jinchi's tremor and earthquake attacks. The corpses also serve additional functions later in the battle, adding complexity to the encounter."
