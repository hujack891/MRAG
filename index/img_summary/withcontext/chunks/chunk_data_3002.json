It is one of the harder Curios items to find as it is located within the secret area of Chapter 2.\n\nWith the Tiger Tally equipped, you will get the following buff: Upon successful hits with light attack combo, moderately increases attack for a short duration. This is a specialized effect, requiring a trigger to activate, but the damage buff is decent, and most of the time you will be landing a full light attack combo in a fight anyway.",

In this area, you will need to defeat another \"Tiger Vanguard\" to progress, which will drop the Curios.\n\nTo get access to the Kingdom of Sahali, you will need to complete the Drunken Boar quest and obtain the Sobering Stone, a Jade Lotus, and the Arhat Gold Piece. Our guide linked here, or our video guide below can help you get through this somewhat confusing quest.\n\nFor even more guides and tips on finding all the items, be sure to check out our other guides.
