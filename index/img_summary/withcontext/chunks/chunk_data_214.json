    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text describes the player's progression through the \"Bitter Lake\" region, culminating in an encounter with a Yaoguai Chief miniboss known as the Apramana Bat. This miniboss is a larger, more powerful version of the bat enemies encountered earlier. The text highlights its aerial attacks, such as a cross-slash projectile, and emphasizes the importance of timing and preparation, including the use of shock-quelling medicine.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts the Apramana Bat miniboss in the midst of battle, showcasing its menacing aerial form as it looms above the player. The player's interface is visible, displaying various items (e.g., Evil Repelling Medicament, Shock-Quelling Powder) and abilities (e.g., Rock Solid, Immobilize), which are likely used to counter the boss's attacks. The health bar at the bottom indicates the ongoing fight.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text provides additional details about the Apramana Bat's attack patterns. It describes a specific move where the bat extends its legs upward before slamming down with its talons. Successfully deflecting this attack using the \"Rock Solid\" ability will knock the bat out of the sky, creating an opportunity for the player to retaliate."
