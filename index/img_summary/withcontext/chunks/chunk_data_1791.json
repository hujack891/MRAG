    "img_above_text": "# King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince\n\nThe King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince are a required Yaoguai Chief miniboss that you can encounter in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong. As a required boss fight, you'll encounter them blocking the path leading out of the Sandgate Village, connecting to both the Fright Cliff and Crouching Tiger Temple.\n\n* Rewards: Pungent Flesh Chunk, Second Rat Prince Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Yaoguai Core x2, Silk x2, Stone Spirit x1, 1102 Experience, 1014 Will\n\n\nFrom the Sandgate Village Area, head up and to the right from the Village Entrance Shrine, right from the sealed town gate to find a Rat Governor and two two-headed Rat Captains guarding a low valley. To their right is a large door you can open, triggering the boss fight.\n\n## King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThere’s one very important thing to get out of the way before discussing the rest of the fight. Despite the name, the Rat King of Flowing Sands is not your true target, and in reality you can complete this battle as soon as you defeat his son, the Second Rat Prince. However, if you choose to engage in regicide yourself, know that the prince will become enraged at the death of his father, and will gain a massive damage increase with empowered moves. But for all this risk, there is a reward — defeating the empowered Rat Prince will allow you to absorb his Spirit to use in attacks, which you **can’t gain otherwise**!\n\nWhen the battle begins, you’ll notice that the King wisely does not try to fight you up close. He’ll scurry behind his son and out of sight while the Second Rat Prince tries to hold your attention with massive swings from his spiked mace. The King can even burrow underground, creating a trail of flying dirt as he tries to evade you.",
    "img_below_text": "Left to his own devices, he’ll most often emerge to scurry up one of the five large stone pillars in this boss arena, and begin pelting you with rocks from afar. One or two rocks won’t be lethal, but he can soon start to hurl a ton your way and stagger you when you’re trying to survive against the Prince.",
