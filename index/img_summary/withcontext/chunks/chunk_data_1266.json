Don’t get too enraptured that you miss a Poisestone along the walls trying to ambush you, though.\n\nUpon reaching the end of the large cave system where you’ll find the Mother of Stones, look for a large opening to the right to exit back outside and onto a cliff edge.

It doesn’t really move at all, but it has a lot of health to slowly chip through.\n\nWhat will fight you, however, is the army of Palestones you can spot embedded in the ground and walls all around you. Make no mistake, this will be an endurance battle, as you’ll need to survive repeated encounters with more and more Palestones.",
    "img_below_text": "After taking enough damage, the Mother of Stones will let out a roar, signaling a Palestone will quickly appear to defend her. That’s your cue to immediately break off your attack, regain your stamina, and be ready to dodge the incoming stone monster. Survival will hinge on how well you can deal with each wave while taking minimal damage, and understanding their melee and ranged attacks.",
