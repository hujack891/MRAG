    "img_above_text": "# Webbed Hollow - Lower Hollow Walkthrough\n\nThe Webbed Hollow is the second main area of Black Myth: Wukong's Chapter 4, concluding with the lower portion of the large underground cave system. Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nThe easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step. Cast it near the start of the rope bridge, and then sprint all the way to the other end, and don't try to staff spin if any arrows come your way, or you're likely to walk off the side by accident.\n\n\nRather helpfully, there's a brazier by a ledge nearby, and looking down you can find a spot to drop back down to the two bridges we noted at the start of the Lower Hollow, putting you quickly back on track to the main pathway.\n\n\nBe sure to climb back up the ledges (use a jumping heavy attack to gain height), and continue to follow this path to a flooded cave where this chapter's Frog Boss awaits.\n\n\nPast this foe, you'll enter another long dark tunnel, and you can find a Puppet Spider hanging up on the right above a green Wisp to absorb, and a patrolling Lantern Holder further down the tunnel.\n\n\nOnce you're ready, head through the gate to join the party, and it seems your just in time to meet the not-so-lucky groom.\n\n\nThere actually isn't anything more you can do in the Hut of Immortality, as all the doors are sealed. However, when you return to the Shrine outside, you'll find a new cave path has been carved out that leads outside to a large muddy hole.\n\nYour battle with Zhu Bajie isn't over. In fact -- it's about to get a whole lot harder.\n\n## Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie (Second Encounter)\n\nThis is because fighting in the mud will drastically slow any dodge roll you try to make to get out of the way of his attacks. You can alleviate this somewhat with the help of one of the Sages Relic's passive buffs, or a particular gourd soak, but they won't put you back on even footing.",
    "img_below_text": "This means you'll have to be even more precise in your dodging, and using spells like Immobilize, Rock Solid, or Cloud Step to avoid attacks you can't roll away from in time.\n\nThe most important thing to note is that the mud hinders your ability to dodge, but it does **not** slow your ability to sprint. This means there are several situations and attacks where it can be preferable to run instead of waiting for a last second evade, so try to remember that option during this fight.",
