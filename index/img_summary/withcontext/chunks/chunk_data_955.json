    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces the narrative of *Black Myth: Wukong*, focusing on Sun Wukong's initial defeat and subsequent entrapment inside a rock. It sets up the game's premise, where The Old Monkey recounts Wukong's tale and mentions the Six Senses of the Great Sage, which are tied to the game's progression. The section transitions into discussing the first ending, \"The (Bad) Default Ending,\" unlocked by skipping a hidden area.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts Sun Wukong surrounded by glowing, fragmented golden particles, suggesting a moment of collapse or transformation. Based on the context, this visual likely represents the culmination of the \"Bad Default Ending,\" where Wukong's body disintegrates and the Six Senses leave him, symbolizing his defeat or failure.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text describes the conclusion of the \"Bad Default Ending,\" where Wukong collapses in water after defeating the final boss, and the Six Senses leave his body. This signifies the game's narrative resolution for players who did not unlock the hidden area in Mount Mei."
