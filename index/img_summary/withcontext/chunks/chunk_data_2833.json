The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems.\n\n\nAs you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple. A long slope here will send you down to a large arena, and its here you'll have your second and final encounter with an old foe - the Venom Daoist.\n\n## Boss Fight - Venom Daoist (Second Encounter)\n\nIf his stance moves into holding both swords up high, he'll perform a similar combo string of four quick hits, followed by twirling both blades around him as moves forward to perform a final double slash that hits extremely hard -- again, making staying out of range your best bet.",
