This hidden beast lurks beneath the water and will try to catch you by surprise as much as it can.\n\n\nAs you approach it, you should see a small lot of bubbles coming up from the center of it. When you get closer to it, the Water-Wood Beast will appear.\n\n## Water-Wood Beast Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThis fight is where your transformations can really shine, particularly Red Tides. Because it's a wood beast, it's easy to set it on fire with Red Tides attacks. It's also useful to be able to use the heavy attack and dash forward to catch up with it. Once you've built enough focus, perform a heavy attack in Red Ties to knock it over and set it on fire.",
