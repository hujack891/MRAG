    "img_above_text": "# Stone Vanguard\n\nThe Stone Vanguard is a required Yaoguai King boss fight that you can encounter in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong. Located near the end of the Fright Cliff area, imposing Rock Guai sports a formidable defense and exploding attacks.\n\n* **Rewards:** Sterness of Stone, Mind Core x1, Yaoguai Core x2, 1652 Experience, 1366 Will\n\n\nLook for an archway on the left wall in this area to find this boss arena.\n\n## Stone Vanguard Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe Stone Vanguard is one of two bosses you must defeat to advance to the end of Chapter 2, and defeating it is no easy task. As a hulking monster of rock, the Stone Vanguard employs lots of tremor attacks and huge shockwaves whenever it slams its giant front arms down — which is most of the time. Cloud Step can be very useful for getting out of the way of incoming leaps, and then blindsiding it from the side to stagger it off of its current attack.\n\n### Secret - Get Help from the Shigandang\n\nIf you've collected all six Buddha Eyeballs, you can actually interact with the large rock to the left before engaging the Stone Vanguard. This will summon the mighty Shigandang boss to arise and immediately fight with the Stone Vanguard. The good news is he's a lot tougher than the Stone Vanguard, and will perform a flashy finisher to tear the other rock Guai to pieces, giving you all the rewards!",
    "img_below_text": "The bad news is once the Stone Vanguard is gone, the Shigandang will turn on you, and he is an extremely tough boss to fight this early, so only do this if you really don't want to fight the Stone Vanguard yourself! You can also resummon the Shigandang later for a fairer matchup once you've gotten stronger.",
