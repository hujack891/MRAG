    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text describes the player's progression through the Bishui Cave, including activating Keeper's Shrines, navigating slopes and paths, and collecting items like the Celestial Ribbon and Mind Core. It introduces the final Keeper's Shrine in the Corridor of Fire and Ice and sets up the encounter with the Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast, a challenging boss with fire-based attacks.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a dark, cavernous environment with contrasting elements of ice and lava, consistent with the Corridor of Fire and Ice. A character stands at the edge of a staircase, overlooking a lava-filled area and an icy structure in the distance. A red arrow highlights a frozen archway, suggesting an interactive or destructible element that is key to progressing in the area or the boss fight.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text explains that the frozen archway visible in the image can be broken by baiting the Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast into attacking it. This provides an opportunity to escape into the area beyond the archway and use a specific combat stance (Thrust Stance) to gain an advantage over the boss."
