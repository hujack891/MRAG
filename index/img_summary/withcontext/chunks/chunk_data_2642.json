You can find some Gentian plants around here as you exit, and up ahead you can find the Frost-Clad Path Shrine.\n\nLike the previous chapters, this shrine has a whole new store for you to browse, and you'll also be able to start investing in crafting the Ochre Armor Set and Rat Sage Staff (or possibly the Loongwreathe Staff as well if you defeated the Red Loong and Black Loong in the previous chapters).
