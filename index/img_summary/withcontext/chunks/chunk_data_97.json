After descending down past the Buddha's Right Hand and spying on the Spider Sisters, you can head down a long path with an optional passage through a fissure on the right.\n\nThis path will lead you to a ledge with an archer, and then right along the path above the main trail where the Lower Hollow Shrine is to where the frog boss waits in a flooded cavern. You can also climb up to the ledge from the Shrine by jumping and performing aerial heavy attacks.\n\n## Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw Boss Fight and Guide\n\nAfter taking a bit of damage, Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw will rear back and spew out poison while looking above. This will cause a literal poison rain to cascade down, covering a huge portion of the arena in toxicity that will build your poison meter at an alarming rate. It is sometimes possible to Pillar Stance out of the poison, but the frog's repeated attacks will likely knock you down anyway.",

Given that the frog can also do a regular spew of poison in a wide arc that creates more hazardous spots on the ground, it's often better to just rely on the pills rather than restricting your movement even more.\n\nIf you thought that was the extent of his moves, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. Perhaps you've been wondering ever since defeating Buddha's Right Hand where the other hand went? Turns out, it's inside Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw!",
