The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems.\n\n\nAs you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple. A long slope here will send you down to a large arena, and its here you'll have your second and final encounter with an old foe - the Venom Daoist.\n\n\nBefore you do, you should also head through the nearby gateway to find a large field with a giant tree in the middle. Off on the right, you can find a wooden ledge overlooking the mountains with a **Treasure Chest** full of random materials and a Soul Remigration Pill.\n\n\nHead back to the altar, and pluck what should be the fourth and final talisman. Before you can celebrate this act, a large winged monster with a hand for a face will appear to aggressively punish you for this deed!\n\n\nNow that you've done all there is to do here, you can return to rest at the Shrine, and head toward the large field to finally catch up to the Violet Spider and her master, the Hundred-Eyed Daoist.\n\n## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master\n\nOnce it hits, he'll be knocked to the ground, the curse will be broken, and you'll get a massive opportunity to attack him with everything you've got! Still, don't expect him to go down without a fight after the stun wears off. He's got more tricks than ever, and is able to create huge blasts that can end the fight quickly if you don't react fast.",
    "img_below_text": "His most common attack comes when he spreads his hands wide as they glow yellow. He'll lunge toward you, bringing up both hands to create a giant tremor in front of him, but it can be deflected with Rock Solid (he'll no longer burrow to retaliate so that's one less thing to worry about).",
