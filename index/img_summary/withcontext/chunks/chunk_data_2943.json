This multi-phase battle is a challenging fight that brings you toward the conclusion of the game.\n\n\nAfter another story from Zhu Bajie, the giant staff will shrink and you'll be able to get it from the body of water in front of you. Now that you've acquired the Jingubang and look exactly like Wukong, head to the back of the cave directly ahead.\n\nFollow the path to the peak, where you'll come to the Return Path Keeper's Shrine.\n\n\nWhen you emerge on the other side, you'll see the final stretch of the path that dips down and then slopes upward. Head for the top and activate the Peak of Innocence Keeper's Shrine, just before the end of the path.\n\n\nOn the other side, you'll find the Old Monkey. He'll tell you to step onto a boat, and then transport you across the water, while he recites the memories of Wukong.\n\n## Birthstone - Heart of Birthstone\n\nWhen the boat ride is over, you'll be at the Birthstone portion of the Water Curtain Cave.
