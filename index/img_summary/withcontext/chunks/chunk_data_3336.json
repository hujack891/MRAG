    "img_above_text": "# Webbed Hollow - Lower Hollow Walkthrough\n\nThe Webbed Hollow is the second main area of Black Myth: Wukong's Chapter 4, concluding with the lower portion of the large underground cave system. Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nThe easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step. Cast it near the start of the rope bridge, and then sprint all the way to the other end, and don't try to staff spin if any arrows come your way, or you're likely to walk off the side by accident.\n\n\nRather helpfully, there's a brazier by a ledge nearby, and looking down you can find a spot to drop back down to the two bridges we noted at the start of the Lower Hollow, putting you quickly back on track to the main pathway.\n\n## Lower Hollow\n\nOnce you reach the bottom, you'll find a passageway to a wooden ledge overlooking a home set around a large purple-flowering tree. You're just in time to see the Second Sister return with a very docile Zhu Bajie, completely under a spell thanks to the Sage's Relic. It seems he's all set to be married to the mother of spiders, which doesn't really sound good.",
