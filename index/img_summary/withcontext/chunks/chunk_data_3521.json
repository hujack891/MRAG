You'll find him guarding the end of the Marsh of White Mist in the Bamboo Grove, past where you save and befriend the Shen Monkey that can upgrade your Gourd.\n\nYou'll find him at the bottom of the ramp across a large flooded marsh area lined with reeds.\n\n## Whiteclad Noble Boss Fight and Guide\n\nFor phase two, you’ll find that many of his attacks are pretty similar to the first phase, and he doesn’t have too many extra surprises up his sleeve. Due to his new posture, his 360 degree circle spin attack is a bit harder to see coming as his spear will dip into the water, so you’ll need to watch him moves carefully.\n\nSometimes, he’ll raise his spear higher, and will do a frontal sweep rather than his spin, but his snake body will quickly slither off before you can counter, meaning you’ll have to Immobilize him instead or quickly follow him.",
