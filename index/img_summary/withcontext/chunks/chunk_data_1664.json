Getting to the boss, however, requires finding a key item that you can't get until Chapter 2. This isn't the only Loong boss you can find in the game, so if you want to access the secret area, and know the whereabouts of the Loong Dragon Bosses, here's everything you need to know.\n\n* How to Get the Loong Scales\n* How to Find the Chapter 1 Secret Dragon Boss\n* How to Find the Chapter 2 Secret Boss\n* How to Find Chapter 3 Dragon Boss\n* How to Find the Chapter 4 Secret Boss\n\n\nOnce you've picked them up from the treasure chest, a voice will begin speaking to you. This will also happen when you're near the bosses, but now that you've collected the Loong Scales, you're ready to unlock some secret areas!\n\n\nGo toward it and through it to enter the secret Loong Claw Grove area to fight Red Loong.\n\n\nBeyond this enemy, you'll see a sandfall.
