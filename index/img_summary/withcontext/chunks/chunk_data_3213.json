    "img_above_text": "# Village of Lanxi Walkthrough\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong's Chapter 4 begins in the darkened outskirts of the Village of Lanxi where the mysterious Webbed Hollow is rumored to be. Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of The Webbed Hollow: the Village of Lanxi, as well as how to navigate the town and defeat the Second Sister.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Estate of the Zhu**\n- Yaoguai Chief - The Second Sister\n\n\nHead down the sloping street and grab a green Wisp along the way, and you'll find yourself crossing a small bridge to a clearing with a shack covered in webs. Standing our front are two Grasshopper Guai that can strike extremely quickly, but aren't as durable as the Beetle Captain.\n\nClear them out with Zhu Bajie's help, and you'll find they were guarding a large **Treasure Chest** holding several consumables, which may include a Loong Aura Amplification Pellet, as well as a Knot of Voidness and Blood of the Iron Bull.\n\n\nJust up the stairs from the Shrine is a door, so once you've made all your purchases, upgraded gear, and given the Zodiac Village another visit, you can try knocking on the door.\n\nZhu Bajie will suggest a bit of subterfuge, disguising yourselves as the Wushan Lesser Guai who were hauling the chest at the start of the chapter. You'll be met by a shrewd woman, who will immediately figure out the little pig's disguise. She happens to have a disguise of her own, and will transform into her true self.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - The Second Sister\n\nTaking the form of a giant venomous spider, The Second Sister isn't the toughest boss you'll have faced thus far, but her many legs can sometimes make her movements and attacks hard to read. Luckily, with Zhu Bajie on your side, you'll be able to team up and keep her on the defensive. Make use of the Shrine's store to stock up on Antimiasma Powder.",
    "img_below_text": "Most of The Second Sister's main attack will come from her two front razor-sharp legs, and will be where you will want to focus the bulk (but not all) of your attention. She may often begin the fight by raising up one talon high up to the side, slice down with her two front legs in quick succession, and then rise up into the air to slam down after a delay.\n\nAnother move she can use at close range is to raise most of her body up on her back legs, and dance down upon you with her front talons to stab the ground multiple times in quick succession. Since it's hard to evade each blow individually, consider using the Thrust Stance to retreat and strike from a distance.",
