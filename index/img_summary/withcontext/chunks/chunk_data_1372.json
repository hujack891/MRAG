    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe walkthrough guides the player to activate the Rakshasa Palace Keeper's Shrine after opening a giant door at the top of the stairs. It then instructs the player to explore the area near the lava before ascending the steps, suggesting that exploration is key to progressing in the Rakshasa Palace section.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a character walking through a lava-filled area beneath a curved bridge. A glowing green object, marked with a red circle, is visible under the bridge, indicating a collectible or interactable item. The scene emphasizes exploration in a hazardous environment, aligning with the instructions in the walkthrough.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe walkthrough advises the player to first explore the left side of the lava area, where they will encounter a Bull Soldier enemy. It also highlights the importance of checking beneath the curved portion of the bridge to absorb a green Wisp, which is likely the glowing object shown in the image."
