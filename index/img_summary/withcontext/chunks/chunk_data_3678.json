Hiding across several rope bridges outside the middle of the Webbed Hollow, this boss can't be activated until you obtain a Key Item in the previous chapter. Yellow Loong is the final of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n\n* Rewards: Golden Lining Transformation Spell, Sea-Supporting Tendon, Golden Carp Curio, Kun Steel, Loong Pearl, Mind Core, 6998 Experience, 5049 Will\n\n\nYou can enter the crack in the wall, and on the other side you’ll find a chest containing the Loong Scales. With this item, you’ll be able to unlock the boss.\n\n## Yellow Loong Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe first half of this fight will largely come down to learning these moves and how best to avoid them, and chain together counters to keep him staggered. You can offload a lot of damage early before he starts using his bigger moves by chaining initial light combo attacks to build your Focus past three points, Rock Solid deflect to fill the fourth meter and chain that into a heavy attack riposte with either the Thrust or Pillar Stance.",
    "img_below_text": "When he staggers back, follow up with a quick but damaging Spirit Attack to keep him staggered (something like the Earth Wolf can deal a lot if you get him cornered against a wall where you'll keep running into him), and then swap into a Transformation Spell to keep him on the defensive.\n\nTake care when using your Transformation Spells to maximize damage by not being too reckless, and conserve might and health by dodging anything he throws out. The Umbral Abyss is a good pick since you can attack right as you transform, and use the spell at full might to further stun and chill him.",
