Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n## Cliff of Oblivion\n\nTo make matters worse, there's no invisible walls to stop you from falling to your death when crossing the bridge, which the Clawed Cocoons AND Dragonfly Guai archer at the far end will absolutely use to their advantage to knock you around as you try to cross. While you can use the Thrust Stance to safely poke a few early cocoons, the strategy won't hold very long, and it's almost impossible to target the actual enemies and not the regular cocoons.",
    "img_below_text": "The easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step.
