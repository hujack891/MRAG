    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text describes the exploration of the Squall Hideout, a cave system in the \"Fright Cliff Walkthrough.\" Players encounter various enemies, including Spearbones and Blazebones, and collect items like Silk, Yaoguai Core, and Tiny Pieces of Gold. At the end of the cave, players meet the Man-in-Stone, who requests help in reversing his curse. This leads to a mini-boss fight with the Mother of Stones, a relatively weak Yaoguai Chief.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a player character interacting with a glowing, crystalline structure embedded in a rocky, organic-looking surface. The structure appears to be tied to the \"Mother of Stones\" mini-boss encounter, as it visually aligns with the description of a large statue embedded with shining blue crystals. The interaction likely represents a key moment in the quest, such as harvesting an item or triggering an event.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text explains the aftermath of defeating the Mother of Stones. The Man-in-Stone realizes his mistakes, rewards the player with the Azure Dust Transformation Spell, and offers to sell high-priced goods in the future. The spell grants the ability to transform into a Rock Guai, providing immense power and status immunity but at the cost of mobility."
