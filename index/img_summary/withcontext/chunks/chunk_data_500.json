Below you'll find a guide to accessing the kingdom of the past by undertaking the Drunk Boar's Questline to find a Sobering Stone, and how to defeat the Tiger Vanguard and secret Yaoguai King Boss, Fuban.\n\n* Jump to a Section:\n* **How to Access the Kingdom of Sahali**\n- Yaoguai Chief - \"Tiger Vanguard\"\n* **Sandgate Bound**\n- Yaoguai King - Fuban\n\nThis Chapter 2 Secret can only be accessed by meeting the Yellow-Robed Square in Fright Cliff (aka the Drunken Boar), and helping him in his search for the \"Realm of Gold\" which requires a few steps (and for you to best him in combat).\n\n\nOnce you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into the Kingdom of Sahali\n\n\nAs you round the corner, you’ll be told to halt by the defender of a large gate: A slightly familiar looking Tiger Guai who calls himself the Vanguard of the Yellow Wind King. If he looks familiar to another Vanguard you’ve faced, that’s because he’s actually the other Vanguard’s father! He’ll ask that you turn around and head home, which seems like such a waste with all you’ve gone through just to get here.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - \"Tiger Vanguard\" (Kingdom of Sahali)\n\nOne powerful (yet deflectable) attack he can also employ has a long wind up as he’ll drag his sword slowly along the ground, building up friction and sparks as he drags it to you before ripping the blade up. Rock Solid can stop the attack but won’t always stagger him, but it’s easier to see coming than other moves.",
    "img_below_text": "As for his more unique attacks, watch for the Tiger Vanguard to raise his hands up, as he’ll then let loose an incredibly powerful roar that will damage you, and cause rock explosions all around him. This one can be very tough to dodge considering the range and how quickly he goes into the roar, but you can stop him short by Immobilizing him and then dealing enough damage to stagger him and prevent the roar altogether.\n\nSince he’s not as powerful or varied as the Vanguard of the Crouching Tiger Temple, nor is he as unrelentingly powerful as the Mad Tiger below the well, he shouldn’t give you as much problems as his sons. Remember to try switching up your stances — especially to the Thrust Stance — if you want to play it safe with longer range heavy strikes out of his reach.",

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text introduces the Kingdom of Sahali as a secret area in Chapter 2 of *Black Myth Wukong*. Players access this area by completing the Drunk Boar's Questline and entering a gate that transports them to the past. Upon arrival, they encounter the Tiger Vanguard, a mini-boss guarding a large gate, who challenges the player to a fight.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts an intense moment during the Tiger Vanguard mini-boss fight. The Tiger Vanguard, a large humanoid tiger wielding a weapon, is unleashing a powerful attack, causing an explosion of rocks and debris. The player character is shown in the foreground, preparing to engage, with the boss's health bar visible at the bottom of the screen.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text details the Tiger Vanguard's unique attacks, including a damaging roar that triggers rock explosions. Players are advised to immobilize and stagger him to interrupt this move. The text also compares him to other vanguards, noting that he is less powerful and suggests using the Thrust Stance for safer, long-range attacks."
