It can be tricky to defeat as it's very fast, very strong, has some very hard-hitting attacks, and even has an army of minions on call. You can expect to see lots of belly-flop moves where the beast smashes its huge body into the ground multiple times, a roll-attack where it curls up into a ball and crashes around the arena, and a poison spray move where it spews pools of poison onto the ground.",
    "img_below_text": "The worst attack of all, however, occurs when the creature lets out a massive scream that summons a horde of small centipedes that explode on impact. Sprint and dodge out of the way to avoid the onslaught of poison. Bring some Antimiasma Powder just in case you need it.",
