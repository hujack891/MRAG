    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces Flint Vanguard as an optional boss fight in Chapter 5 of the game Black Myth: Wukong. It is one of the stone bosses that drops a Samadhi Fire Crystal. The text explains that after overcoming a challenge involving a spiked golden ball in Ashen Pass III, players can access the Cooling Slope area, which was previously blocked by a firewall.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a rocky landscape with a path leading through it. There is a notable pile of rocks, marked by an arrow, which is likely indicative of the Flint Vanguard boss location. The surrounding environment is dark and rugged, with lava flows visible, suggesting a volcanic or fiery setting consistent with the game's narrative.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text provides additional details about the Cooling Slope area, highlighting two points of interest upon entering: a smattering of rocks ahead, which is the location of the Flint Vanguard boss, and a Luoija Fragrant Vine to the left. This information helps players identify the boss's location and navigate the area effectively."
