    "img_above_text": "# Violet Spider\n\nThe Violet Spider is a main Yaoguai \"Queen\" boss fight that you can encounter in Chapter 4 of Black Myth Wukong. The leader of the Spider Guai and master of The Webbed Hollow, the Violet Spider and her six daughters control this region, and their mother has particular plans for the pig known as Zhu Bajie.\n\n* Rewards: Spider Leg, Refined Iron Sand, 3410 Experience, 2608 Will\n\n\nThe Violet Spider is a required and non-missable boss in Chapter 4. She is the final boss of the Webbed Hollow Section, and must be defeated to progress to the next area. After you have reached the Lower Hollow and defeated Zhu Bajie to free him of his bewitching curse, he'll be abducted again.\n\nTo reach him (and the Violet Spider), you'll need to ascend the Purfiying Spring outside the Hut of Immortality, and follow the trail upwards to The Gathering Cave where the spider queen awaits you.\n\n## Violet Spider Boss Fight and Guide\n\nOne of her more insidious moves is another play on her webbing attack, where she'll laugh as she sends out strands from her back to slowly arc across the air and seek you out. She'll send these webbing strands out one after the other to try and both slow you down and also deal damage, ending with a huge wave of 12 projectiles in a large arc that all fly to you at once. If you're stuck trying to get out of her earlier webbing, you'll be a sitting duck, making evading the last salvo even harder.",
    "img_below_text": "Luckily, these strands all count as projectiles that can be deflected, meaning you need only stand your ground and spin your staff to knock each webbing projectile away as it comes, letting you evade both getting stuck and taking damage all at once.\n\nRather annoyingly, while most attacks can be deflected with Rock Solid easily, they'll cause her to retreat backward by a good amount, and out of range or regular retaliations. It's better that you build up your Focus Points before trying to deflect her attack, and then immediately follow with a high powered heavy strike with your thrust or pillar stance to catch her as she retreats.",
