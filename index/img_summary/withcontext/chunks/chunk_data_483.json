    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text introduces the Kingdom of Sahali as a secret area in Chapter 2 of *Black Myth: Wukong*. Accessing this area involves completing the Drunk Boar's questline, which requires finding a Sobering Stone to help the boar-like character sober up. The quest begins in the Yellow Wind Ridge and hints at the location of the required item, \"Windrest.\"\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a player character in a detailed environment, holding a staff and standing near a glowing object resembling a treasure or artifact. The setting includes rocky terrain, tall grass, and a lit brazier in the background, suggesting a cave or secluded area. The text overlay in the image reads, \"Ye are surely a gullible one! I've finally got me hands on the treasure!\" This indicates a narrative moment where a character reveals their deception or triumph after acquiring a valuable item.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text provides additional information about obtaining the Sobering Stone. It mentions that the item can be purchased from the Man-in-Stone if the player's questline with him is completed, offering an alternative to exploration for acquiring the necessary item."
