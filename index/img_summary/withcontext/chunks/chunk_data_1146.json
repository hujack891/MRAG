    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text provides guidance on progressing through the Foothills area, including defeating minibosses like the Poison Chiefs and activating Keeper's Shrines. It introduces the Deer Sight Forest section, where players encounter the Yaoguai Chief, Cloudtreading Deer, and outlines strategies to defeat it, such as avoiding poison patches and using specific tools like the Wind Vessel.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a player character hovering above a forested mountainous landscape, with a red arrow pointing toward a distant clearing. This visual likely serves as a navigational aid, directing players toward the location of the Cloudtreading Deer in the Deer Sight Forest. The environment matches the described setting of cliffs, trees, and open spaces.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text instructs players to return to the Keeper's Shrine after defeating the Cloudtreading Deer. It then guides them to fly toward a tall white tree near a rocky cliff clearing, where the final Poison Chief can be found. This continues the walkthrough's progression through the Foothills area."
