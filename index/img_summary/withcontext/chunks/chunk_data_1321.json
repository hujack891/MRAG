    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces Fuban, a secret optional Yaoguai King boss encountered in Chapter 2 of *Black Myth: Wukong*. To access the fight, players must fulfill a quest involving a drunken Boar and travel to the Kingdom of Sahali, a forgotten realm locked in the past. The fight rewards players with items like the Wind Tamer and Sky-Piercing Horn. The text also describes Fuban's attack pattern, where it pierces upward with its horn from beneath the sand, and suggests using the Pillar Stance to avoid damage.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the Fuban boss fight in a sandy battlefield. Fuban, a massive creature, is erupting from the ground, scattering debris and sand while attempting to attack the player character. The player, armed with a weapon, is positioned in the foreground, seemingly evading the attack. The interface shows health bars, abilities, and stamina indicators, emphasizing the combat mechanics of the encounter.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text elaborates on Fuban's attack patterns, describing how it continues its underground assaults by repeatedly moving its horn up and down through the sand. Players are advised to keep dodging to avoid damage and stay out of the path of the horn's movements."
