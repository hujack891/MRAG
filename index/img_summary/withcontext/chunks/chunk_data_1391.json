    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text describes the events leading up to the exploration of The Emerald Hall. After defeating two of the Five Element Carts, the player revisits key locations and NPCs to progress the story. Upon entering The Emerald Hall, a cutscene triggers where the player transforms into a Cicada and witnesses a confrontation involving Pingping, Rakshasi, and the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains. This culminates in a boss battle against the Keeper and Ma Tianba.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts an altar in The Emerald Hall, surrounded by ornate decorations and lit candles. A glowing object, highlighted by a red dashed circle, is visible on the altar, suggesting it is an interactable or collectible item. A character stands in the foreground, equipped with a weapon, indicating the playerâ€™s presence and readiness to engage with the environment.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text instructs the player to return to the altar in The Emerald Hall, near the respawn point, to collect the \"Loong Balm\" drink.
