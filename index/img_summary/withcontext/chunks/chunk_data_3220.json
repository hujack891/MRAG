Standing our front are two Grasshopper Guai that can strike extremely quickly, but aren't as durable as the Beetle Captain.\n\nClear them out with Zhu Bajie's help, and you'll find they were guarding a large **Treasure Chest** holding several consumables, which may include a Loong Aura Amplification Pellet, as well as a Knot of Voidness and Blood of the Iron Bull.\n\n\nJust up the stairs from the Shrine is a door, so once you've made all your purchases, upgraded gear, and given the Zodiac Village another visit, you can try knocking on the door.\n\nZhu Bajie will suggest a bit of subterfuge, disguising yourselves as the Wushan Lesser Guai who were hauling the chest at the start of the chapter. You'll be met by a shrewd woman, who will immediately figure out the little pig's disguise. She happens to have a disguise of her own, and will transform into her true self.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - The Second Sister\n\nAnother move can often happen when trying to flank her or attack on other sides, as she'll simply raise her body up high, and then slam down to the ground to deal massive damage on all sides.",
