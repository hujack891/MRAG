The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems.\n\n\nAs you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple. A long slope here will send you down to a large arena, and its here you'll have your second and final encounter with an old foe - the Venom Daoist.\n\n## Boss Fight - Venom Daoist (Second Encounter)\n\nTaking off one of his arms will deal a chunk of damage, but if you can try targeting both of his extra arms, removing them both will instantly deplete his health, and begin the second phase where demands a true fight: two arms vs two arms.\n\nHe's got a lot more aggressive moves for this phase, and you'll need to be a bit more cautious as he has a lot less openings to retaliate than before.",
