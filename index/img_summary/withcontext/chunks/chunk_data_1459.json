    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe Gray-Bronze Cart is a Yaoguai Chief boss encountered at the start of Chapter 5 in *Black Myth: Wukong*. It blocks the pathway to the Ashen Pass II and is one of the Five Element Carts players must defeat. The text advises approaching the narrow path leading to the cart and highlights an alcove to the left where players can avoid fire attacks and find a green Wisp.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a narrow, rocky pathway leading to the Gray-Bronze Cart boss, a large, menacing figure with fiery features. The environment is dark and foreboding, with intricate carvings on the walls. A red arrow points to an alcove on the left side of the path, indicating a safe spot for avoiding fire attacks during the fight.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text explains that all Five Element Carts share a similar moveset, making the Fireproof Mantle Vessel highly effective. For the Gray-Bronze Cart specifically, players are advised to stay close during non-fire attacks like the fist slam but retreat to the alcove when the cart rears up to unleash fire attacks."
