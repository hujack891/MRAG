A purple magic seal can be found on the next cell along, and as you explore the area, you’ll start to see more of them. With NPCs and items to find behind these locked doors, it’s worth spending the time finding how to unlock them. On this page, we’ll break down how to find the boss you need to get the item that will allow you to do so.\n\n## How to Remove the Purple Magic Seals on the Prison Cells in Chapter 3\n\nWhen you first wake up in the jail cell in the Pagoda Realm of the New West region, there will be nowhere to go but outside to the long ledge that wraps around the huge room. Head left from the cell, and you’ll find another one next door to yours. This one has a **purple circle magic seal** on the outside, preventing you from getting into it. You will, however, find an NPC inside that you can speak to.\n\nWith nothing else to do here for now, you’ll want to continue along the ledge (past the Lantern Wardens if the room is in its greyish haze) toward the first Keeper’s Shrine of the realm. Just before the shrine, you’ll see another one of the locked purple doors.",
