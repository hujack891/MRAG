    "img_above_text": "# Valley of Ecstasy Walkthrough\n\nThe Valley of Ecstasy is the fourth main region of Chapter 3 in The New West in Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide for the Valley of Ecstasy Region, including how to reach the valley itself by defeating Non-White, and exploring the different parts of the valley to uncover several Yaoguai Chiefs on the path to the New Thunderclap Temple, and completing the Treasure Hunter's Quest and the Pagoda Realm Prisoner's Quest by defeating the final Captain.\n\n- **Jump to a Section:**\n- **Mindfulness Cliff**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-White (Round Two)\n- **Forest of Felicity**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang\n- **Brook of Bliss**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Able\n- **Towers of Karma**\n- Yauoguai Chief - Old Ginseng Guai\n- **Longevity Road**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Captain Kalpa-Wave\n\nAfter you solved the monk's riddle by praying at four Buddha Statues in the Precept Corridor, you'll split up from Zhu Bajie and make your way into the belly button of a large Buddha statue along the cliffs, taking you up a narrow pathway and into the Mindfulness Cliff.\n\n\nFrom the Shrine, you'll find yourself at the edge of a large pit with a pathway spiraling around its edge.\n\nHowever, as you begin to head up the path around the pit, you'll be interrupted by the arrival of a jester-like figure who wants to wear your face.\n\n\nContinue taking the path back outside and up the cliffs to reach a large open area with an archway at the far end leading to a huge valley, and on the right you'll find Non-White at a Meditation Spot waiting for round two.\n\n\nBeyond this arena, you can head through an archway to see the giant titular Valley of Ecstasy below you. It's a one-way slide, and the region is about to get a whole lot bigger and confusing.\n\n## Forest of Felicity\n\n* You'll start in the **Forest of Felicity** , which with your back to the slope, comprises much of the area directly in front of you that includes a winding main path through this region, and also a hidden canyon to the left.\n* A large sloping hill to the right of the Shrine leads down to the **Brook of Bliss** , where a sizable and traversable river cuts through this part of the valley, leading to a cliff with a secret cave underneath.\n* Ahead of the forest is a second lower valley to the left as the main path cuts right, leading to the **Towers of Karma** area and a large forested field.\n* Following the main path as it crosses a high road between the brook and towers leads beyond a giant guarded archway to **Longevity Road** , which has its own optional forests and fields on both sides as the central path leads on to New Thunderclap Temple.\n\nOf course, you're free to explore as much (or as little) of these sub-regions of the valley as you'd like, but with the amount of questlines and yaoguai chiefs to find in each spot, we'll be covering each of them.\n\n### The Snow Fox's Quest\nNot far from the Forest Shrine, look for a small arch along the main path, and you'll find a unique corpse sitting along the wood posts that looks different from the rest. You can interact to hear a voice -- coming not from the body, but from the fox pelt around its neck. Apparently that story about the snow fox and the human you saw after completing Chapter 2 actually happened, and the fox guai wants revenge.\nShe'll gift you the Snow Fox Brush, allowing you to take the form of the Snow Fox and seek out the human scholar who resides in New Thunderclap Temple.\nHowever, it's a long road to get there, and you can't attack in this form, so for now it's better that you De-transform, and use the key item later on when you're close to your target.",
