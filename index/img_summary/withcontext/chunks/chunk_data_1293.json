On the plus side, you’ll be immune to all status effects while transformed, and deal incredible damage that staggers most enemies. Instead of Might building on attack, you’ll build it while taking damage, allowing you to soak blows and unleash a powerful jump attack spell in return!\n\nAs an added bonus, if you keep hassling the Man-in-Stone, he’ll promise to prepare wares to sell the next time you visit.

Just remember that you only build Might by getting hit, and the slow pace of his attacks may make that hard unless he’s going for his more rapid arm stamping attack.

Draw close, and you’ll be able to interact with it, inserting the six Buddha Eyeballs you gained from the statue heads around the Fright Cliff. Doing so will unlock the Shigandang secret boss battle.

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text describes the \"Fright Cliff Walkthrough,\" focusing on the Rock Clash Platform section. It highlights the use of the Azure Dust Transformation Spell to transform into the Rock Guai, a slow but powerful form that builds Might by taking damage. The text also mentions defeating the Stone Vanguard boss and hints at a secret boss, Shigandang, unlocked by interacting with a carved stone near the arena entrance.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a player character in a rugged, rocky environment, armed with a staff-like weapon and engaging zombie-like enemies (Withered Corpses). The setting includes dilapidated shacks, scattered flames, and a barren landscape, aligning with the description of the Rock Clash Platform. The player's HUD is visible, suggesting active gameplay.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text continues the walkthrough, describing the path beyond the Rock Clash Platform. It leads to a terrace overlooking a ravine with a swirling black tornado. This area is guarded by a Rat Governor, a challenging enemy with lightning-based attacks and the ability to create damaging copies of itself. Defeating this foe grants the Rat Governor Spirit, enabling the player to perform electric attacks."
