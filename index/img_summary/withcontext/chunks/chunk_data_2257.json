    "img_above_text": "# Old Rattle-Drum Questline\n\nThe Rattle-Drum Questline is a hidden side quest in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong, and involves using a specific Old Rattle-Drum Key Item to communicate with the spirit of a boy, and unlock a hidden boss - the Mad Tiger.\n\n\nThis secret questline can begin once you obtain the **Old-Rattle Drum Key Item**. It is dropped by a Yaoguai Chief Miniboss called the Tiger’s Acolyte. This boss battle can be found at the far end of the Yellow Wind Formation region, at the very end of the **Windrest Hamlet** along a large stone bridge leading back to the Fright Cliff region.\n\nAfter defeating the Tiger’s Acolyte, you’ll gain the Old-Rattle Drum, which appears to have belonged to the Acolyte’s son, but no other details are provided. You will need to find three areas where you can use the drum to summon a spirit, in **locations all across the Yellow Wind Ridge**. The only clue you’ll have is that entering the correct area will **cause your vision to warp** , and the ghostly voice of a boy calling out to you.\n\n\nThe first location you can use the Old-Rattle Drum is close to where you fought the Tiger’s Acolyte, further back in the **Windrest Hamlet**. Return across the bridge to the **Windrest Hamlet Shrine** and pass back through the large gate, immediately taking a left to the **large house surrounded by sitting Withering Corpses**.\n\nA visual cue will appear along with the **voice of a child** beckoning you, and you’ll be able to use the Rattle-Drum in front of the house. Be warned, as doing so will provoke all the nearby corpses to attack you, but you’ll also get some interesting dialogue from the child.\n\n\nOn the other side of the ruined building, there’s a long roof-like walkway and several Withering Corpses milling about, along with a Ginsengling hiding by a wooden chest. If you already used the Old Rattle-Drum back in Windrest Hamlet, you’ll again hear the spirit of a boy call out to you. Use the drum here, and prepare to fend off the zombies as he speaks to you. Interestingly, he mentions a **secret and a well** before clamming up, giving you one final clue to the third location.\n\n\nUnfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there. You can interact with the well to drop down to a secret area, where you’ll face off against an incredibly tough and dangerous secret boss, the **Mad Tiger**.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Battle - Mad Tiger\n\nExpect this fight to take a lot of practice, and considerable upgrades in skills on your part to deal enough damage to survive the fight. While most Rock Solid deflections won’t be enough to stop him, retaliating with charged heavy strikes or crashing an Immobilize can sometimes stagger him several times and give you several openings. Using the Azure Dust Transformation is also useful to soak up his most damaging combos and retaliate with heavy charged hits to take chunks off his health.\n\nKeep practicing against dodging his moves, finding the right times to deflect the end of his combos (or just use Cloud Step to get out of the way) and always watch carefully when you stagger him to avoid his rising grab. Having the concoction to increase your max health can be beneficial if you’re unable to evade his grab or lengthy combos.",
