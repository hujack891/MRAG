Below you'll find a guide for the first upper area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find your first encounter with the Venom Daoist, and the different ways to reach The Verdure Bridge.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Upper Hollow**\n* **Pool of Shattered Jade**\n- Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nBefore following the golden trail of a nearby Shrine, look to the left of the bed and small chest to find a path leading to another larger **Treasure Chest** you can open to claim a **Cuo Jin-Yin Belt Hook Curio** , another item that can help resist all the poison you'll be encountering.\n\n## Upper Hollow\n\nJust to the right of this ledge, there's a small cave lined with tiny cocoons everywhere, and a few medium-sized cocoons that will burst to reveal ugly looking Minor Amourworms. They can't do too much other than thrash about or lunge (a surprisingly long distance in a short span), but the one you'll want to worry about is the larger cocoon in the middle that holds a Lesser Amourworm.",
