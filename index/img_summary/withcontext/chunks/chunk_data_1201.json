    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text introduces the setting of \"The Forest of Wolves,\" where players progress through a shrine system that acts as checkpoints. After meeting the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain, players receive the Incense Trail Talisman, which allows them to warp between shrines. The journey leads to the \"Front Hills,\" where players encounter their first mini-boss, the Yaoguai Chief, known as Bullguard. The text describes the boss's attack patterns, emphasizing the need for strategic dodging.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts the Yaoguai Chief, Bullguard, in an intense combat moment. The creature has a menacing appearance, with a muscular build, glowing horns, and a weapon raised in an aggressive stance. The dark, forested background and dynamic lighting emphasize the boss's ferocity, highlighting the high-stakes nature of the encounter.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text describes the progression of the fight with Bullguard. Once his health is reduced to half, he counters the player’s attack, but the Keeper intervenes with an immobilization spell. The Keeper then transfers this spell, \"Immobilize,\" to the player, allowing them to temporarily bind enemies. The text warns that stronger foes, like Bullguard, can break free quickly, and some bosses may resist the spell entirely."
