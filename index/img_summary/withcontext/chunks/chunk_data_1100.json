    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text describes the progression through the Verdant Path section of the Foothills Walkthrough. It highlights a battle against the Supreme Celestial Inspector, who introduces new mechanics such as arena reduction and dual swords. After defeating the Inspector, the player gains access to Wukong's Somersault Cloud ability, enabling exploration of elevated areas.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a character hovering on a cloud (likely Wukong's Somersault Cloud) above a rocky, forested area. The environment features moss-covered rocks and dense trees, with a red arrow pointing toward a curved tree. The image serves as a visual guide to indicate the location of a secret chest, accessible by flying above the starting path of the level.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text instructs the player to land behind the curved tree shown in the image to find a hidden chest. This provides a reward for exploring the area using the Somersault Cloud ability."
