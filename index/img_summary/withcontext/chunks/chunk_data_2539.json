An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.\n\n\nKeep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier.\n\n\nNow it’s time to finally open that door the Rat Captains were guarding. In the next scene, you’ll spot the next major boss fight: a tiny Rat King and his oversized son.\n\n\nAnother terrifying new move is for him to do a slow spin ending with a weapon toss right at you. He’ll quickly follow up with a leaping dive attack to reach his mace, and then pull it out of the ground and swing it forth, which should quell any thoughts of trying to attack at this point.\n\nIdeally, the lower you have his health before killing his father, the less time you’ll have to worry about this phase if you can rush him down. If you don’t kill his dad, he’ll scurry off as soon as the Second Prince falls. If not, you’ll be able to help yourself to the Second Prince’s Spirit, as well as a Pungent Flesh Chunk.\n\n## Valley of Despair\n\nBefore you do that, instead take a left to where the sun shines down on a large rat statue and a curved wall, as well as a large pit. The pit holds one last major boss to deal with, which can arrive in a few ways.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - First Prince of Flowing Sands\n\nOther general attacks include alternating hand slams that come in 1 or 2 hit successions. He can also put his hand down to the side first, and then sweep it across the front in a slower swipe that you’ll need to dodge back from instead of moving alongside his hand.",
