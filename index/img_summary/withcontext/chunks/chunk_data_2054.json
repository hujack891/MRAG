    "img_above_text": "# New Thunderclap Temple Walkthrough\n\nThe New Thunderclap Temple is the final main region of Chapter 3 in The New West in Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n- Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\n\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\n\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n\n\nInside the side room, there's another large tree that a Supporter Monk is facing, but a Wolf Guardian will try to ambush you as you approach him. You can also find a Ginsengling around the tree roots by trying to harvest some Aged Ginseng.\n\nCarefully head through the open doorway into the side plaza, and look for a small alcove on the left for a green Wisp to absorb. However, once you begin to explore this area, a Yaoguai Chief will emerge from a nearby altar.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Monk from the Sea\n\nJust past him you can follow a small path to a pavilion, where you'll encounter a Wolf Guardian. Defeat him, and you'll earn a **Bronze Buddha Pendant Curio**.\n\nYou'll also find a small turtle chest on the pavilion's table itself, and opening it will reveal the **Sweet Ice** Soak for your Gourd Drink, giving you extra chill resistance after consuming your drink.\n\nBefore heading down the main stairs to a fearsome looking foe, head all the way around to the far stairs, which leads to another small building where two Thunder Rhino Masters overlook the enemy below. You'll want to take them out so they can't give him support.",

While he may look like a Yaoguai Chief, this is just a very formidable Yaoguai (that thankfully doesn't respawn).",
