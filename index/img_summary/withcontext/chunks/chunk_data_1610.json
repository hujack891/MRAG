One such secret area is in Chapter 1 and requires ringing three bells to access it. On this page, you'll find information on how to find each of the three bells and what awaits you in the hidden temple.\n\n\nIf you've been exploring every part of Chapter 1 thoroughly, you’ll likely encounter two of the bells before you’re even told about them. That being said, you might not have rung them. It’s not until the fight with the Whiteclad Noble that you’ll hear a riddle and then be prompted to find the three bells. If you're not sure where to find them all, here's where you need to look:\n\n\n\n## Bell 3\n\nThe final bell can be found in the Marsh of the White Mist. After the fight against the Whiteclad Noble, don’t go toward the building that leads to the Black Wind Cave.",
