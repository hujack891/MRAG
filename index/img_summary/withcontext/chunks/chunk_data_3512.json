    "img_above_text": "# Webbed Hollow - Upper Hollow Walkthrough\n\nThe Webbed Hollow is the second main area of Black Myth: Wukong's Chapter 4, starting with the upper portion of the large underground cave system. Below you'll find a guide for the first upper area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find your first encounter with the Venom Daoist, and the different ways to reach The Verdure Bridge.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Upper Hollow**\n* **Pool of Shattered Jade**\n- Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nBefore following the golden trail of a nearby Shrine, look to the left of the bed and small chest to find a path leading to another larger **Treasure Chest** you can open to claim a **Cuo Jin-Yin Belt Hook Curio** , another item that can help resist all the poison you'll be encountering.\n\n\nYou'll now find yourself on the opposite side of the Hollow from where you first started, with a group of platforms in front of you that offer a one-way ticket down to the start of the Middle Hollow and the Verdure Bridge. However, going down there now would cause to a miss a large optional area complete with a boss (but you can drop down early to grab the Shrine and warp back up if you want).\n\n\nCarefully carve a path through the Clawed Cocoons to reach the other side, and you'll find yourself in a large chamber with an even bigger cocoon hanging down from the middle. Something angry is muttering to itself inside, and its apparently waiting for you.\n\n## Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nLook out for an archer on the lower floor here, and get rid of him before crossing the bridge to find a ledge with another green Wisp.",

Just be warned that a Beetle Captain guards the Shrine along with an archer, and you may want to stun the captain or use Cloud Step so you can quickly eliminate the archer first.\n\nOnce you've activated the Verdure Bridge Shrine, it will be time to explore the even larger **Middle Hollow** portion of the Webbed Hollow Region.",
