    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text describes the progression of the walkthrough in the \"Foothills\" area, highlighting encounters with various soldier types and a Keeper's Shrine. Players are advised to clear enemies near the shrine, activate it, and check the Shrine Shop for items. The walkthrough then transitions to the \"Verdant Path,\" where players encounter a clearing adorned with chains and meet the Supreme Celestial Inspector, a significant character tied to earlier chapters.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a dramatic combat scene in a rocky, forested clearing. A heavily armored character is engaged in battle with a fiery, winged creature surrounded by glowing red embers and flames. The environment is detailed with chains hanging above, emphasizing the narrative's description of the clearing. The fiery effects and dynamic pose of the creature suggest an intense encounter, likely representing the Supreme Celestial Inspector's introduction and attack.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text elaborates on the Supreme Celestial Inspector's combat mechanics, introducing a fiery unicycle that enhances mobility and serves as an independent attack. The Inspector's heavy attacks are described as challenging to evade, adding complexity to the encounter."
