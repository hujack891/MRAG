    "img_above_text": "# The Stone Monkey\n\nThe Stone Monkey is one of the main and final bosses you'll fight Chapter 6 of Black Myth: Wukong. This multi-phase battle is a challenging fight that brings you toward the conclusion of the game.\n\n\nAfter another story from Zhu Bajie, the giant staff will shrink and you'll be able to get it from the body of water in front of you. Now that you've acquired the Jingubang and look exactly like Wukong, head to the back of the cave directly ahead.\n\nFollow the path to the peak, where you'll come to the Return Path Keeper's Shrine.\n\n\nWhen you emerge on the other side, you'll see the final stretch of the path that dips down and then slopes upward. Head for the top and activate the Peak of Innocence Keeper's Shrine, just before the end of the path.\n\n\nOn the other side, you'll find the Old Monkey. He'll tell you to step onto a boat, and then transport you across the water, while he recites the memories of Wukong.\n\n\nAs the cutscene sees you move toward the Stone Monkey, you'll be automatically thrown into a fight against it.\n\nNote! You won't be able to activate the Heart of Birthstone Keeper's Shrine here unless you die, but if you do, you won't need to go back to a previous shrine – you'll automatically be transported back here.\n\n## Stone Monkey Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThis fight has two phases, so be prepared for a tough battle and think about how you manage your Gourd and Spell usage throughout. You'll want to take in medicines that include Body-Warming and Body-Cooling Powder, as well as those that strengthen your attacks such as Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets and Loong Aura Amplification Pellets. You might prefer other medicines depending on the build you're playing with, such as the Mirage or Life-Saving Pill.\n\nThe first thing to note is that the Stone Monkey, like other Stone enemies, is resistant to elemental attacks, so the best thing you can do here is have a build that focuses on high attack strength and increasing the chances of critical attacks. His resistance to these attacks should also influence the Transformation you take into the fight with you – we'd recommend Ebon Flow or Azure Dust, which can both deliver heavy blows.\n\n\nHe'll freeze at this moment, and it can seem like a time to strike, but he's actually preparing to grab you. If he's able to, a small cutscene plays where you're thrown and slammed on the ground either side of him. The second attack is when he goes berserk and starts slamming his fists down on the ground around him more violently and quicker than his usual attack.\n\nYour aim during this portion of the fight should be to dodge attacks while building focus, and max out the four Focus Points as soon as possible. With Wukong's armor and staff, these won't deplete, so you can land impressive heavy attacks with the staff.\n\n### Stone Monkey Phase Two\n\nThe final part of this move is typically an even larger orb of fire will be thrown your way. This will mean that you can't spend all your time as close to them as possible, and will need to dip back at times to easily avoid these attacks.\n\nAt this stage, it's worth throwing out your spells like Pluck of Many to overwhelm the two enemies and using Immobilize to keep one in place, while you target the other.",
