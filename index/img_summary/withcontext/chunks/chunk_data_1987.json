They aren't as common as Blood of the Iron Bull's but these enemies do possess them occasionally. These enemies will also drop their Spirit for you to claim, so be sure to seek them out in our Spirit Locations guide.\n\n### Mind Core Location 2\n\nThe first Mind Core can be found upon defeating Lingxuzi in the Forest of Wolves \\- Outside The Forest Shrine area in Black Wind Mountain. This is a main boss, so you can't miss it.",
