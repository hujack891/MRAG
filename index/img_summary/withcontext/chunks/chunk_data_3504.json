    "img_above_text": "# Webbed Hollow - Upper Hollow Walkthrough\n\nThe Webbed Hollow is the second main area of Black Myth: Wukong's Chapter 4, starting with the upper portion of the large underground cave system. Below you'll find a guide for the first upper area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find your first encounter with the Venom Daoist, and the different ways to reach The Verdure Bridge.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Upper Hollow**\n* **Pool of Shattered Jade**\n- Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nBefore following the golden trail of a nearby Shrine, look to the left of the bed and small chest to find a path leading to another larger **Treasure Chest** you can open to claim a **Cuo Jin-Yin Belt Hook Curio** , another item that can help resist all the poison you'll be encountering.\n\n\nYou'll now find yourself on the opposite side of the Hollow from where you first started, with a group of platforms in front of you that offer a one-way ticket down to the start of the Middle Hollow and the Verdure Bridge. However, going down there now would cause to a miss a large optional area complete with a boss (but you can drop down early to grab the Shrine and warp back up if you want).\n\n\nCarefully carve a path through the Clawed Cocoons to reach the other side, and you'll find yourself in a large chamber with an even bigger cocoon hanging down from the middle. Something angry is muttering to itself inside, and its apparently waiting for you.\n\n## Boss Fight - Venom Daoist\n\nWith a quick dodge to the side and behind him, you can avoid his first two attacks, and then sidestep his leap and begin your counterattack -- as it takes him several moments to rise up a second time.",
    "img_below_text": "If you see him hold his sword to the side but one sword high up behind his back, it means he's going to charge at you at a very fast speed. Dodge to the side, but then be ready for a second dash to come soon after requiring you to dodge once more. Try dodging alongside his second dash or lure him into a corner, and you'll find time to hit him while he resets himself.",
