    "img_above_text": "# Chapter 3 Secret - Mount Mei Walkthrough\n\nMount Mei is the secret area in Chapter 3 - White Snow, Ice Cold of Black Myth: Wukong. However, you'll only be able to access it in Chapter 5 after completing all the secret areas in the game. We'd recommend waiting until you've finished Chapter 6 of the game and beat it before you visit Mount Mei, due to it being a vital place to see for the secret ending of the game.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **How to Unlock Mount Mei**\n* **How to Enter Mount Mei from The Great Pagoda**\n* **Mount Mei**\n- Erlang, The Sacred Divinity\n- The Four Heavenly Kings\n- Erlang Shen\n\n\nThere are several steps you need to take to unlock Mount Mei. You can find a detailed breakdown on our dedicated page: How to Unlock the Secret Ending (True Ending). But here's a quick rundown of everything you'll need to do by Chapter 6 to reach it.\n\n1. Complete the Chapter 1 secret area of the Ancient Guanyin Temple\n2. Complete the Chapter 2 secret area of the Kingdom of Sahali\n3. Complete the Green-Capped Martialist/Treasure Hunter quest in Chapter 3\n4. Complete the Chapter 4 secret area of the Purple Cloud Mountain\n5. Complete the Chapter 5 secret area of Bishui Cave\n6. Return to **The Great Pagoda in Chapter 3**. You can find it on the Snow-Veiled Trail in the Pagoda Realm.\n\n\nWhen you’re in The Great Pagoda, you’ll see tapestries around the room. One tapestry, at the very top of the room, will be red. Head for this, and a cutscene will begin where the small Buddha from Chapter 3 will be waiting for you. He'll open the tapestry and let you into Mount Mei.\n\n\nWhen you're through the tapestry, head up the stairs and follow the path. About halfway up you'll need to shimmy across a ledge on the left to reach the other side, then you'll continue up to the Mei-Jian Peak Keeper's Shrine.\n\n## Mei-Jian Peak\n\nHere is where you'll need to get your gear together before you go up to the tip of the mountain, where you'll be entering a boss battle against a familiar face.\n\n\nAfter crash landing back on Mount Mei, two giants will emerge. This is the Destined One's Stone Monkey form and Erlang Shen. When Erlang is thrown off into the distance, you'll be thrown into a fight against the Four Heavenly Kings.\n\n\nAbout halfway through the fight, you'll also be able to start using Ice Bath. When you use the Ice Bath Spell, the Stone Monkey's arms will be covered in frost, and when you punch, you'll inflict frost damage.\n\nWhen the Four Heavenly Kings have been taken down, there's just one more giant to deal with, which is Erlang Shen.\n\n### Erlang Shen\n\nJust keep pummelling away at Erlang Shen and making use of all the Spells until he's defeated.",
    "img_below_text": "At the end of the fight, a cutscene will begin and Erlang and the Destined One will return to their previous forms. You'll hear a barrage of voices while the wind spins around you, and you'll be transported out of Mount Mei.\n\nA cutscene shows the Old Man and the small Buddha talking outside of the tapestries, and you'll return to The Great Pagoda. Finishing this secret area in Chapter 3 will earn you the Azure Dome Transformation, where you can transform into the Stone Monkey.\n\nNow that you've defeated Erlang and the Four Heavenly Kings, you'll be able to see the secret ending of the game. To see the secret (true) ending, complete Chapter 6 as normal and defeat the final bosses to watch it play out.",
