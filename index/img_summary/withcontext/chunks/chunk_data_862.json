    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces the Daoist Mi, an optional boss in *Black Myth: Wukong*. He is located in a secret area of Purple Cloud Mountain during Chapter 4. Players must complete a quest before battling him, and defeating him yields rewards such as a spell, crafting material, and experience points. The journey begins at the Petalfall Hamlet Shrine, leading to a village overrun by hostile Daoists.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a player character approaching a small, rustic building in an overgrown area, likely part of the village mentioned in the preceding text. A Daoist NPC stands outside the building, suggesting potential interaction or quest progression. A glowing object inside the building, highlighted with a red circle, may indicate an important item or quest objective. The caption, \"It's been long since any soul has trodden these hidden bounds,\" adds a sense of mystery and isolation to the setting.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text describes an encounter with a unique Sword Daoist playing a flute, who is non-hostile and requests the playerâ€™s help. He explains that other Daoists have consumed Amourworm eggs, transforming them into undying husks. The player is tasked with finding and returning an Amourworm egg to him."
