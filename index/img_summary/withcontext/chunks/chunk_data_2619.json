Because of this, it’s recommended that you save challenging this foe until you’re almost complete with Chapter 2 and have a good set of gear and medicines at your disposal to increase damage negation. He’s worth defeating before you fight the final boss of this chapter, as you’ll be able to craft a new weapon upon his defeat.\n\n### Secret - Defeat the Stone Vanguard with the Shigandang\n\nAnother deadly attack he can perform will have the Shigandang stand up on two legs and alternate two delayed punches into the ground in front of him. After this, he’ll slam both hands deep into the earth, and after a pause will rip them out, creating a line of exploding pillars in front of him you’ll want to steer clear of and attack his sides or back.",

You’ll also gain the Skandha of Feeling, which is the second mysterious Skandha Key Item you can find in the game after the Skandha of Form early in Chapter 1.",
