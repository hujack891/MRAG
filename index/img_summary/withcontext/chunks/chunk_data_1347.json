A specific glowing wall near the first Flamling is highlighted, where players can harvest a Purple Lingzhi, which triggers a battle with a fungiman.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a dark, lava-lit environment with a prominent cart-like structure adorned with fiery, horned designs. A glowing red circle highlights a specific point of interest near the cart, possibly indicating an interactive or collectible element. The setting suggests a hostile area, with rugged terrain and glowing lava streams, aligning with the described dangers of Flamlings and other enemies.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text instructs players to continue exploring the lava stream, where they will encounter another Flamling and a tree that can be harvested for a Fire Date. Further exploration leads to a cart guarded by a Tenner and additional Flamlings, with a green Wisp collectible and a hidden chest nearby. Players are advised to approach cautiously to handle the enemies effectively."
