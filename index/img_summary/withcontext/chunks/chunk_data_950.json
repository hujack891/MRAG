    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe Emerald-Armed Mantis is a boss encountered in Chapter 6 of *Black Myth: Wukong*. Players must defeat other Yaoguai Chiefs, including the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer, before facing this boss. The battle takes place inside Zhu Bajie's stomach, near a golden tree surrounded by fog with green speckles. A cutscene initiates the fight.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the Emerald-Armed Mantis, a large, menacing creature with sharp, blade-like arms, standing in a dark, organic environment resembling the interior of a body. The mantis faces the player character, who wields a fiery weapon and is partially submerged in a pool of liquid. The scene emphasizes the intense and grotesque atmosphere of the boss fight.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe Emerald-Armed Mantis uses its blade-like arms to execute melee combos, starting with a downward stabbing motion that creates a brief vulnerability for counterattacks. It then transitions to slashing attacks, including spinning maneuvers that can deal significant damage."
