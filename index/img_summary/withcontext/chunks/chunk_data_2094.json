    "img_above_text": "# New Thunderclap Temple Walkthrough\n\nThe New Thunderclap Temple is the final main region of Chapter 3 in The New West in Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n- Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\n\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\n\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n\n\nInside the side room, there's another large tree that a Supporter Monk is facing, but a Wolf Guardian will try to ambush you as you approach him. You can also find a Ginsengling around the tree roots by trying to harvest some Aged Ginseng.\n\nCarefully head through the open doorway into the side plaza, and look for a small alcove on the left for a green Wisp to absorb. However, once you begin to explore this area, a Yaoguai Chief will emerge from a nearby altar.\n\n\nThe large gateway at the end of this path is guarded by three Overseeing Monks, one apart from the others, but all can be lured away independently due to their short-range senses.\n\n\nAfter defeating them, you can spot a lone monk standing inside. This is the target of the Snow Fox's quest for revenge, and you can now use the Snow Fox Brush in your inventory to transform into The Fox, and step inside to trigger a cutscene (if you enter first you can speak to him, but transforming near the monk will instantly trigger the fight without a scene).\n\n\nOnce you've claimed the pill, hop up the other side of the frozen river to fight the Clay Vajra. Follow the path around the frozen river past where several Censor Holders are praying before a Dual-Blade Monk, and you'll find a **Treasure Chest** in front of a large stone monument near where the frozen river leads to the bridge you ran across earlier.\n\nNow you can return back to the Main Plaza, and this time head up past where you defeated the other Clay Vajra for its Spirit, and enter the last part of the temple.\n\n## Temple Inner Courtyard\n\nThe opposite side of the Courtyard has an open door leading to the last of Yellowbrow's disciples.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-Pure\n\nWhen he decides to get nasty with his combos, you'll either want to learn the moves and deflect one to knock him off balance, or Immobilize to shut him down. One of his most lengthy combos will come when he sweeps his weapon upward and then back down for two rotations, and then quickly swings it back and forth three more times, before leaping up to perform one last spin attack as he lands. Without a lot of stamina in reserve, it will be tough one to evade completely.",
    "img_below_text": "This isn't all he's capable of, either. He can also run at you an let out a war cry as he swings his blade in a circle, and then chain it into a tornado of five spins, ending with a jumping slash attack that again is very hard to stay away from unless you can interrupt his attack with spells. Luckily, he'll end the attack with a long flourish, giving you time to get back at him.\n\nEven his single attack can deal big damage if you aren't ready for their relatively fast speed. He may feint his blade in an upward swing, before launching himself high into the air and crash down with an overhand swing.\n\nWatch his movements carefully to see if he goes back to his default positioning. If he comes out of the jump attack by pulling his blade around with him, he'll follow up with two spinning slashes that need to be avoided to deflected to stop him in his tracks.",
