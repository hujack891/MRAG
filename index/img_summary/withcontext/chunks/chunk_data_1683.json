    "img_above_text": "# How to Unlock the Zodiac Village and Upgrade Armor\n\nIf you're tired of hopping from shrine to shrine to see NPCs, or you're wondering how to upgrade armor in Black Myth: Wukong, then Zodiac Village is the place for you. This central hub for NPCs can be unlocked in Chapter 3 and will introduce a new smithing character to cater to all your armor and weapon needs, along with additional perks from those you've already met.\n\n* How to Unlock Zodiac Village\n* How to Upgrade Armor\n* Challenge Yin Tiger\n* Request Medicines from Xu Dog\n* How to Use Seeds and Harvest Ingredients\n\n\nNow you have the scroll, a number of NPCs you've already encountered in your journey will be reunited in the village. This will now act as a central hub where you can find Xu Dog, Shen Monkey, Chen Loong, and a new character - Yin Tiger.\n\n\nIt's with the Yin Tiger that this new ability to upgrade armor can be found. When you speak to him, three options will appear in his menu:\n\n* **Craft**\n* **Store**\n* **Challenge**\n\nCrafting with Yin Tiger not only offers the usual ability to craft Weapons and Armor but also has the Upgrade Armor option, meaning you**can finally improve your armor in Black Myth: Wukong!**\n\nDepending on when you reach the village, you might find there are brand-new Weapons and Armors to craft as well.\n\nUpgrading your armor will, of course, require materials, and you'll need the following depending on rarity:\n\nRarity        | Materials Required for Upgrade\n---|---\n**Uncommon**  |Will,  Silk\n**Rare**|Will, Silk, Cold Iron Leaves\n**Epic**|Will, Cold Iron Leaves, Fine Gold Thread\n**Legendary**|Will, Cold Iron Leaves, Fine Gold Thread\n\n\nAs mentioned, one of the options is to challenge Yin Tiger, which will end up in an intense fight between the two of you. It can be a tough battle, especially as he uses both wind and fire and performs a range of heavy attacks.\n\nWhen you manage to beat him, however, you'll be able to unlock a few rewards:\n\n* **You'll earn the Ebon Flow spell.** This will allow you to transform into the Yin Tiger, blocking attacks with the giant sword and getting close to foes by dashing forward.\n* **Return to speak to him and the Challenge option will become Equip More Curios.** This will give you an additional slot for another Curio to be loadout.\n* **You'll also unlock the following Legendary armor:**\n* Iron Horned Helmet\n* Iron-Tough Armor\n* Iron-Tough Gauntlets\n* Iron-Tough Greaves\n\n\nInteracting with Xu Dog in the Painted Realm now offers the option to Request Medicine. Each time you do this, Xu Dog will provide you with potions.\n\nYou'll need to wait a little while before new medicines are available, but you'll know when they are if the red dot next to Request Medicines appears.\n\n## How to Use Seeds and Harvest Ingredients",
    "img_below_text": "If you've acquired any seeds so far in your journey, you can give them to Chen Loong. He sits behind the Shen Monkey and Xu Dog, up the stairs. Just before the stairs, you can find baskets where you can harvest ingredients, or you can speak to him and the option to harvest the ingredients will appear.\n\n### Happy Harvest!\n\nThe first time you harvest ingredients, you'll earn the Happy Harvest trophy!",
