He is required to defeat to unlock a secret boss using an item he drops.\n\n* Rewards: Tiger's Acolyte Spirit, Old-Rattle Drum, Silk x2, Yarn x2, 758 Experience, 779 Will\n\n## Where to Find the Tiger's Acolyte\n\nTravel through the Windrest Hamlet area across a second bridge past the Windrest Bridge Shrine, and you can locate this boss in the middle of the final bridge leading back toward the Fright Cliff.\n\n### Tiger’s Acolyte Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nOn rare occasions, he may even go for a varied combo of his own using all the weapons at his disposal. Starting with a forward kick, he’ll launch into three spinning slash attacks with a reverse grip, followed by a quick claw swipe and upward sword swing all in quick succession. When he stops to raise his sword up, that’s your moment to stagger him with a heavy hit of your own to stop him in his tracks.",

Either the Red Tides or Azure Dust can work well in this fight, depending on if you want to match his agility in your wolf form, or tank his hits and then smash into him when he stops attacking. It’s also not a bad idea to try the Pluck of Many, as his smaller size makes him vulnerable to getting overwhelmed and staggered on all sides.\n\nWhen the Tiger’s Acolyte falls, he’ll drop a curious Key Item, the **Old-Rattle Drum** , as well as leaving behind the Tiger’s Acolyte Spirit to absorb. The child’s toy actually serves an important purpose to unlock another boss. You’ll need it to commune with a child’s spirit in various spots around the Yellow Wind Ridge.",
