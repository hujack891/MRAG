    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text introduces the Gold Armored Rhino, a Yaoguai Chief encountered in Chapter 6 of *Black Myth: Wukong*. It explains that the Rhino can be found at the Rhino Watch Slope, guided by the Feng-Tail General. Players are advised to activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine after completing a stamina and health test. The field where the Rhino resides is described as being littered with soldiers and fire, setting the stage for the boss fight.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts the Gold Armored Rhino in a dynamic boss fight scene. The Rhino, with glowing lightning effects around its horn, is positioned in a grassy and rocky battlefield. A player character, armed with a staff-like weapon, is shown engaging the Rhino. The environment includes scattered debris, fire, and rocky terrain, emphasizing the intensity of the encounter.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text provides tactical advice for the boss fight. It warns of the Rhino's lightning-based attacks and its charging moves, suggesting the use of rocks in the arena for temporary cover. Once the rocks are destroyed, players are advised to dodge its attacks. Close-range swiping moves with its horn are highlighted as opportunities to dodge and build focus, provided the player has unlocked relevant skills."
