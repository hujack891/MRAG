Secretly buried not far from another Yaoguai King, you'll need to seek out six Buddha Statue Eyeballs to unlock this boss.\n\n* **Rewards:** Heart of Stone, Skhanda of Feeling, Mind Core x1, Yaoguai Core x2, 1652 Experience, 1371 Will\n\n\n* Finally, when resting at the Rockrest Flat Shrine, you need only advance forward toward the entrance to the Stone Vanguard / Shigandang Boss Fights to find the final statue and Buddha's Eyeball.\n\n## Shigandang Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThough they appear in the same arena, the Shigandang is a much harder challenge compared to the Stone Vanguard. Because of this, it’s recommended that you save challenging this foe until you’re almost complete with Chapter 2 and have a good set of gear and medicines at your disposal to increase damage negation. He’s worth defeating before you fight the final boss of this chapter, as you’ll be able to craft a new weapon upon his defeat.\n\n### Secret - Defeat the Stone Vanguard with the Shigandang\n\nThe Shigandang will often start the fight by racing toward you on all fours, slamming the ground with each step that can make it hard to avoid if you don’t have a head start on sprinting back or using Cloud Step to give him the slip.",
    "img_below_text": "When the boss leaps into the air, he’ll slam down on all fours again to send out a tremor, but will also cause a stone pillar to shoot up by whichever part of his body you're closest to. The pillar will glow (as will his front arms), and after a moment explode and deal damage, so keep strafing away to attack a different part of his body.\n\nWhen attacking him from the front, be ready to deal with backhanded sweeps along the ground that you can parry with Rock Solid, or dodge and keep your combo going. However, if he stands up and pulls one arm back, you can expect a surprisingly far-reaching and fast lunging punch, followed by a slam into the ground.\n\nOther times, he’ll lift off the ground a bit to slam one fist down, and detonate both with a small area of effect blast. This is a perfect attack to try retreating using the Thrust Stance and hitting him from a distance with a charged heavy attack while out of range of the blast.",
