Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nThe easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step. Cast it near the start of the rope bridge, and then sprint all the way to the other end, and don't try to staff spin if any arrows come your way, or you're likely to walk off the side by accident.\n\n\nRather helpfully, there's a brazier by a ledge nearby, and looking down you can find a spot to drop back down to the two bridges we noted at the start of the Lower Hollow, putting you quickly back on track to the main pathway.\n\n\nBe sure to climb back up the ledges (use a jumping heavy attack to gain height), and continue to follow this path to a flooded cave where this chapter's Frog Boss awaits.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n\nThe fourth Frog Guai boss in as many chapters, Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw is a poison-infused boss, much the way the previous frog enemies have used lightning or ice in their respective arenas. However, you'll soon find that poison isn't the only new thing that this particular boss brings to the table. Still, having Antimiasma Pills can be essential to your survival, due to the ability for you to resist repeat poisoning when consuming them.",
