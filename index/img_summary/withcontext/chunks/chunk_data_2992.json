As an optional foe, you can seek out this boss in the Yellow Wind Formation high above on the Windrest Hamlet's bridge at the back of the region. He is required to defeat to unlock a secret boss using an item he drops.\n\n* Rewards: Tiger's Acolyte Spirit, Old-Rattle Drum, Silk x2, Yarn x2, 758 Experience, 779 Will\n\n## Where to Find the Tiger's Acolyte\n\nTravel through the Windrest Hamlet area across a second bridge past the Windrest Bridge Shrine, and you can locate this boss in the middle of the final bridge leading back toward the Fright Cliff.\n\n### Tiger’s Acolyte Mini-Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThe battle will often begin with him lowering his sword, only to leap forward at blinding speed to attack with both sword and claw at once, rolling past you as he does, and then performing a follow up slash as he finishes his roll. This means you’ll want to dodge past him as he approaches, so you can safely distance yourself from the following slash and then attack him back.",
    "img_below_text": "However, if he suddenly pivots after his slash to face away, be ready for him to perform a large overhand swing as he twists to face you. Though it's a vertical strike, it has a great deal of reach, sending a tremor along the ground from its force.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn’t even his only unpredictable leaping attack, as he can also just vault at you at top speed from a fair distance without a hint of preparation and cleave you with his sword for massive damage.\n\nOne leaping attack with a bit more warning will come when he jumps high into the air first, moving right above you before slamming down with his sword. The impact will be fierce, and even trying to use Rock Solid will simply send both of you stumbling back, so dodging is the better call here. It’s also a good idea to use Immobilize here, as there’s a good chance he’ll pull his sword out of the ground while performing a horizontal slash with incredible reach in a wide arc.",
