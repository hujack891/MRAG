A player character, wielding a staff, is engaged in a fight with a wolf-like enemy. Sparks fly as the enemy attacks, and a health bar above the enemy indicates its status. The text overlay, \"You'll know my strength soon enough!\" suggests the enemy is taunting the player. The scene emphasizes the dynamic and challenging combat mechanics of the game.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text advises players to ascend a nearby path with stone stairs, where they will face a new enemy, the Wolf Guardian. This enemy is described as highly mobile, using sickles to dart in and out of combat. However, with the player and their companion working together, the Wolf Guardian can be defeated efficiently."
