    "img_above_text": "# New Thunderclap Temple Walkthrough\n\nThe New Thunderclap Temple is the final main region of Chapter 3 in The New West in Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n- Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\n\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\n\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n\n\nInside the side room, there's another large tree that a Supporter Monk is facing, but a Wolf Guardian will try to ambush you as you approach him. You can also find a Ginsengling around the tree roots by trying to harvest some Aged Ginseng.\n\nCarefully head through the open doorway into the side plaza, and look for a small alcove on the left for a green Wisp to absorb. However, once you begin to explore this area, a Yaoguai Chief will emerge from a nearby altar.\n\n\nThe large gateway at the end of this path is guarded by three Overseeing Monks, one apart from the others, but all can be lured away independently due to their short-range senses.\n\n\nAfter defeating them, you can spot a lone monk standing inside. This is the target of the Snow Fox's quest for revenge, and you can now use the Snow Fox Brush in your inventory to transform into The Fox, and step inside to trigger a cutscene (if you enter first you can speak to him, but transforming near the monk will instantly trigger the fight without a scene).\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-Void\n\nInstead, watch his attacks carefully. His most basic attack will begin when he draws his arm in before lashing out with a straight jab with his long claws. Ignore the urge to retaliate, and instead wait a moment for him to follow-up with an incorporeal backhand followed by a blazing palm strike.\n\nYou'll have two options to counter this move: by dodging the third and final strike, you can use this time to capitalize on the end of his combo with Immobilize or Spirit Attacks to send him stumbling.",
    "img_below_text": "Once you've learned the timing of his combo, you can also perform a Rock Solid Deflection on his second strike even when he's incorporeal, and the deflection will knock him backward and out of his transparent form, allowing you to press your attack.",
