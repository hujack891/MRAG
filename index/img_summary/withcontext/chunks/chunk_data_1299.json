    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text describes the progression of the \"Fright Cliff Walkthrough,\" focusing on the Rock Clash Platform area. Players are advised on strategies for defeating the Stone Vanguard boss, including using the Azure Dust transformation to unleash powerful attacks. Additionally, it mentions a hidden secret boss, Shigandang, which can be unlocked by interacting with a carved stone after collecting six Buddha Eyeballs. The area also contains a chest with valuable items, including Blood of the Iron Bull and gold pieces.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a rugged, rocky environment with a humanoid character standing on a weathered stone platform. The character appears to be armed and dressed in battle-ready attire, suggesting they are exploring or engaging in combat within the Fright Cliff area. The surrounding terrain includes scattered debris, dried vegetation, and stone structures, consistent with the description of the Rock Clash Platform as part of the walkthrough.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text introduces the headless musician, who provides the player with a spell called \"The Pluck of Many,\" allowing them to summon copies of themselves for combat assistance. It also sets up the next phase of the walkthrough, directing players to fight another Vanguard boss at the Crouching Tiger Temple after resting at the Windseal Gate Shrine. This section emphasizes preparation for the next challenge while hinting at a return to the Yellow Wind Formation area later."
