His most common attacks are stomps and spin attacks, where he flings the top half of his body around in a circle. You can also expect to see belly flops and a loud roar attack that deals damage and sends you flying if you are too close. The Father of Stones has a long tongue that he can whip you with, almost like the frog bosses, although it's not quite as powerful as theirs.\n\nThe Father of Stones hits hard but is also rather slow. Stick to his back and press the dodge button to recover quickly when flung backward from his roar.\n\n## Father of Stones Spirit",

This is a great attack to pull out if you're getting overwhelmed by a lot of enemies and need some space to sip from your Gourd or take any Medicine. The equipped effect is also good, increasing both your Critical Hit Chance and Critical Damage. You can boost this even further in the Skill Tree.",
