Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nThe easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step. Cast it near the start of the rope bridge, and then sprint all the way to the other end, and don't try to staff spin if any arrows come your way, or you're likely to walk off the side by accident.\n\n## Relief of the Fallen Loong\n\nBack at the Shrine, head up the trail of old treasure chests to find another entrance back into the Webbed Hollow where a Scorpion Prince is guarding the cave opening.",
