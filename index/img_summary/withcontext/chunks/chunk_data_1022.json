Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Ashen Pass III**\n- Boss Fight - Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n* **Cooling Slope**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard\n- Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang\n- Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart\n* **Fallen Furnace Crater**\n- Yaoguai King - Red Boy\n- Yaoguai King - Yaksha King\n\nAfter defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the Yin-Yang Fish, and the Crimson-Silver Cart, you'll have climbed to the top of the Flaming Mountains and be closer to finding out where the Bull King is.\n\n\nThe gauntlet is almost over! As you continue on, there's a small gap on the left you can dart into and then it's onward toward the flames. When you approach, a cutscene will begin where you'll see the golden spiked ball go flying off the end of the cliff.\n\nAfter the cutscene, ignore Pingping running off, and turn back to where you came from. Remember the wall of flames? Head back there. Now that the ball is gone, it's safe to explore the area slowly and you'll find the flames have also disappeared. A path has been revealed, which is the Cooling Slope, and the next place we'll explore.\n\n## Cooling Slope\n\nAs you enter the Cooling Slope for the first time, there are two points of interest to take note of. Up ahead, there's a smattering of rocks. And to the left, there's a Luoija Fragrant Vine.\n\nIf you hug the rocks to the left, you can collect the Luoija Fragrant Vine safely, but be careful as a Searing-Fire will leap out at you as you get close to it.\n\nThen, you'll want to go over to that collection of rocks. When you approach, it will transform into your first miniboss of the region, which is the Flint Vanguard.\n\n\nTop Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top Spirit\n\n\nThis is actually where you can summon a miniboss called the Mother of Flamlings, and to do so, all you need to give over is 4x Flame Ores. Thankfully, Flame Ores are dropped by Flamlings, so you'll hopefully have enough by this point to summon her immediately. Approach the glowing patch and deliver the Flame Ores.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings\n\nAfter hitting her a few times, she'll be frustrated and scream. This is when the Flamlings will emerge and begin to shoot fireballs immediately. You'll want to clear these out as fast as you can and use your Fireproof Mantle and Body-Cooling Powder to counter any fire damage you might experience.\n\nWhen you've cleared out the first round of Flamlings, she'll reappear. This round of attacks will repeat until she's been defeated, except she can reappear when Flamlings are still in the arena after the first round. Still, the priority should be to remove them first before focusing on her.\n\nAfter the Mother of Flamlings fight, pick up the Mother of Flamlings Spirit and then continue on the path down the Cooling Slope.",

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text introduces the \"Cooling Slope\" area in the game *Black Myth: Wukong*. It describes the initial exploration of the area, highlighting two points of interest: a Luoija Fragrant Vine to the left and a collection of rocks ahead. The rocks transform into a miniboss called the Flint Vanguard. Additionally, it explains how to summon another miniboss, the \"Mother of Flamlings,\" by offering 4 Flame Ores.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a rocky, barren landscape within the \"Cooling Slope\" area of *Black Myth: Wukong*. A player character is seen approaching a path marked by a red arrow, which leads toward a glowing object and a small fiery enemy in the distance. The scene emphasizes exploration and the potential for encountering enemies or interactive elements.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text provides guidance for progressing further in the \"Cooling Slope\" area after defeating the \"Mother of Flamlings.\" It mentions a tree on the right where players can harvest a Fire Date, cautioning them about a Scorching-Fire enemy and a Flamling that will appear nearby."
