Whether you strike his stone form or not, he’ll use his own version of Cloud Step to race around the arena, and try to ambush you from a random angle. Watch for the signs of the blood splashing to anticipate where he’s coming from, and either let your stamina recharge to evade, or turn the tables on him with a Cloud Step of your own when he comes out of hiding.\n\nAfter the fight has raged for a bit and you may think you have a handle on this, you must still beware the Tiger Vanguard’s sword. He may deploy it sparingly, but when unsheathed it can deal a world of hurt and easily kill you before you’re able to find a time to heal. Knowing when that blade is coming is crucial to surviving the latter half of the fight.",
    "img_below_text": "The first instance is the easiest to spot, as he’ll assume a new stance putting two fingers in front of his face while his other hand rests on the handle of his sword. After a shout, he’ll unleash a single slashing attack that hits hard enough to launch its own projectile slash. Caught unaware, and it’ll easily take off more than half your health bar! It’s also the easiest one to punish, as he’ll usually take the time to put the blade back before starting his next attack, giving you a lot of time to strike back.",
