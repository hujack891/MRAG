Located in the Village of Lanxi, the Second Sister is a large spider that guards the entrance to the Webbed Hollow.\n\n* Rewards: Venomous Hair, Gold Tree Core, 2274 Experience, 1933 Will\n\n\nThe Second Sister is a required boss that you'll encounter very early in the start of Chapter 4. Once you arrive at the Village of Lanxi, you'll need to proceed through the town and across a narrow bridge to find a Shrine for the Zhu Estate.\n\nNearby, there's a door you can interact with, and your friend Zhu Bajie will disguise the two of you to gain access, and then encounter the Second Sister.\n\n## Second Sister Boss Fight and Guide\n\nTaking the form of a giant venomous spider, The Second Sister isn't the toughest boss you'll have faced thus far, but her many legs can sometimes make her movements and attacks hard to read. Luckily, with Zhu Bajie on your side, you'll be able to team up and keep her on the defensive. Make use of the Shrine's store to stock up on Antimiasma Powder.",
    "img_below_text": "Most of The Second Sister's main attack will come from her two front razor-sharp legs, and will be where you will want to focus the bulk (but not all) of your attention. She may often begin the fight by raising up one talon high up to the side, slice down with her two front legs in quick succession, and then rise up into the air to slam down after a delay.\n\nAnother move she can use at close range is to raise most of her body up on her back legs, and dance down upon you with her front talons to stab the ground multiple times in quick succession. Since it's hard to evade each blow individually, consider using the Thrust Stance to retreat and strike from a distance.",
