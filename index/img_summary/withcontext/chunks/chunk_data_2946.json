    "img_above_text": "# The Stone Monkey\n\nThe Stone Monkey is one of the main and final bosses you'll fight Chapter 6 of Black Myth: Wukong. This multi-phase battle is a challenging fight that brings you toward the conclusion of the game.\n\n\nAfter another story from Zhu Bajie, the giant staff will shrink and you'll be able to get it from the body of water in front of you. Now that you've acquired the Jingubang and look exactly like Wukong, head to the back of the cave directly ahead.\n\nFollow the path to the peak, where you'll come to the Return Path Keeper's Shrine.\n\n\nWhen you emerge on the other side, you'll see the final stretch of the path that dips down and then slopes upward. Head for the top and activate the Peak of Innocence Keeper's Shrine, just before the end of the path.\n\n\nOn the other side, you'll find the Old Monkey. He'll tell you to step onto a boat, and then transport you across the water, while he recites the memories of Wukong.\n\n\nAs the cutscene sees you move toward the Stone Monkey, you'll be automatically thrown into a fight against it.\n\nNote! You won't be able to activate the Heart of Birthstone Keeper's Shrine here unless you die, but if you do, you won't need to go back to a previous shrine – you'll automatically be transported back here.\n\n## Stone Monkey Boss Fight and Guide\n\nThis fight has two phases, so be prepared for a tough battle and think about how you manage your Gourd and Spell usage throughout. You'll want to take in medicines that include Body-Warming and Body-Cooling Powder, as well as those that strengthen your attacks such as Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets and Loong Aura Amplification Pellets. You might prefer other medicines depending on the build you're playing with, such as the Mirage or Life-Saving Pill.\n\nThe first thing to note is that the Stone Monkey, like other Stone enemies, is resistant to elemental attacks, so the best thing you can do here is have a build that focuses on high attack strength and increasing the chances of critical attacks. His resistance to these attacks should also influence the Transformation you take into the fight with you – we'd recommend Ebon Flow or Azure Dust, which can both deliver heavy blows.\n\n### The Stone Monkey Phase One\n\nDuring the first phase of the fight, the Stone Monkey will generally try to attack with a combo of punches. These can be avoided but it's best to use dodges to build up your focus quickly. Speed is key for this first phase, to keep as many of your medicines and Gourd uses available for the second phase.\n\nHe will also leap up and pound his fists down onto the ground, causing a shockwave of rocks immediately around him. As long as you dive out of the way when he goes to land or step back from him slightly, you can avoid this attack.",
