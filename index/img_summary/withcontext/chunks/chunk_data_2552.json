The Scorpion Prince is a big enemy, and it hits hard, too, so you definitely want to keep an eye on its tail during the fight.\n\nYou will most likely get poisoned during the battle, so you might want to take some Antimiasma Powder with you to cure you if your health gets dangerously low.\n\n## Scorpion Prince Spirit",
