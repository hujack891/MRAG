You’ll also meet the owner of the voice on the wind - the Keeper of Black Wind Mountain.\n\nThis friendly guy will be your guide and mentor for this part of the world, and will bid you to set out in search of Guanyin Temple, which burned down long ago but has since been rebuilt - but not by human hands. As the Keeper departs, he’ll bestow you with the Incense Trail Talisman, which can let you warp back to the last Shrine you rested at.\n\n## Front Hills\n\nHe’ll give a lot more experience and Will when defeated, and you can also loot a **Purple Lingzhi** on the left. On the right you can spot green wisps that denote wandering yaoguai spirits, but trying to gather them will only cause the wisps to fly off, giving you a fraction of their Will.\n\nHead back to the forest hill road, and this time make your way right to encounter your first mini-boss, a Yaoguai Chief.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Bullguard\n\nPast the wooden gate the Bullguard was blocking, you’ll find another forested area with a sloping path up to the left.
