The target of a Snow Fox's revenge and questline you can undertake, Non-Void hides within the New Thunderclap Temple.\n\n* **Rewards:** Non-Void Spirit, Blood of the Iron Bull, Cold Iron Leaves, Random Materials, 1847 Experience, 1195 Will\n\n## Where to Find Non-Void\n\nAt the entrance to this temple, you can now use the Snow Fox Brush in your inventory to transform into The Fox, and step inside to trigger a cutscene (if you enter first you can speak to him, but transforming near the monk will instantly trigger the fight without a scene).\n\n### Non-Void Miniboss Fight and Guide\n\nThe monk who killed the Fox Guai you encountered in the Forest of Felicity, Non-Void is one of the disciples of Yellowbrow, and has his own set of peculiar moves. While he doesn't deal elemental damage, he can be a hard target to pin down due to his ability to become non-corporeal, causing some of your attacks to pass right through him!\n\nThe key to defeating this foe is to learn his attacks, and more importantly learning which parts leave him vulnerable to counters, and when you won't able to hurt him. Whenever he becomes transparent, avoid using any moves like Immobilize as you'll just waste their cooldowns and mana.",
    "img_below_text": "Instead, watch his attacks carefully. His most basic attack will begin when he draws his arm in before lashing out with a straight jab with his long claws. Ignore the urge to retaliate, and instead wait a moment for him to follow-up with an incorporeal backhand followed by a blazing palm strike.\n\nYou'll have two options to counter this move: by dodging the third and final strike, you can use this time to capitalize on the end of his combo with Immobilize or Spirit Attacks to send him stumbling.",
