    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe preceding text describes the progression of the \"Fright Cliff Walkthrough,\" focusing on the Rock Clash Platform section. Players are guided through combat strategies, transformation mechanics, and interactions with the Man-in-Stone. The text transitions to a new area where players encounter floating stones signaling a boss fight and a hidden interaction with a carved rock that unlocks a secret boss battle. It introduces the Rock Clash Platform, detailing an altar with a Celestial Taiyi Pill and a sandy slope leading to a sub-region filled with Rat Archers.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a player sliding down a sandy slope, heading toward a new area. The environment is dusty and rocky, with visible structures in the background, including a pagoda-like building and enemies near the entrance. A red arrow highlights a specific path or point of interest, suggesting a direction for the player to follow or an area to explore.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text advises players to angle their movement to the left while sliding down the sandy slope to reach a large structure they can jump to. This provides an opportunity to explore further and potentially avoid Rat Archers in the area."
