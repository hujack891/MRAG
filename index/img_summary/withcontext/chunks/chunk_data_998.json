You'll see a Purple Lingzhi to harvest and another mushroom in the center of the clearing. When you pull this second one, you'll be confronted by the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai, which is an optional boss.\n\n### Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai\n\nThese tiny red mushrooms will appear in any area that his attack lands -- including on you. If they start to grow on you, they'll reduce your movement significantly. This doesn't affect dodging, however, just walking. The biggest problem with this is that as you move around, the red mushrooms will appear on the floor around you and continue to explode, so you'll need to keep moving.",

It provides a walkthrough for bosses, side quests, and items in various sections, including \"Ashen Pass III,\" where players encounter the optional boss, Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai. This boss is triggered after harvesting a mushroom in the clearing near the Keeper's Shrine.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts a battle scene between the player character and the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai, an optional boss in *Black Myth: Wukong*. The environment features a rocky terrain with volcanic elements, including lava flows and ruins. The boss wields a large mace, emitting red mist and debris, which aligns with its poisonous attack mechanics described in the walkthrough.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nThe following text elaborates on the boss's attack mechanics. The Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai creates poisonous red mist upon impact, which builds up poison on the player. Dodging is essential to avoid direct hits and the spreading fungi. Players are advised to equip Antimiasma Powder to counter poison buildup during the fight."
