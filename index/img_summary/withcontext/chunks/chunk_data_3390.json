    "img_above_text": "# Webbed Hollow - Lower Hollow Walkthrough\n\nThe Webbed Hollow is the second main area of Black Myth: Wukong's Chapter 4, concluding with the lower portion of the large underground cave system. Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider.\n\n* **Jump to a Section**\n* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**\n* **Lower Hollow**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw\n* **Hut of Immortality**\n- Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie\n* **The Purifying Spring**\n* **The Gathering Cave**\n- Yaoguai Queen - Violet Spider\n\nDue to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow.\n\n\nThe easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step. Cast it near the start of the rope bridge, and then sprint all the way to the other end, and don't try to staff spin if any arrows come your way, or you're likely to walk off the side by accident.\n\n\nRather helpfully, there's a brazier by a ledge nearby, and looking down you can find a spot to drop back down to the two bridges we noted at the start of the Lower Hollow, putting you quickly back on track to the main pathway.\n\n\nBe sure to climb back up the ledges (use a jumping heavy attack to gain height), and continue to follow this path to a flooded cave where this chapter's Frog Boss awaits.\n\n\nPast this foe, you'll enter another long dark tunnel, and you can find a Puppet Spider hanging up on the right above a green Wisp to absorb, and a patrolling Lantern Holder further down the tunnel.\n\n\nOnce you're ready, head through the gate to join the party, and it seems your just in time to meet the not-so-lucky groom.\n\n\nThere actually isn't anything more you can do in the Hut of Immortality, as all the doors are sealed. However, when you return to the Shrine outside, you'll find a new cave path has been carved out that leads outside to a large muddy hole.\n\nYour battle with Zhu Bajie isn't over. In fact -- it's about to get a whole lot harder.\n\n\nOnce you manage to burn down the rest of his health, you'll finally be able to free Zhu Bajie from the bewitching effect of the needle that was stabbed into his head, thanks to the mirror you found on the Right Hand of Buddha.\n\nUnfortunately, the spiders aren't done with him, and he'll be whisked away, leaving you with his **Blood-Stained Needle** and the **Jade Moon Rabbit Curio**.\n\n\nMoving along the main path, you'll find it guarded by one last Scorpion Prince, so be ready for his charging attacks and quick leaping tail strikes as you bait out opening to counter him. There's a few extra Skeletal Snakes in the vicinity, so beware they don't try and all gang up on you at once!\n\n\nHere you'll find one last Shrine for the Webbed Hollow, meaning the final boss of this particular area is fast approaching. As with other bosses in this realm, poison can be a big factor in the fight, so it's worth crafting extra Antimiasma Pills, and equipping poison resistant gear, curios, and Gourd soaks to help out where possible.\n\nWhen you're ready to face the mother of spiders, head through into the large cave opening to face the Lady of the Webbed Hollow. You'll learn more about her tragic life during the adventures of Wukong as she speaks with Zhu Bajie, and once you interrupt the scene, you'll need to prepare for battle.\n\n## Yaoguai Queen Boss Fight - Violet Spider\n\nThe same goes for their shared moveset of leaping forward to stab straight ahead with two talons, as she'll quickly follow the stab with a concentrated poison spray right in front of her, which you can avoid by dodging to the sides rather than rolling forward or backward.",
    "img_below_text": "When she goes into a frenzy of stamping down all of her legs quickly, she'll do so while spewing out poison in several directions. Try to stay one step ahead of her by keeping to her right side, and watch for her final talon stab at her front to your right, sending out another plume of poison, but leaving the rest of that area exposed to a counter attack.\n\nShe also has a nasty habit of rapidly twitching her body while standing still, only to suddenly pivot and slam her rear into you at full force, which can deal a ton of damage. Even if you're at range, expect webbing strands to fly out that you need to dodge or deflect with your staff spin.",
