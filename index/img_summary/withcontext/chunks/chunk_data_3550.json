    "img_above_text": "# Woods of Ember Walkthrough\n\nChapter 5 of Black Myth: Wukong begins in the Woods of Ember, with The Destined One and Zhu Bajie jumping straight into a fight. Below, you'll find a Walkthrough for the first major area of The Flaming Mountains called Woods of Ember, as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* ** **Ashen Pass I\n- Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Brown-Iron Cart\n* **Camp of Seasons**\n* **Height of Ember**\n- Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones\n- Yoaguai Chief - Gray-Bronze Cart\n- Yoaguai Chief - Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind\n* **Ashen Pass II**\n\n##  Ashen Pass I\n\nBefore you go over to them, harvest the **Fire Bellflower** by the Buddha statue on the right. Then, go straight up and into the midst of the fighting, to find the Pale-Axe Stalwart taking on nearby Revenants. Alongside the fighting, the area is also being pelted with firebombs so having the Fireproof Mantle Vessel here can help you focus more on the fighting and less on the fire attacks.\n\n\nDash up the broken steps and run along the small path to get behind the cart. Drop down and you'll also be at the next Keeper's Shrine.\n\n### Yoaguai Chief - Brown-Iron Cart\n\nThe Brown-Iron Cart doesn't have much variation in attacks. If you approach it head-on, you'll want to use the Fireproof Mantle to help with its continuous fire attacks. But, you can also avoid these by sticking close to its arms. You'll just need to watch out for when it rears slightly up and slams its fists down. Thankfully, this attack can be dodged.\n\nIf you've taken the small path to get behind it as we suggested, and got to the Keeper's Shrine, you have the advantage. The cart can't turn around considering it's on such a small path, so you can ignore the fist-slamming attacks entirely and focus just on when it blows out fire all around it. Use the Fireproof Mantle and watch out for when it blows fire. As soon as it dies down, drop down and hit it relentlessly with combos. When it starts to get ready to unleash the fire, jump back up the little ledge to completely avoid it.\n\nWith the first of the five element carts down, go and activate the Camp of Seasons Keeper's Shrine. Rest here, then go back on yourself to see the Pale-Axe Stalwart again.",
    "img_below_text": "Instead of finding him wherever you left him kneeling, you'll now see him by the edge of the cliff. As you come back down the stairs to the area where you fought him, you'll see a small set opposite with two Buddha statues on either side. Go up these and to the left, to find him overlooking the mountain. Talk to him and exhaust any new dialogue.",
