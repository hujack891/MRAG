Several Croaky enemies hide within them, so use your lock-on to identify them so you aren’t ambushed. However, as you make your way through the marsh toward a large stone mural in the cliffs, an optional mini-boss will leap out to fight you.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang\n\nFrom the mini-boss lair, you can head past where the toad emerged from to the right to find a path with a green wisp Spirit you can absorb for a decent amount of Will.
