By doing so, you can unlock a secret area to explore.\n\n* Rewards: Gold Tree Core, 2274 Experience, 1927 Will\n\n\nThe Venom Daoist's boss fight is a two-part optional boss encounter that you'll first find exploring the massive Webbed Hollow Portion of Chapter 4. When in the Upper Hollow, look for a ledge to drop down leading to the Pool of Shattered Jade past several hanging cocoons. In a small tunnel past the Shrine, you'll encounter a large cocoon that holds the Venom Daoist.\n\nAfter defeating him a first time, proceed through to the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Once you reach a fork in the road where the left path leads to the Court of Illumination Shrine, look for a path leading right up a mountain trail. Once you reach the top of the stairs, you'll find an alcove to the left leading down a large slope to an arena where the rematch will occur.\n\n## Venom Daoist Boss Fight and Guide - First Encounter\n\nAttack his back when you can either by Immobilizing him or using Spirit Attacks for large area of effect hits, and you'll actually be able to start tearing apart his extra limbs, dealing massive damage in the process.\n\nWhen he starts to complain about this, be ready for more quick dashes as a retaliation strike. Still, he's not too great at adapting, since his attack with two jump slams will still cause him to expose his back when his swords are buried in the ground.",
    "img_below_text": "When he starts getting low on health, expect him to get more desperate, throwing more sword slices into his combos. If you see him roll over himself at a distance, he'll slide at you foot first, but then vanish for a moment to appear straightened up before lashing out at you with a leap. Don't bother avoiding the slide, and just prepare to deflect his leap when he reappears.",
