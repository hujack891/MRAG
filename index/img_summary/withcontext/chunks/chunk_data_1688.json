The leader of the Temple of Yellow Flowers and master of the Spider Guai, he is the final boss of the larger Webbed Hollow region.\n\n* Rewards: Golden Glowing Eye, Sky-Piercing Horn, Celestial Ribbon, Fine Gold Thread, Gold Tree Core, Kun Steel, Mind Core, 5329 Experience, 3693 Will\n\n\nThe Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master is a main Yaoguai King, and the final boss you'll encounter in Chapter 4. You'll find him by following the blood trail of the Crimson Spider through the Temple of Yellow Flowers.\n\nOnce you reach the Court of Illumination, you'll find a pathway to the right that leads to a large field where the final boss is located.\n\n## Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master Boss Fight and Guide\n\nWhen the battle begins, the Violet Spider's daughters will launch into battle and try to battle with the Hundred-Eyed Daoist. You should absolutely use this period to help them out whenever possible and get your own hits in until the spiders are all defeated, but don't worry too much if you end up dying your first attempt. Even though the Spider Sisters won't reappear for subsequent attempts, The boss health bar will be permanently lowered by 15%, which is a pretty big boon to work with.\n\nOddly enough, there's actually two small areas on either side of the arena you can't reach the first time due to the cutscene, but can explore before attacking him on subsequent attempts. To the right, you'll find some Daoists guarding a **Treasure Chest** with materials, and on the left you'll find a small pathway leading to the side of the arena with a green Wisp to absorb.",

He has a number of different sword sweep attacks he can do when you try a frontal assault, slicing downwards with a forward and backward slash, then spinning around quickly to perform a third hit.",
