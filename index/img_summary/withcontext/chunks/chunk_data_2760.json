As a hulking monster of rock, the Stone Vanguard employs lots of tremor attacks and huge shockwaves whenever it slams its giant front arms down — which is most of the time. Cloud Step can be very useful for getting out of the way of incoming leaps, and then blindsiding it from the side to stagger it off of its current attack.\n\n### Secret - Get Help from the Shigandang\n\nWhen the fight starts you’ll need to watch out for an incoming leaping strike with one of its front arms, which it will usually follow up by rearing up and then slamming down with both arms pulled out around its front.",

These types of attacks mean his arms will soon have a delayed detonation, and are designed to bait you into countering early and getting caught in the blast. Instead, hang back and use the Thrust Stance if possible to unleash a charged hit from a safe distance to the side, as the detonation will also trigger rocks to rip upwards in front of him.",
