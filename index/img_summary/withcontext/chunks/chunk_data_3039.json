It comes with slightly improved stats compared to the Willow Wood Staff you are given at the beginning of the game. This will likely be your weapon of choice for most of the early game before you switch out to one of the other Weapons in Chapter 2 and beyond.\n\nThe weapon has a 40 damage stat, with no bonus critical hit chance. One perk of it over other weapons, however, is its unique effect. With the Twin Serpents Staff equipped, your light attack damage combo finishers have increased damage (by a moderate amount). When you are fighting in water, this effect is enhanced even more, making it a great weapon for the first chapter.",
