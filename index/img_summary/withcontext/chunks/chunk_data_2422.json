From the Sandgate Village Keeper's Shrine, run over the bridge to find several enemies, a few of which are perched on top of an inaccessible roof. You cannot reach them at this point, so head right and work your way around Sandgate Village.\n\nYou will eventually find yourself in the Earth Wolf's arena. Take down the wolf and open the door to continue onward. As soon as you open the door, the Rat Archer and his minions will jump down and ambush you.",
