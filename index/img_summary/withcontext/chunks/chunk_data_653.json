The text also highlights his susceptibility to being staggered and briefly describes his tail-based attack patterns, which include spinning strikes and a delayed electric slash.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the boss fight with Chen Loong in *Black Myth Wukong*. The scene shows the player character facing off against Chen Loong, a dragon-like creature with glowing purple energy emanating from its body. The battle takes place in a snowy, rocky environment near shallow water. The user interface displays health bars, abilities, and other combat-related elements, while dialogue at the bottom of the screen warns about Chen Loongâ€™s unpredictable and dangerous nature.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text elaborates on Chen Loong's attack patterns, emphasizing his ability to vary combos to confuse players.
