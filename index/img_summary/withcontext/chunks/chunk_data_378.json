    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:  \nThe Buddha's Right Hand is a mandatory boss fight in Chapter 4 of *Black Myth Wukong*, located in The Webbed Hollow. This long, eerie hand blocks the player's progress to the Lower Hollow. Players must defeat it to obtain key rewards, including the Buddha's Right Hand (Key Item). The fight occurs near the Vedure Bridge Shrine and involves strategic dodging and attacking.\n\nImage Summary:  \nThe image depicts the aftermath of the Buddha's Right Hand boss fight. The massive, elongated hand, with its grotesque and segmented design, lies lifeless across a chasm, forming a bridge. The eerie and dark environment emphasizes the hand's unnatural appearance and its role as a passage for the player to progress.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:  \nAfter defeating the Buddha's Right Hand, it attempts to flee but is violently shot down, creating a bridge with its body. A mysterious ally briefly appears to encourage the player to continue. The Buddha's Right Hand Key Item obtained from this encounter will later combine with the Buddha's Left Hand to craft a unique item in Zodiac Village."
