You'll find him by following the blood trail of the Crimson Spider through the Temple of Yellow Flowers.\n\nOnce you reach the Court of Illumination, you'll find a pathway to the right that leads to a large field where the final boss is located.\n\n## Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master Boss Fight and Guide\n\nFinally, if he sheathes his sword entirely to concentrate on sending his electric talismans at you, prepare for a length barrage. As he performs a gesture with his hands low, he'll bring them up as he explodes with energy, and then send a salvo of electric talismans flying at you.\n\nIf caught off guard, it's very hard to escape them once you first get staggered, but if you see the attack coming, step back and refresh your stamina, and then start spinning your staff to deflect the barrage until he's done.",
    "img_below_text": "You'll need to learn this fight carefully, as things will only get harder in the final phase, and you'll need as much of your healing gourd as possible. The good news is that despite his tendency to burrow after you deflect him, many of his attacks - even his poison spewing and many of his point-blank electrical talisman attacks can all be deflected by Rock Solid to stagger him. If you follow up with a charged 4 Focus Point hit, he may even fall to the ground, giving you a huge window to take out his health -- but we recommend saving your Transformation for the last part.",
