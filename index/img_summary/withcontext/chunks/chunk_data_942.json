Located in a secret realm locked away in the past, you'll need to activate three bells in order to locate and defeat him.\n\n* **Rewards:** Fireproof Mantle, 2,000 Will\n\n\n* **Bamboo Grove** \\- Traveling through the very short region of the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll have to defeat a character boss, the Whiteclad Noble. Once he retreats, look for a path off to the left instead of heading straight into Black Wind Cave, and you’ll find a large plaza past the marsh where several Wolf Guai sit before a wolf that has been hung from a tree. Just beyond them is the final bell.\n\nNote - Before facing this boss, be sure to defeat the optional **Wandering Wight** that is found in the Forest of Wolves region of Black Wind Mountain if you haven’t faced him already. Not only does he share many attacks with this secret boss, but defeating this one will cause the Wandering Wight to disappear, and you will not be able to gain the Curio and Spirit that the Wight drops.\n\n## Elder Jinchi Fight and Guide\n\nThe Wandering Wight’s most annoying attack to deal with also returns, as Jinchi can raise his fist high and then slam it down, creating a single shockwave blast, or keeping his hand in the ground to erupt the ground at farther distances up to three times (which is a good time to run away and hit any wandering corpses). Seeing him raise up his hand for this attack is one of the best times to try **Immobilizing him** and dealing enough damage to stagger him out of the attack before he can truly start it.\n\nSimilarly, you can use the Wandering Wight’s Spirit Attack to quickly stagger Jinchi, which is great for breaking him out of otherwise dangerous moves - provided you do so before the attack lands since it can still hurt your health bar.",
    "img_below_text": "After losing a bit of his health, the Elder Jinchi will get mad, often proclaiming you’ve stolen some treasure from him, and command his followers to attack. Now, finally, the shambling bodies will finally become a threat, and begin to glow as they chase you.\n\nThe good news is they don’t move all that fast, and must stop for a moment before finally exploding. All you need to do is lead them on a merry chase, and zigzag around to cause them to begin to explode before dashing away. Once no more glowing zombies are near you, resume your fight against Jinchi.",

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text introduces Elder Jinchi as a secret optional boss in *Black Myth Wukong*, encountered in Chapter 1 after activating three bells. It describes Jinchi’s attacks, such as shockwave blasts, and suggests strategies like using immobilization or the Wandering Wight’s Spirit Attack to stagger him. Players are advised to defeat the Wandering Wight beforehand to gain rewards and prepare for Jinchi’s similar attack patterns.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts the intense battle against Elder Jinchi in a dark, decrepit courtyard setting. Jinchi is shown unleashing a glowing, explosive attack while surrounded by glowing zombie-like entities. The player character is visible in the foreground, seemingly dodging or recovering from an attack. The HUD displays health bars, abilities, and Jinchi’s name, emphasizing the boss fight's challenging nature.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text explains that Elder Jinchi summons glowing zombie-like followers after losing some health, accusing the player of theft. These zombies chase the player slowly and explode after pausing briefly. Players are advised to lead them in a zigzag pattern to trigger explosions safely before resuming the fight against Jinchi."
