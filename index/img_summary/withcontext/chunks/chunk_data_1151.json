You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire.

Once you're done with the final one, hop back onto the Somersault Cloud.\n\nFly up and face toward the water. You'll be heading right along the river, to reach the next main boss. But before you go there, there's another optional boss to take care of.\n\nYou can actually find multiple of the Water-Wood Beasts along the way, but there's only one where the health bar appears where you fight it, and it's much bigger than the others, which is why we've just included the one here.\n\n### Yaoguai Chief - Water-Wood Beast\n\nThis fight is where your transformations can really shine, particularly Red Tides. Because it's a wood beast, it's easy to set it on fire with Red Tides attacks. It's also useful to be able to use the heavy attack and dash forward to catch up with it. Once you've built enough focus, perform a heavy attack in Red Ties to knock it over and set it on fire.",
