Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n- Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n- Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n- Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\n\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\n\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up.\n\n\nInside the side room, there's another large tree that a Supporter Monk is facing, but a Wolf Guardian will try to ambush you as you approach him. You can also find a Ginsengling around the tree roots by trying to harvest some Aged Ginseng.\n\nCarefully head through the open doorway into the side plaza, and look for a small alcove on the left for a green Wisp to absorb. However, once you begin to explore this area, a Yaoguai Chief will emerge from a nearby altar.\n\n## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Monk from the Sea\n\nIn addition to his large snowy boulder throw for massive damage, he can also toss two smaller rocks when at a far distance, but they deal less damage and are easier to step away from.",
    "img_below_text": "What really makes this Yaoguai a Chief is his ability to invoke frost damage. Whenever you spot him rise up in the air on his two appendages and create a gust around him, he's actually coating the area in frost, which will quickly raise your frost meter while in the area.\n\nConsidering how snowy the area already is, this can be quite dangerous as it's hard to tell where the affected area is. Look carefully for a low mist, or try to reposition yourself in a non snow-covered area to see when its been painted over in white.",
