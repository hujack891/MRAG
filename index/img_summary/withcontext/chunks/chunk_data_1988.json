However during Chapter 2 in Yellow Wind Ridge you will be able to start using them, providing you complete a questline.\n\n\n## Black Myth: Wukong Mind Core Locations\n\nBelow, you can find a list of all the Mind Core locations in the game's first two chapters:\n\n\nWhen you stumble upon a blue, glowing enemy and defeat them, you have a chance to get a Mind Core. They aren't as common as Blood of the Iron Bull's but these enemies do possess them occasionally. These enemies will also drop their Spirit for you to claim, so be sure to seek them out in our Spirit Locations guide.\n\n\n### Mind Core Location 3\n\nThe next Mind Core is located in the Forest of Wolves \\- Outside The Forest area. Along the left side of the area, you can find a small path beneath a leaning branch. At the back of this path is a waterfall that you can enter.\n\nYou will need to obtain the Loong Scales from Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge before you are able to access the secret area behind it. This will require you to defeat the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince and First Prince of Flowing Sands. The video guide below will take you through how to obtain the Loong Scales.\n\nIn the secret area, you can fight Red Loong \\- one of the many optional bosses in the game. Defeating him will drop a Mind Core.",
