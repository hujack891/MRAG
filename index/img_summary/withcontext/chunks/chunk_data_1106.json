To combat Jiao-Loong of Waves, you'll want to use heavy attacks. It's not so steady on its feet, so you can easily knock it over or at least temporarily stun it. This will give you longer periods of time to give it a beatdown without interruption.

    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text describes a walkthrough for a game section titled \"Verdant Path\" within the \"Foothills Walkthrough\" document. It details a sequence of events where the player encounters and defeats the Supreme Celestial Inspector, leading to the acquisition of a new ability, Wukong's Somersault Cloud. The player is then directed to explore a new area, leading to a pool of water where they encounter the optional boss, Jiao-Loong of Waves.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image shows a large, serpent-like creature partially submerged in a body of water, likely representing the boss Jiao-Loong of Waves mentioned in the context. The creature's tail is visible above the water's surface, suggesting its presence and the impending battle described in the text.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text provides additional details on the battle with Jiao-Loong of Waves. It explains that once the boss's health is reduced to below half, it will dive into the water, becoming temporarily unreachable. The player must observe the ripples on the water's surface to anticipate where the creature will re-emerge and continue the fight."
