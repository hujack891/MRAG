With a loud gong, the trapped \"Admiral\" will use the cymbal to awaken a giant turtle whose mountainous shell you're actually standing on.\n\nAs the turtle begins to swim through the Bitter Seal, the woman will become aware of your presence, starting this new region off with a bang of a boss fight.\n\n\nAs long as your patient to wait for the right moments to get in close and attack, and make sure you're using shock-quelling medicine, you'll be able to come out on top.

He's a formidable blacksmith who you can interact with to finally upgrade your armor, allowing you to raise the armor ratings of sets you've found previously but became outdated. He also sells unlimited quantities of lower materials if you need to quickly craft or upgrade older gear.\nYou can even choose to challenge the Yin Tiger to a duel, but be warned, he is incredibly deadly, and likely way beyond your current level. However, if you manage to defeat him, expect to unlock a new Transformation Spell and blueprint for a new armor set!",
