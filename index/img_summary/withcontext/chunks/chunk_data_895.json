This character will ask you to complete a side quest for him that will unlock Chapter 2’s Secret Area: The Kingdom of Sahali.\n\n\nIn this large open field, you’ll find a friendly boar-like Guai resting on a rock. He’s apparently extremely inebriated, and needs you to help him find something to sober him up. He’ll mention “**Windrest** ” if you talk to him again, providing a clue to where you can find such an ingredient.\n\n\nOn the left side when looking at the large building, defeat a Blazebone monster, and then look to the right for a **small alcove** , where you can spot a **glowing pot**. Break the pot, and you’ll find the **Sobering Stone**.\n\n## At the Crouching Tiger Temple\n\nFast travel from a Shrine over to the **Crouching Tiger Temple Entrance** , and start to head up the stairs, and then **turn right before the top** — opposite where the Meditation Spot is. You’ll find the Boar **resting against a far wall** under one of the giant tiger sculptures.\n\nSpeak to him, and he’ll complain of the poor meat quality, and instead proclaim that he would rather eat a meatless meal. He’ll ask that you **bring him a Jade Lotus** , which you may already have gathered a lot of by this point.
