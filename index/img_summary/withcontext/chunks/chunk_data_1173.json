    "img_summary": "Preceding Text Summary:\nThe preceding text describes a walkthrough of the Foothills area, focusing on combat encounters, shrine activations, and item collection. Players are guided to defeat enemies, activate Keeper's Shrines, and explore locations like the Mount Huaguo Shrine Shop for items. The narrative also introduces the acquisition of the Skandha of Consciousness after defeating a boss and interacting with a monkey character.\n\nImage Summary:\nThe image depicts a scenic, mountainous landscape with dense vegetation, rocky cliffs, and a clearing below. A character, seemingly airborne on a cloud-like platform, is positioned in the foreground, overlooking the area. A red arrow points toward a cliffside path, suggesting a direction for progression or exploration. The image serves as a visual guide for navigating the area described in the walkthrough.\n\nFollowing Text Summary:\nThe following text continues the walkthrough, directing players to return to a previously mentioned location near the clearing with water and golden trees. Players are instructed to take a different path leading left instead of right, advancing toward new objectives and encounters."
