The Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang Spirit offers players abilities such as "Tongue Whip," which reduces the stamina cost for jumps and jump attacks. This spirit allows players to assume the form of a random frog and provides various elemental effects like lightning, mist, poison, flame, and stone.

To evolve Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang, players must engage in battles with frog bosses throughout the game, each providing a Tadpole upon defeat. These Tadpoles are essential for the spirit's evolution, distinguishing the process from other spirits that require Will and a Knot of Voidness for upgrades.
