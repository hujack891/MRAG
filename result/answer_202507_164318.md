The **Clay Vajra** is located in the game *Black Myth: Wukong* at the **New Thunderclap Temple**. Specifically, this large, four-legged creature can be found guarding the entrance to the temple. Players will encounter him in the snowy courtyard outside the steps leading to the main temple, which is situated near the back of the complex. To reach the Clay Vajra, players must fight their way through the temple grounds.

This formidable foe not only serves as a challenging boss but also offers rewards upon defeat. Players can absorb the Clay Vajra's Spirit, which provides temporary access to his powers, such as the "Flames of Doom" ability. This ability allows players to unleash a flaming knee attack that damages enemies in all directions. Additionally, equipping the Clay Vajra Spirit moderately increases Burn Resistance, making it particularly useful in fire-heavy areas like the Flaming Mountains.
