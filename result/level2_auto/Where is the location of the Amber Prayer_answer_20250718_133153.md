Q: Where is the location of the Amber Prayer?
A:
The Amber Prayer Beads, an epic item in *Black Myth: Wukong*, are a curio that moderately increases the speed at which players gain focus points. These beads are found in the "Height of Ember" area within the "Woods of Ember," specifically along the Gray-Bronze Cart boss path, inside a box.

To collect the Amber Prayer Beads, players must navigate through a dark cave filled with faint green Wisps and lava. Upon exiting the cave, they should head towards the stone statues outside to locate the box containing the Amber Prayer Beads.
