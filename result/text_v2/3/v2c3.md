Q: How to Find the Supreme Celestial Inspector?
A:
To find the Supreme Celestial Inspector in *Black Myth: Wukong*, you need to follow a specific path outlined in Chapter 6 of the game. This chapter begins with a linear path that guides you down a slope from your starting point. As you descend, you'll encounter the first Keeper's Shrine. From there, continue upwards into a clearing that is marked by large chains, a significant landmark in your journey to confront the Inspector.

In this clearing, you'll reach what appears to be a dead end, but this is where the Supreme Celestial Inspector will appear. If you collected all the Purple Talismans in Chapter 4, this boss will be familiar to you. The battle takes place in a setting surrounded by rocky terrain and chains, providing a dramatic backdrop for the encounter.

The Supreme Celestial Inspector is a winged boss that uses both thunder and fire attacks. Initially, it will primarily use thunder, so it's advisable to have Shock-Quelling Powder and gear that offers shock resistance. As the battle progresses, fire attacks will be introduced, requiring Body-Cooling Powder. The final phase of the fight combines both elements.

During the fight, the Inspector may fly up, becoming unreachable, and attack with projectiles. Use the Plantain Fan to bring it back down. Additionally, its wings can turn to solid gold, deflecting your attacks. It's best to wait for it to spread its wings again before attacking. Bajie, a companion, can assist by topping up your health, so conserve your resources while he's present.

This boss fight is a significant challenge in Chapter 6, requiring strategic use of items and awareness of the Inspector's attack patterns to succeed.
