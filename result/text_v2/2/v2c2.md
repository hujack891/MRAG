To quickly defeat Jiao-Loong of Waves in *Black Myth: Wukong*, you must adapt to its limited yet aggressive moveset and its water-phase behavior. Below is a detailed guide on the best strategies to handle this encounter, along with visual aids to enhance your understanding.

### Understanding Jiao-Loong's Attack Patterns
Jiao-Loong of Waves relies on quick moves, tail whips, lunges, and pounces to catch players off guard. It also has a stunning roar that can leave you vulnerable for a few seconds. Staying close to the boss while dodging or jumping back at the right moments is key to avoiding damage.

### Effective Strategies for the Fight
1. **Use Heavy Attacks**: Jiao-Loong is not very steady on its feet, making it susceptible to being knocked down. Heavy attacks can temporarily stun the boss, giving you ample time to deal significant damage.  
2. **Employ the Plantain Fan**: This weapon is especially effective in this fight, as it can repeatedly knock Jiao-Loong to the ground, extending your attack opportunities.

### Dealing with the Water-Phase Behavior
When Jiao-Loong's health drops below 50%, it will dive into the water, making it temporarily unreachable. During this phase:
- **Watch for Ripples**: The boss will move beneath the surface and emerge to attack. Look for ripples in the water to predict where it will surface.  
- **Avoid the Tail Attacks**: Jiao-Loong's tail will appear from the water, striking multiple times in a tentacle-like manner. Be prepared to dodge these attacks, as they can overlap and require quick reflexes.

### Final Tips
- **Be Aggressive with Spells**: Since Jiao-Loong has a straightforward attack pattern, you don't need to conserve your spells. Use them liberally to deal high damage and end the fight quickly.  
- **Stay Alert**: Its roar and sudden lunges can catch you off guard, so maintain focus and keep your distance when necessary.
