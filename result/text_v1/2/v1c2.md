Q: What is the best strategy to quickly defeat Jiao-Loong of Waves, and how does its water-phase behavior affect the fight?
A:
To quickly defeat Jiao-Loong of Waves, understanding its attack patterns and behavior in its water-phase is crucial. Jiao-Loong is known for its quick moves and tail whips, which it uses to catch players off guard. It has a limited moveset, making it easier to predict and counter its attacks. The strategy involves staying close to the boss while being cautious of its stunning roar. Using heavy attacks is effective, as Jiao-Loong is not very stable and can be knocked over or stunned, allowing for uninterrupted periods of attack. Utilizing the Plantain Fan can further incapacitate Jiao-Loong, providing more opportunities for damage.

During the fight, Jiao-Loong exhibits aggressive behaviors such as lunging and swiping, and occasionally sidesteps or leaps to bite. Dodging or jumping back effectively avoids these attacks. However, once its health is reduced past halfway, Jiao-Loong enters its water-phase, diving underwater where it cannot be reached. It will attempt surprise attacks by emerging from the water at unpredictable locations, indicated by ripples. The key to surviving this phase is to watch for these ripples and anticipate its emergence, allowing for timely dodges.

Jiao-Loong's water-phase involves diving in and out of the water multiple times, with its tail appearing tentacle-like to strike. This phase requires careful dodging as multiple tail strikes can overlap. Despite the challenge, the limited range of attacks and straightforward evasion strategies make Jiao-Loong manageable. Players are advised not to conserve spells, using them liberally to expedite the defeat of this miniboss.

Overall, Jiao-Loong of Waves is a formidable opponent due to its swift and agile nature, but with the right strategy focusing on heavy attacks, dodging, and spell usage, it can be defeated efficiently. Understanding its behavior in both normal and water-phase is key to overcoming this challenge in *Black Myth: Wukong*.
