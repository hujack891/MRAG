Q: Where is Clay Vajra located?
A:
The Clay Vajra is located in the **New Thunderclap Temple** in the game *Black Myth: Wukong*. Specifically, you can find this formidable foe guarding the courtyard outside the steps leading to the main temple. The main temple is situated near the back of the complex, meaning players must navigate through the temple grounds from the entrance to confront the Clay Vajra.

This large, four-legged creature serves as a challenging adversary, and defeating it allows players to absorb its Spirit, granting temporary access to some of its powers, such as the "Flames of Doom" ability. This ability is particularly useful in fire-intensive areas of the game.
