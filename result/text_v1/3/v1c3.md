#### 3. Encounter the Supreme Celestial Inspector
As you enter the center of the clearing, Bajie will exclaim that it seems to be a dead end. However, this is where the Supreme Celestial Inspector will appear to challenge you. If you collected all the Purple Talismans in Chapter 4, this boss may be familiar to you.

### Tips for the Battle Against the Supreme Celestial Inspector

#### 1. Be Prepared for Elemental Attacks
The Supreme Celestial Inspector uses both thunder and fire attacks:
- **Thunder Attacks**: These dominate the first third of the fight. Bring **Shock-Quelling Powder** and equip gear that boosts resistance to shock.
- **Fire Attacks**: These appear in the second phase. Prepare **Body-Cooling Powder** to counteract the fire damage.
- **Combination Phase**: In the final part of the fight, the boss will use both elements, so stay vigilant and manage your resources carefully.

#### 2. Manage Its Aerial Attacks
The Supreme Celestial Inspector will frequently take to the air, launching projectile attacks. Use the **Plantain Fan** to bring it down and make it vulnerable to your attacks.

#### 3. Watch for Its Defensive Mechanisms
The boss can turn its wings to solid gold, deflecting most of your attacks. While damage is still possible, it's minimal. Wait for the wings to spread again for a better opportunity to strike. During this phase, Bajie will assist you, so try to conserve your healing items as Bajie can replenish your health.

#### 4. Additional Combat Notes
The Supreme Celestial Inspector also wields a sword that emits red energy, which is the source of its thunder-based attacks. Stay mobile to avoid these powerful strikes.
