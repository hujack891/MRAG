Q: How can i go to the Back Hills?
A:
To reach the Back Hills in the game "Black Myth: Wukong," you need to start by heading down the stairway from the back of the temple. This will lead you into a new valley where you will encounter a few Wolf enemies. The setting is atmospheric, with dense foliage and a path that guides you forward. As you descend, be prepared to face challenges and navigate through the lush, forested environment.

As you progress, you'll come across the base of some small falls where Croaky frog Guai are waiting among Jade Lotus plants. This area is rich with items to collect, such as a green wisp and Will. Another wisp can be found by heading up the stone stairs on the side and looking left into a small canyon. Make sure to explore thoroughly to gather all the available resources.

Continue along the main path, and look for a broken fencing path past some plants on the right. Here, you'll encounter a new enemy type, the Wolf Sentinel, who wields a small halberd. Dodge their attacks and retaliate with charged attacks to defeat them. Afterward, you can loot a large wooden chest they were guarding. Keep an eye out for a large slab with a mural, and to its right, a small alcove where you can harvest a Snake-Head Mushroom.
