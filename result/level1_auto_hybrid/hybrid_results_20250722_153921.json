        "h2_content": "When you hit level 20 and beyond, you'll start to unlock even more of the Skills Trees. By the end of Chapter 2/start of Chapter 3, you can have all of the Skills tabs unlocked (as long as you've explored thoroughly and taken down optional bosses). This will grant you the Alteration, Strand, and Transformations skills.\nAlteration applies to spells like Cloud Step and Rock Solid and will improve the health of your decoy, movement speed, and unlock the chance to deflect attacks with a parry.\nThe Transformations menu applies to any Transformation spells you collect and you'll find skills to improve might recovery, maximum health when transformed, increased defense, and more.\nFinally, in the Strand menu, you'll find the spell A Pluck of Many, where you can send out multiple Duplicates to help you. The skills you can unlock here will increase the health of your Duplicates, along with their attack power, and more.\n### Best Foundation Skills to Unlock\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Simian Agility**|  Moderately reduces stamina cost of Dodging\n**Robust Constitution**|  Each talent level moderately increases Maximum Health\n**Rampant Vigor**|  Increase maximum stamina\n**Effortless Finisher**|  More Focus when the Second move on Light Attack combo hits an enemy\n**Punishing Downpour**|  Light Attack Finisher deals extra Damage after six successful hits\n**Composure**|  Dodging doesn't interrupt Light Attack Combo\nFoundation Skills are full of useful abilities and we'd recommend focusing your Sparks in this category, especially at the start of the game.\nRobust Constitution and Rampant Vigor will give you boosts to your health and stamina respectively, helping you in those early fights. Similan Agility works well with Rampant Vigor, reducing the stamina cost of dodging, while you're already benefiting from an increase to max stamina. Being able to dodge consistently and worry less about stamina will get you out of some sticky situations.\nAlong with the suggested skills, we'd suggest unlocking skills that will allow you to complete combos without interruption, with more attack power on finishers, and those that build focus quickly.\n### Best Staff Stances Skills to Unlock\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Resolute Counterflow**|  Perform a Heavy Attack during a Light Attack combo to consume Focus Point and perform Resolute Strike.\n**Skyfall Strike**|  After Resolute Strike, perform another Heavy Attack consuming a Focus Point\n**Invigoration**|  Grants massive Focus when performing Resolute Strike\n**Exhilaration**|  Increases the Health recovery when consuming a Focus Point based on talent level\n**Versatility**|  Increases damage of Varied Combos\nThe skills you choose in this category will depend on your stance preference but we'd argue that Smash Stance is the best. With the suggested skills, you'll unlock a new Heavy Attack at the end of a Light Attack combo. Adding Invigoration to the chain of Resolute Counterflow and Skyfall Strike will ensure you're building plenty of focus while completing those combos.\nThe aim for the Staff Stances category is to get 20 points in there at least to eventually unlock Focus Attack IV and have 4 Focus Points you can build up at a time.\n### Best Mysticism Skills to Unlock\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Stagnation**|  Extends duration of Immobilization on next attack (Stacks up to 5-10 times)\n**Evanescence**|  When enemies attack after being Immobilized, the duration increases along with the damage they take\n**Raging Flames**|  Focus generates each second you're within the Ring of Fire\n**Consolidation**|  Slowly recover health while in the Ring of Fire.\nYou'll unlock Mysticism early on and be able to use Immobilize to stop enemies in their tracks. Skills like Stagnation, where you extend the duration of Immobilization the next time you use the spell are invaluable especially as they stack.\nTeam this with Evanescence and you can extend the Immobilization once again, but also increase the damage they take once they try to attack. The goal for this category should be to try and do as much damage as possible and have the spell last as long as you can.\nLater on, you'll also earn Ring of Fire, which will help you recover quicker and can be used to protect against the cold. Skills like Raging Flames and Consolidation are worth unlocking here, to help you recover and build Focus simultaneously so you can jump back into the action as you exit the ring.\n### Best Alteration Skills to Unlock\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Concealed Observation**|  Critical Hit Chance after Unveiling Strike is increased by talent level (can stack up to 10 times)\n**Thunder Strike**|  When in Cloud Step, Unveiling Strike can be a charged Heavy Attack\n**Rock Mastery**|  Reduces the cooldown of the spell\n**Ironclad**|  Damage Reduction given after a Deflection\n**Bold Venture**|  Recover Mana when successfully Deflecting |\nAlteration consists of spells like Cloud Step and Rock Solid. For Cloud Step, we'd suggest focusing on skills such as Concealed Observation and Thunder Strike. These will increase the damage you can do when performing an Unveiling Strike, where you can take an enemy by surprise.\nFor Rock Solid, Rock Mastery, Ironclad, and Bold Venture are particularly useful. With this combination of skills, when you're successful at Deflecting, you can recover Mana quickly, and take less damage for a short amount of time. With the Mana recovery and the Rock Mastery reducing the cooldown of the spell, you can get more use of Rock Solid in fights.\n### Best Strand Skills to Unlock\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Harmony**|  Gain Focus for each attack by Duplicates\n**Volition**|  Duplicates can use other spells like Ring of Fire, Rock Solid, and Immobilize\nYou'll want to spend Sparks increasing the duration, health, and attack power of your Duplicates first and then try to make them as useful as possible.\nTo do this, we'd suggest getting Harmoy and Volition. This will allow them the freedom to perform spells and have an effect on enemies, and also grant you Focus while they attack.\n### Best Transformations Skills to Unlock\nSkill Name | Description\n---|---\n**Moon Roam**|  Damage is increased after a Perfect Dodge\n**Evergreen**|  Might decay is reduced\n**Ferocious Form**|  Attack is increased while Transformed\nTransformations add some spice to combat and can be hugely beneficial, especially as they have completely different health and status bars to your character.\nWhen you're transformed, you want the Transformation to last as long as possible and deal as much damage as you can. The combination of Moon Roam, Evergreen, and Ferocious Form will allow you to do just that.\nIf you want to spend additional Sparks in this category, Might Reserve will let you keep some Might when you transform back into primate form and Hidden Might increases your max Might level.",

After unlocking the Gourd in Chapter 1, you can start to capture the spirits of enemies and use them in battle. But if you're searching for tips on what the best spirits to use are, here's what we'd recommend.\nLooking for information on every Spirit in the game and how to collect them? Visit our Spirit Locations page.",
        "h2_content": "When you use a Spirit, you will temporarily transform into them and be able to perform their special move. Alongside these skills, each Spirit provides a boost to a general stat or status effect, such as an increase in Poison damage or an increase in Defense when performing a particular move like Rock Solid.\nUnlike Transformations, you will share the same health bar with Spirits, so it's crucial to pull them out at the right time. Not sure which Spirits to equip? Here are some we consider to be the best spirits to use in Black Myth: Wukong.\nWandering Wight| Guangmou| Tiger's Acolyte\n---|---|---\nBlade Monk| Non-White| Falcon Hermit\nClay Vajra| Flint Vanguard| Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang (Upgraded)\nRemember that Spirits can be upgraded! At any Keeper's Shrine, you can choose to Cultivate Spirits from the Self-Advance menu. This will allow you to upgrade your Spirits using a combination of Will and items like Blood of the Iron Bull and Tadpoles. If you like a Spirit, cultivate them so you can max out their buffs.\n### Wandering Wight\nThis Spirit is entirely missable if you get to the end of Chapter 1 without picking it up, but you'll also likely encounter it before you've got your Gourd. Thankfully, you can pick it up from the nearest Keeper's Shrine once you've got the Gourd, and we'd recommend you do so because it's a great one to have equipped especially in the early game.\nThe Wandering Wight provides a substantial buff to your defence, which can make all the difference in fights. Not only this, but its Faithful Kowtow special attack allows you to deal a chunk of damage by smashing the giant's head into an enemy.\n### Guangmou\nThis is another Spirit you can collect from Chapter 1, and with it, you can use the Veiled Vipers special attack. When you perform this, four snakes will appear to help you out, dealing poison damage to enemies.\nYou'll gain a moderate increase in the poison damage you deal, and have the added bonus of poison resistance alongside it. Even if you're not going up against too many enemies that use poison attacks, you will find plenty are susceptible to poison damage and the status will build up letting you chip away at an enemy's health bar while you use other moves.\n### Gore-Eye Daoist\nIf you want to make the most of the spells you can cast, the Gore-Eye Daoist moderately buffs your Maximum Mana levels. To complement the equipped effect, his Raging Blood attack sees him create an area that will enhance your attacks along as you stay inside the glow.\n### Tiger's Acolyte\nIt's a fairly simple attack that the Tiger's Acolyte offers, but Sharp Edge is a quick hack-and-slash move that can deal a chunk of damage. In addition to the move, you'll also gain a moderate increase in Critical Damage, so using it at the right time can be a powerful attack. As another added bonus, the Qi cost of using Tiger's Acolyte is moderate, while most others are high.\n### Blade Monk\nThe Slaughter attack the Blade Monk can pull out allows you to swing a huge greatsword twice and then smash it down on a foe. You'll also get a moderate attack buff as soon as you've taken down an enemy.\n### Non-White\nNon-White's Bone Spikes attack allows him to leap forward and spin at the same time, getting close to targets quickly and hitting them. The immediate follow-up to this is he'll sprout thorns to stab an enemy, prolonging the attack. In the same way that Gangmou is useful for Poison Damage, so is the Non-White Spirit. Alongside the moderate buff to Poison Damage, you'll also get a moderate increase to Frost Damage, so aim for a two-pronged attack that allows you to inflict both elements.\n### Falcon Hermit\nThe Falcon Hermit Spirit uses Frosty Wind, which is another way you can freeze enemies in place. Frosty Wind appears like a tornado, moving around and battering enemies that stand in its way. It's great for crowd control and offers the chance to freeze enemies in place, so you can follow up quickly with your own attacks.\n### Clay Vajra\nIf you've got to Chapter 3 and encountered a Clay Vajra, you'll know they're a walking fire machine, and who wouldn't want to use that as an attack? Flames of Doom will see the Clay Vajra shoot fire from its knees in a wide arc, meaning you can deal with groups or cover a large area when attacking. The buff you'll receive for having this Spirit equipped is burn resistance, so it's also great to use against enemies that deliver fire attacks themselves.\n### Flint Vanguard\nThe Flint Vanguard, which you can acquire in Chapter 5 packs a real punch in fights. Firstly, its Flaming Flint attack sees it continuously pummel the ground and enemies directly in front of it. This in itself deals quite a bit of damage, but as it attacks, it also builds Scorch Bane. If you can land enough attacks on an enemy, it will be inflicted with Burn Damage, helping you hugely by inflicting status damage for a short period of time while you continue to attack.\n### Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang/Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang\nThough this definitely doesn't start as the best spirit in the game as Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, if you find and defeat all 6 frog bosses, you can upgrade this spirit to Mythical level where it becomes Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang. When it reaches Mythical status, you essentially have a frog randomizer that deals elemental damage. Tongue Whip becomes an attack, where a different version of the frog bosses will appear, allowing you to inflict Lightning, Ice, Poison, or Fire. The last option is a Stone frog, that will howl and roar.",

With this combination of skills, when you're successful at Deflecting, you can recover Mana quickly, and take less damage for a short amount of time. With the Mana recovery and the Rock Mastery reducing the cooldown of the spell, you can get more use of Rock Solid in fights.",
