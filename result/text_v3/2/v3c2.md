Q: What is the best strategy to quickly defeat Jiao-Loong of Waves, and how does its water-phase behavior affect the fight?
A:
To quickly defeat Jiao-Loong of Waves in *Black Myth: Wukong*, it is crucial to understand its attack patterns and water-phase behavior. Below, we outline the best strategies and how to adapt to its water-based tactics during the fight.

### Strategy to Defeat Jiao-Loong of Waves

Jiao-Loong of Waves is a water-based dragon with a limited but quick moveset, making it easier to predict its attacks. It primarily uses tail whips (either spinning or flipping), lunges, swipes, and pounces to catch you off guard. Here’s how to counter these moves:

1. **Stay Close and Use Heavy Attacks**: Jiao-Loong is not very steady on its feet, so staying close allows you to capitalize on its instability. Heavy attacks can knock it over or temporarily stun it, giving you ample time to deal significant damage. Using the **Plantain Fan** is particularly effective, as it can keep the boss knocked down for extended periods.
   
2. **Dodge and Jump**: For its lunges, tail whips, and pounces, simply dodging or jumping back is usually enough to avoid damage. Pay attention to its movements and be ready to evade.

3. **Be Wary of Its Roar**: Jiao-Loong can unleash a roar that stuns you for a few seconds. Watch for visual cues to avoid being caught off guard.

### Water-Phase Behavior and How to Adapt

When Jiao-Loong's health drops below 50%, it transitions into its water-phase behavior. During this phase, it dives into the water, becoming temporarily unreachable, and attacks unpredictably from below. Here’s how to handle this phase:

1. **Watch for Ripples**: The key to anticipating its attacks is to observe the water's surface. Ripples indicate where Jiao-Loong is about to emerge. Position yourself accordingly to dodge its surprise attacks.

2. **Beware of the Tail Whip**: While submerged, Jiao-Loong's tail may emerge in a tentacle-like fashion, attempting to strike you. These attacks can overlap, so you may need to dodge multiple strikes in quick succession.

3. **Use Spells Freely**: Since Jiao-Loong has a straightforward attack pattern, there’s no need to conserve spells. Utilize them liberally to deal damage quickly and end the fight efficiently.

### Summary

Jiao-Loong of Waves is a challenging but manageable boss if you stay close, use heavy attacks, and dodge its predictable moves. In its water phase, focus on reading the ripples and dodging its tail attacks. With these strategies, you can quickly defeat this optional Yaoguai Chief and progress through Chapter 6 of *Black Myth: Wukong*.
