Yellow Loong is the final of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n* Rewards: Golden Lining Transformation Spell, Sea-Supporting Tendon, Golden Carp Curio, Kun Steel, Loong Pearl, Mind Core, 6998 Experience, 5049 Will",
        "h2_content": "The Yellow Loong is the last of the four Loong bosses, and rather appropriately, he's an incredibly challenging fight. In fact, you may want to attempt this optional fight later on, especially after you've completed the rest of Chapter 4 and gotten tougher armor sets and weapons before challenging him. While he doesn't have a huge moveset, the attacks he does can some fast, and when imbued with lightning can often kill you before you're able to react.\nIf you do challenge him early, you should really consider arming yourself to the teeth: Upgrade the Loongscale Armor to reduce shock duration, stock up on every medicine you can think of in addition to Shock-Quelling Powder, and ask the Xu Dog for extra pills that may include rare ones that give you boosts of health or damage increases. Such a powerful foe is deserving of your good consumables -- but you may want to practice a bit first before using them in battle.\nYellow Loong has a few distinct attack he can perform, but you'll often find he always starts the fight with the same one: After charging up power, he'll dash forward to thrust with his glaive.\nAfter a brief moment, he'll perform a spinning strike that hits twice as he winds up and then slams down his glaive, dealing electric damage all the while. This is a good time to dodge and then get in a light combo, and then start on a new combo chain.\nUsually as you begin your second combo chain, he'll do one of two things. If he performs a spinning flip, he'll retreat backwards, but the end of your combo can usually chase after him and strike regardless.\nHowever, if you see him raise up his glaive, he'll strike downwards, which you can break off your attack to deflect with Rock Solid, or Immobilize him before the hit lands to finish your second combo.\nWhen using his other basic melee attacks this early, he can raise his weapon and brace it behind his raised right foot, before performing two quick downward slices, then dragging his weapon along the ground for a moment before unleashing a charged upward slice, which is a lot to dodge quickly, but it can be done.\nIf he flips his weapon before catching it, he'll quickly thrust it out in your direction, then jump toward you with a small side slash before doing a bigger sweeping spin with an electric wave of force around him, which you'll need to dodge around his side to keep pace with.\nFinally, he can perform two quick downward slashes with his weapon, and then bring his glaive back across his body in a huge arc that creates an electric wave in front of him.\nYou'll want to dodge toward him and not away and get the hang of evading this attack early, as it won't be long before he'll upgrade the move to detonate a second bigger orange electric arc a moment after the initial slice.\nSpeaking of which, his other quick melee move will begin with a quick stab from the opposite end of his weapon (while turning his back to you) followed by an electric overhead slam. Don't get greedy, because he'll quickly pull his weapon out to swing it around for a big spinning arc that also extends a huge electric wave, which will shortly detonate with a bigger orange blast that you need to be well away from.\nBe **very** wary if you see him whip his weapon around to stab you with the opposite tip without turning his body like the aforementioned attack. If he's able to stab you, it will become an unblockable grab that will almost always give you the Shocked Status, and deplete a huge amount of your health in the process!\nThe first half of this fight will largely come down to learning these moves and how best to avoid them, and chain together counters to keep him staggered. You can offload a lot of damage early before he starts using his bigger moves by chaining initial light combo attacks to build your Focus past three points, Rock Solid deflect to fill the fourth meter and chain that into a heavy attack riposte with either the Thrust or Pillar Stance.\nWhen he staggers back, follow up with a quick but damaging Spirit Attack to keep him staggered (something like the Earth Wolf can deal a lot if you get him cornered against a wall where you'll keep running into him), and then swap into a Transformation Spell to keep him on the defensive.\nTake care when using your Transformation Spells to maximize damage by not being too reckless, and conserve might and health by dodging anything he throws out. The Umbral Abyss is a good pick since you can attack right as you transform, and use the spell at full might to further stun and chill him.\nOnce you take off a good chunk of his health, the second \"phase\" will start, and things get extremely dangerous. It will begin when he stops fighting to charge up and release a blast of electricity around him.\nAfter he does this, he'll immediately fly at you low to the ground with a slash while imbued by electricity that is incredibly quick and hard to dodge -- and it only gets worse from here.\nHe'll spend the next several attacks floating up above you and dive-bombing in his electrified state, and though each dive-bomb looks the same, the timing is slightly different depending on his motions before attacking:\nTwirling his glaive over his head will buy you a second until he finishes the animation before flying at you, but if he holds his glaive pointed behind him, you'll have the smallest of moments to dodge before he charges you. He may also hold his weapon under his other arm, or angle it downward, and each has its own timing.\nWorse still, after dashing at you 2-3 times, he'll start alternating slams where he strikes the ground at your position with a huge lightning blast, rather than charging past you. This can also go on for several hits with different wind-up speeds, and when electrified, a single mistake can spell doom.\nThere is one caveat: The key to surviving this attack string is to stop it before it starts, and there are a few special ways to stop him:\nThe easiest way to do so is to immediately trigger the Wind Tamer Vessel you get from Chapter 2's Secret area the second you see him charge up. The blast will immediately stun him, and he will be unable to complete the charge (the downside is you usually only have enough Qi to use it once, and he's known to employ this move multiple times).\nIf you have 3 focus points already banked, you can also quickly unleash a charged strike with the Thrust Stance to stagger him out of, but your reaction speed will need to be very quick.\nThe other way to stop him is to let him charge up, but then immediately shift into Rock Solid the second he releases the blast and flies at you for his initial swipe. It's this attack and this one only that will completely knock the wind out of him, and stop him from performing the rest of his dive-bombs and slams, which will not stagger him if you try deflecting those.\nEven outside this new attack of his, the last half of the fight will be even deadlier as he follows up many of his basic attacks with more sweeps and spins than before.\nOne of the more annoying new moves he'll employ is his own ability to \"Cloud Step\" to evade some of your moves. One of these he'll often perform at the end of a combo attack, ducking to the side, and then performing a jump where he stabs the ground with his polearm, and flips over to slam his tail down for a two-hit strike.\nThe other move is even more aggravating, as he can Cloud Step without warning even when standing around between moves if you try to attack, and can completely waste a fully charged strike. He'll dash backward while intangible, then quickly race forward to strike -- though you can turn that tables by deflecting his counter-attack.\nBecause of this, its often better to rely on building your focus with light attack combos, and only unleash heavy attacks after deflecting with Rock Solid for an instant hit that he won't have time to dodge. Getting your meter filled to the fourth focus point also ensures you'll be dealing the best possible damage that will knock him down every time.\nExpect this fight to take a lot of attempts as you learn the different ways he can string his combos together, when the best times are to catch him off guard, and - most importantly - practice dodging his lightning dive-bomb attacks that can kill your attempt in an instant. Try to get rid of the Shocked status effect any time you get inflicted, so long as you don't leave yourself open while doing so.\nOnce Yellow Loong is finally revealed, his fate will be sealed, as the Ancient Master whose garment he was hiding in will convince the ancient dragon to relinquish his power, channeling it into his polearm, which you can grab to obtain the Golden Lining Transformation Spell to become a Loong yourself!

        "h2_content": "While the Cyan Loong is a bit smaller than Black Loong, he is much more ferocious, and can use his lightning powers to quickly deal double damage and tear you to pieces -- especially if you choose to face him after arriving on Turtle Island. You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive. You should also have the Loongwreathe or Kang-Jin Staff, and have a good set of spells equipped that compliment your attacks -- we reccomend Immobilize and Rock Solid, but you can also try using the Ring of Fire to buff yourself up in since the arena is small.\nThe Cyan Loong doesn't have a huge amount of attacks, but when they hit, they hit hard!\nOne of his most common attacks will have him briefly swim toward you before diving in to perform two standing sword slashes in quick succession. He'll follow up by floating high and charging up lightning in his hand to strike the ground in front of him, requiring you to dodge both the attack and the resulting strike that appears at the point he touches.\nExpect him to also utilize his sword slashes in simple 1 or 2 hit attacks, or use his lightning palm attack on its own. His sword swings aren't too fast, but they can blindside you if you aren't ready to break off your attacks or use up all your stamina.\nAnother dangerous attack he can launch with little warning only comes with a small tell -- when he quickly swaps his sword to hold in a reverse grip behind his back. He'll then quickly launch himself through the air at you with a spinning slash that can take a chunk off your health, and then dive back to your position after a moment for sword slice when he reaches the ground.\nThe good news is his final sword slice allows for an extended moment to dodge around and attack him from behind. However, you'll need to keep your eyes open when trying to attack from behind, as he can easily whip his mace-like tail around to hit you. Watch for it to rise up to the top left before slashing down to the bottom right to know when to deflect or evade.\nIn addition to his standard sword swings and combos, the Cyan Loong can change things up by charging up and holding his sword back pointed straight at you before launching into a slow two-handed swing, or pausing to spin for a backhand slash as he whirls around.\nThe good news is with his form only slightly bigger than yours, the Cyan Loong is fairly susceptible to being staggered. Even a full Light Combo can send him stumbling backward, which you can mix in with a varied combo and follow up from the Smash Stance, stagger his sword swings with Rock Solid, and use a bulky Spirit attack like the Second Rat Prince to send him sprawling again and again and limit his ability to attack back.\nHowever, once you manage to get his health down to around half, he'll imbue his sword with electricity in drawn out flourish, ending with him stabbing the sword into the ground to send up electric blasts all around him. You can try poking him from a distance with the Thrust Stance but be wary not to get too close.\nWith his freshly empowered sword, Cyan Loong will deal more damage than ever before. A single sword swing can cleave your health apart, and if you already have the shock status effect, you can easily die in a single hit if you aren't careful. Be sure to counter this new phase with Evil Repelling Medicament to increase your defense, and have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand for any moment you do get the status effect.\nSeveral of his moves have also been improved. His electric palm strike for instance now causes several lightning strikes in front of him, up from just a single blast, requiring you to dodge around to his sides instead of backward.\nIf he begins to hold his sword back while pointing at you, the air will crackle around him preventing you from getting close, and his two-handed sword swing will also unleash an electric projectile slash you'll need to evade.\nThe good news is that his blade won't stay enchanted forever, often ending with the previously mentioned attack. Once you no longer see electricity crackling along his blade, that's your cue to go back to pressing the attack by getting in staggering blows.\nIn particular, we recommend the Red Tides transformation spell to evade around his attacks while burning him, as he swings are slow enough that you can have an easier time performing the wolf guai's ultimate spell attack for big damage.\nThis fight will largely come down to learning his moves enough that you can anticipate and avoid his powerful attacks, and find your opening to keep him staggered and on the defensive. Once you learn how to keep away from his sword swings, you'll be able to take him down for good.\nWhen he falls, you'll earn some Fine Gold Thread and another Loong Pearl, and can loot a nearby chest that appears for the Mountain-Shaking Claw material and Breath of Fire Soak for your Gourd. This new material will unlock the upgrade path for your Loongwreathe Staff into the Golden Loong Staff, but you'll need to find and defeat the last of the four Loongs to craft it.\nCyan Loong",

        "h2_content": "The Black Loong is a fearsome dragon standing on two legs and wielding a pair of giant maces imbued with his electricity, which he can employ to create different kinds of shockwaves that deal incredible damage. Though you can face him early on in Chapter 2 once you find the Loong Scales, it’s recommended you wait until you’ve completed Chapter 2 or even started Chapter 3 before taking him on.\nIn particular, it’s a good idea to stock up on medicine to increase your shock resistance, and buy the Thunderbolt Horn Soak from the Shen Monkey as well.\nAny time you see the Black Loong’s weapons flare to life and crackle, you can expect them to detonate with massive electrical explosions whenever they slam into the ground. In particular, he can use a large leaping slam to cause a sizable explosion you’ll need to avoid with a well-timed dodge. He’ll often end this slam by dragging his weapons around to his sides, so try to evade backwards or get around to his back before retaliating.\nHe also has a variety of melee swings - sometimes swinging both weapons in slow arcs to slam in the ground one after the other before a third and final electrical slam. Other times he’ll alternate slamming the ground with each weapon while it’s imbued on either side of his body.\nThe Black Loong has a particularly devastating but slow combo where he’ll begin to swing a weapon in the air above his head and then swing it down in a sweeping electrical arc in front of him, before doing the same as his other weapon. Thankfully the movements are very slow and easy to dodge if you aren’t using up all your stamina when attacking. They do however send out currents in front of him, so don’t think that just backpedaling will be enough to stop you from getting hurt.\nSometimes he’ll end the two sweeping electrical swings by finally bringing both weapons together in front of him, and create a shockwave with an expanding electrical ring as they connect that you’ll need to dodge or jump over — or even rise up on your Pillar Stance to retaliate with a heavy attack as it passes under you.\nAnother lengthy combo that can be hard to get away from will be when Black Loong starts to repeatedly pound the ground with alternate weapon slams, expelling electric blasts from each one. This can go on for up to nine slams, with the final attack being the one that causes the biggest explosion. If you try to interrupt him with Immobilize, be sure to follow up with a strong attack that can stagger, or he’ll simply keep the combo going.\nIf you spot the Black Loong raising his weapons high in a slow manner while they crackle to life, it’s a sign he’s going to bang them together slowly three times, causing explosions in the air that gradually increase in range. This is a good time to sprint to safety and use your medicines while you wait for the attack to end.\nHowever, the most dire of his attacks will come when he seems to emit even more electricity coming from his mouth and arcing around his body. Listen carefully to the drumbeat of the music, as he’ll start to pound the very earth in time with the drum beats, causing several rings of electric energy to expel outward.\nGetting hit by even a few of these will quickly deplete your healthbar, and you’ll have to stop everything to focus on evasion. While it is possible to get on top of your staff in the Pillar Stance, each electric ring will take a chunk out of your stamina, and this segment lasts far too long to wait out in this style.\nYou need to also be ready for his final slam, which he’ll do with both weapons, but won’t send out a ring. He’s being sneaky here to lure you into advancing on him, but will detonate his weapons after a pause to send out one final quick electric ring!\nOne method to evade reliably is to listen to the drum beats to anticipate the spacing of the rings, and then dodge parallel to Black Loong, moving from side to side as you evade, instead of toward the next ring or backward into a previous one. It will take a bit of practice, so having electric resistance augmented can help when you slip up.\nAnother cheekier way to evade this attack is to simply find some high ground. There are a few raised rocks in the arena — some that he may destroy over time — but can be used to get off the floor where the electric rings travel. There’s one large rock as you first enter the arena, two more near the back on either side of the stairs, and one more opposite the stairs in the far corner.\nFinally, Black Loong can also employ a sandstorm similar to the Yellow Wind Sage. He’ll start to spin his weapons around as he marches toward you, and a sandstorm vortex will spread out to capture you within. You’ll be essentially pulled into its grip, forcing you extremely close to Black Loong, at which point he’ll stop spinning his weapons and slam them outward from his body, causing a massive detonation that’s hard to dodge with low visibility and movement options.\nLuckily, just like the Yellow Wind Sage, you can negate this attack entirely by using the Wind Tamer Vessel gained from defeating the Fuban boss of the Chapter 2 Secret area. This will not only shatter the sandstorm, but stun him for several seconds as well!\nLearning the electric ring dance is arguably the hardest part of this fight, as is evading his sandstorm if you can’t dissipate it. Immobilize can help you get some breathing room, but it’s harder to stagger him out of attacks, and even Rock Solid deflections aren’t guaranteed to stop his assaults. However, the Azure Dust Transformation can reliably keep him stumbling with many of its attacks, and sometimes even knock him out of his attempts to create rings of electricity altogether! You can also try using the Pluck of Many to disorient him with attacks on all sides, and use that time wisely to charge up your strikes when he’s distracted.\nWhen the Black Loong falls, you’ll earn plenty of rewards, including a Loong Pearl, Mind Core, 2 Refined Iron Sand, 1576 Will, and 2770 Experience. In addition to this, you can find a gold chest nearby that contains a Tridacna Pendant curio, and a Thunderbone weapon material — one of two Loong materials needed to craft the Loongwreathe Staff!\nBlack Loong",

The section summary is: Black Loong is an optional secret Yaoguai King boss fight that you can encounter in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong. Hidden beyond a waterfall of sand in the Fright Cliff, you won't be able to encounter this boss until you obtain a Key Item elswhere in this chapter, Black Loong is one of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials.\n* **Rewards:** Tridacna Pendant, Thunderbone, Loong Pearl x1, Refined Iron Sand x2, Mind Core x1 This excerpt merges content from both the main and sub-sections. The sub-section is titled 'Black Loong Boss Fight and Guide', and the detailed content is as follows:\nThe Black Loong is a fearsome dragon standing on two legs and wielding a pair of giant maces imbued with his electricity, which he can employ to create different kinds of shockwaves that deal incredible damage. Though you can face him early on in Chapter 2 once you find the Loong Scales, it’s recommended you wait until you’ve completed Chapter 2 or even started Chapter 3 before taking him on.\nIn particular, it’s a good idea to stock up on medicine to increase your shock resistance, and buy the Thunderbolt Horn Soak from the Shen Monkey as well.\nAny time you see the Black Loong’s weapons flare to life and crackle, you can expect them to detonate with massive electrical explosions whenever they slam into the ground. In particular, he can use a large leaping slam to cause a sizable explosion you’ll need to avoid with a well-timed dodge. He’ll often end this slam by dragging his weapons around to his sides, so try to evade backwards or get around to his back before retaliating.\nHe also has a variety of melee swings - sometimes swinging both weapons in slow arcs to slam in the ground one after the other before a third and final electrical slam. Other times he’ll alternate slamming the ground with each weapon while it’s imbued on either side of his body.\nThe Black Loong has a particularly devastating but slow combo where he’ll begin to swing a weapon in the air above his head and then swing it down in a sweeping electrical arc in front of him, before doing the same as his other weapon. Thankfully the movements are very slow and easy to dodge if you aren’t using up all your stamina when attacking. They do however send out currents in front of him, so don’t think that just backpedaling will be enough to stop you from getting hurt.\nSometimes he’ll end the two sweeping electrical swings by finally bringing both weapons together in front of him, and create a shockwave with an expanding electrical ring as they connect that you’ll need to dodge or jump over — or even rise up on your Pillar Stance to retaliate with a heavy attack as it passes under you.\nAnother lengthy combo that can be hard to get away from will be when Black Loong starts to repeatedly pound the ground with alternate weapon slams, expelling electric blasts from each one. This can go on for up to nine slams, with the final attack being the one that causes the biggest explosion. If you try to interrupt him with Immobilize, be sure to follow up with a strong attack that can stagger, or he’ll simply keep the combo going.\nIf you spot the Black Loong raising his weapons high in a slow manner while they crackle to life, it’s a sign he’s going to bang them together slowly three times, causing explosions in the air that gradually increase in range. This is a good time to sprint to safety and use your medicines while you wait for the attack to end.\nHowever, the most dire of his attacks will come when he seems to emit even more electricity coming from his mouth and arcing around his body. Listen carefully to the drumbeat of the music, as he’ll start to pound the very earth in time with the drum beats, causing several rings of electric energy to expel outward.\nGetting hit by even a few of these will quickly deplete your healthbar, and you’ll have to stop everything to focus on evasion. While it is possible to get on top of your staff in the Pillar Stance, each electric ring will take a chunk out of your stamina, and this segment lasts far too long to wait out in this style.\nYou need to also be ready for his final slam, which he’ll do with both weapons, but won’t send out a ring. He’s being sneaky here to lure you into advancing on him, but will detonate his weapons after a pause to send out one final quick electric ring!\nOne method to evade reliably is to listen to the drum beats to anticipate the spacing of the rings, and then dodge parallel to Black Loong, moving from side to side as you evade, instead of toward the next ring or backward into a previous one. It will take a bit of practice, so having electric resistance augmented can help when you slip up.\nAnother cheekier way to evade this attack is to simply find some high ground. There are a few raised rocks in the arena — some that he may destroy over time — but can be used to get off the floor where the electric rings travel. There’s one large rock as you first enter the arena, two more near the back on either side of the stairs, and one more opposite the stairs in the far corner.\nFinally, Black Loong can also employ a sandstorm similar to the Yellow Wind Sage.
