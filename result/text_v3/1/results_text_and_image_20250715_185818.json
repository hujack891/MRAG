        "h2_content": "The Monk from the Sea is essentially a supercharged version of the already tough Sea Monks you've been encountering since escaping the Pagoda Realm's prison. While you may recognize a good number of his moves, you'll soon find that he's also been infused with a lot of frost power, and can quickly chill and render you immobile before dealing a killing blow. As such, having chill-resistant items and curios will be of great help here.\nBy now you're well aware of this Monk's ability to use their tentacles to strike at you form a distance, both in a three-hit combos to stab outward, or in spinning horizontal sweeps. By recognizing the timing, you can make good use of deflecting these attacks or immobilizing him mid swing.\nIn addition to his large snowy boulder throw for massive damage, he can also toss two smaller rocks when at a far distance, but they deal less damage and are easier to step away from.\nWhat really makes this Yaoguai a Chief is his ability to invoke frost damage. Whenever you spot him rise up in the air on his two appendages and create a gust around him, he's actually coating the area in frost, which will quickly raise your frost meter while in the area.\nConsidering how snowy the area already is, this can be quite dangerous as it's hard to tell where the affected area is. Look carefully for a low mist, or try to reposition yourself in a non snow-covered area to see when its been painted over in white.\nIt'll take a lot of repositioning to survive this fight, and you'll also need to be aware of one other new attack that seems harmless but can deal a good amount of damage, as the Monk from the Sea can either leap toward or away from you with a deceptive blast.\nIf he uses it to jump at you, he'll use his appendages to stab down as he lands, and after a pause, will slam down to the ground that creates another damaging blast.\nDefeating this Yaoguai Chief will boast an unexpected reward: Hoarfrost. With this, you'll be able to utilize a new Transformation Spell to become a Monk from the Sea, and inflict your own frost damage on enemies to chill them!\nMonk from the Sea\nNow that you've dealt with the Yaoguai Chief, you can explore this large size plaza. Up ahead, you'll find several Overseeing Monks praying to a Turtle General statue and three more practicing punching a large tree (you can sidestep them and keep on the main path if you wish since they won't notice you unless you draw close).\nHead down the stairs, where you'll find another sealed building on the right guarded by an Overseeing Monk and some Thunder Rhino Masters, and several sets of stairs to the left.\nTake the very first staircase down to a lower platform on the left with a small hut guarded by a Supporter Monk.\nJust past him you can follow a small path to a pavilion, where you'll encounter a Wolf Guardian. Defeat him, and you'll earn a **Bronze Buddha Pendant Curio**.\nYou'll also find a small turtle chest on the pavilion's table itself, and opening it will reveal the **Sweet Ice** Soak for your Gourd Drink, giving you extra chill resistance after consuming your drink.\nBefore heading down the main stairs to a fearsome looking foe, head all the way around to the far stairs, which leads to another small building where two Thunder Rhino Masters overlook the enemy below. You'll want to take them out so they can't give him support.\nAfter defeating these two mages, turn around and look at the side of the small red building to find a **Treasure Chest** with materials inside.\nNow you can head down the main stairs to encounter this new foe, a Clay Vajra. While he may look like a Yaoguai Chief, this is just a very formidable Yaoguai (that thankfully doesn't respawn).\nThe four-legged creatures can emit fire from several places -- using a large opening on its chest to emit a huge flamethrower you'll need to Immobilize to shut down or stay well away from.\nThe creatures also has little mouths on each of its kneecaps that can also emit flames, and while they don't travel as far, the monster will constantly spin around to shoot fire on all sides.\nIt will often follow up these attacks by utilizing it's spear to charge forward in a thrust attack, or slam it into the ground, pivot, and pull it out again with a wide slash while also breathing fire from its knees. If you see the monster draw in power, be ready for a torrent of a fireball that will shoot your way and cannot be deflected with a staff spin, requiring you to dodge instead.\nThe large gateway at the end of this path is guarded by three Overseeing Monks, one apart from the others, but all can be lured away independently due to their short-range senses.",
        "promot": "This is an excerpt from the file 'New_Thunderclap_Temple_Walkthrough.md', located in the main section titled 'New Thunderclap Temple Walkthrough'. The section summary is: The New Thunderclap Temple is the final main region of Chapter 3 in The New West in Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.\n* **Jump to a Section:**\n* **Temple Entrance**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Monk from the Sea\n* **Temple Main Plaza**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Void\n* **Temple Inner Courtyard**\n* Yaoguai Chief - Non-Pure\n* **Mahavira Hall**\n* Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow\n* Yaoguai Chief - Macaque Chief\n* Yaoguai King - Yellowbrow (Round Two)\nNow that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits.\nThe temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up. This excerpt merges content from both the main and sub-sections. The sub-section is titled 'Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Monk from the Sea', and the detailed content is as follows:\nThe Monk from the Sea is essentially a supercharged version of the already tough Sea Monks you've been encountering since escaping the Pagoda Realm's prison. While you may recognize a good number of his moves, you'll soon find that he's also been infused with a lot of frost power, and can quickly chill and render you immobile before dealing a killing blow. As such, having chill-resistant items and curios will be of great help here.\nBy now you're well aware of this Monk's ability to use their tentacles to strike at you form a distance, both in a three-hit combos to stab outward, or in spinning horizontal sweeps. By recognizing the timing, you can make good use of deflecting these attacks or immobilizing him mid swing.\nIn addition to his large snowy boulder throw for massive damage, he can also toss two smaller rocks when at a far distance, but they deal less damage and are easier to step away from.\nWhat really makes this Yaoguai a Chief is his ability to invoke frost damage. Whenever you spot him rise up in the air on his two appendages and create a gust around him, he's actually coating the area in frost, which will quickly raise your frost meter while in the area.\nConsidering how snowy the area already is, this can be quite dangerous as it's hard to tell where the affected area is. Look carefully for a low mist, or try to reposition yourself in a non snow-covered area to see when its been painted over in white.\nIt'll take a lot of repositioning to survive this fight, and you'll also need to be aware of one other new attack that seems harmless but can deal a good amount of damage, as the Monk from the Sea can either leap toward or away from you with a deceptive blast.\nIf he uses it to jump at you, he'll use his appendages to stab down as he lands, and after a pause, will slam down to the ground that creates another damaging blast.\nDefeating this Yaoguai Chief will boast an unexpected reward: Hoarfrost.
