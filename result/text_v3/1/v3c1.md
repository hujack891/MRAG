Q: Where is Clay Vajra located?
A:
The Clay Vajra in *Black Myth: Wukong* is located at the **New Thunderclap Temple**. Specifically, it can be found guarding the entrance to the temple's main courtyard, which is situated near the back of the complex. Players must fight their way through the temple grounds to reach the Clay Vajra.

This formidable, four-legged creature poses a significant challenge, and defeating it not only progresses the story but also allows players to absorb its spirit. This grants access to its unique powers, including the "Flames of Doom" ability, which provides both offensive and defensive advantages in the game.
