This will make it easier for him to move around the arena, but he'll also kick it out and send this to attack you independently. When this is introduced, he'll be able to burn you.\nThe problem with this attack is there are two types of heavy attacks he'll perform here and they can be hard to avoid.\nHe'll either launch himself at you and then spin the unicycle around until he flips it up and lands down heavily where you are, or he'll start to spin around the entirety of the arena and multiple duplicates of the unicycle will appear. These will then launch into a crisscross attack to get you, and he'll follow up with a heavy attack.\nWhen his health is down to the last third, he will cover the arena with a red haze, reducing the size of the arena that you'll fight the creature in. He will also begin to use two swords instead of one. This is when you want to throw out the Plantain Fan. It will clear the red haze immediately and continuously stun him, giving you more time to whittle down his health.\nSupreme Celestial Inspector"
