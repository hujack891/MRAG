Q: How to Find the Supreme Celestial Inspector?
A:
To find the Supreme Celestial Inspector in *Black Myth: Wukong*, follow these steps based on the detailed walkthrough for Chapter 6:

The Supreme Celestial Inspector is the first major boss you encounter in Chapter 6. Begin by proceeding down the linear path from your spawn point. Continue along the slope until you reach the first Keeper's Shrine. From there, head straight up into a clearing adorned with large chains. This location marks the confrontation site with the Supreme Celestial Inspector.

Upon reaching the clearing, the character Bajie will comment that the area seems like a dead end. However, the Supreme Celestial Inspector will soon appear, initiating the boss fight. If you collected all the Purple Talismans in Chapter 4, the Inspector may already be familiar to you.

The Supreme Celestial Inspector is a winged creature that uses a combination of aerial attacks, projectiles, and elemental abilities. At the start of the fight, it primarily employs thunder-based attacks, so itâ€™s advisable to stock up on Shock-Quelling Powder and equip gear that boosts resistance to shock. As the battle progresses, fire-based attacks are introduced, so Body-Cooling Powder will also be helpful. The final phase of the fight combines both thunder and fire attacks.

The Inspector often takes to the air, making it difficult to reach. It also uses its wings to block attacks by turning them into solid gold, which reduces the effectiveness of your strikes. During these moments, wait for the wings to spread again and take advantage of Bajie's support, as he can heal you during this phase. Additionally, the Inspector wields a sword that emits red energy, which is the source of its thunder-based attacks.

Lastly, when the Inspector is airborne, it launches projectiles that must be dodged. Using the Plantain Fan can bring the boss down, leaving it vulnerable to attacks. Stay aggressive while Bajie assists you, and reserve your health-restoring items for later phases of the fight.
