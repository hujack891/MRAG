You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Look for the golden tree near where you saw the Feng-Tail General and Water-Wood Beast. 

The golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin. 

## Emerald-Armed Mantis Boss Fight and Guide

Zhu Bajie will be on the floor and pick up a mantis from the ground. It will hop inside Bajie's mouth, and you'll need to do the same to be able to fight the insect. You'll soon be transformed and literally entering the belly of the beast.

Note! If you die here, you'll be automatically transported back to near Zhu Bajie. There's a nearby Mantis-Catching Swamp that can also be activated, just behind where Bajie stands against the tree. To get back inside him, approach him and talk to him. 

Because the fight takes place inside Bajie's stomach, the area is limited. You'll find the mantis hacking and slashing away at the lining of Bajie's stomach, and it will soon turn its attention to you.

The first thing to take note of is the two blades it has for arms. It will use this to perform a combo of melee attacks, which mainly start with it raising both blades and stabbing them down into the pool of stomach contents you'll be wading through. As the blades land, this is a moment of vulnerability for the mantis, that will allow you to attack.

It will then start to use one blade at a time, and start to slash away. Occasionally, this will see the mantis spin around in a circle with the blades doing the same.

It's only when the mantis' health bar drops to around 70% that the fight changes drastically. A cutscene will  and the mantis will sharpen its blades, then dip them in the liquid, pulling them out so that they're now red.

The mantis will now become quite erratic with its movements, flipping all around the stomach. Immobilize will help out with this, but so will the Plantain Fan, which will push the Mantis back to a part of the stomach and pin it there for you to attack. It will also stop it from being able to fly too much in the air.

Along with these attacks, the mantis will sometimes fly up and start to slash its blades, but send out projectiles instead. Its combos will become more agile, and it will often spin around again and again with its blades creating circles around it.

Transformations are also useful here, and we found that Red Tides proved handy once again. The mantis is susceptible to burn damage, so it will chip away at its health bar while you follow up with attacks. 

When the mantis is dead, you'll receive Dian-Cui Loong-Soaring Bracers. With all the main bosses finished, for now, it's time to follow Zhu Bajie up the mountain. On the way though, there are just two more optional bosses to capture to wrap up this portion of the Chapter.
