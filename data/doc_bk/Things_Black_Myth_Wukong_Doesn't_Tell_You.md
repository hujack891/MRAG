### 1\. Keepers Shrines Will Keep Expanding

![Wukong KeeperUpdate.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/ca/Wukong_KeeperUpdate.jpg)

The Keeper Shrines where you place your incense are more than just a place to rest and recover. Though they’re limited at the start of the game, they’ll soon expand as you continue to progress. Not only will you be able to purchase items from a variety of stores depending on your location, but you’ll also eventually be able to craft Weapons and Armor directly from the shrines. 

![Wukong BlackWind 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/55/Wukong_BlackWind_7.jpg)

Many times, defeating a certain boss and obtaining a unique Crafting Material will unlock a new recipe, but you won't see it until you return to the Shrine to rest. This can apply to both Gear and Weapons. Later on, you'll even be able to craft Medicines once someone teaches you in Chapter 2. 

![Wukong SahalI 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8c/Wukong_SahalI_11.jpg)

Finally, it's important to note that all the Keeper's Shrines in a chapter share the same wares in the Store menu, but the offerings will differ in the next chapter, so always stock up before heading to the next big area. The only exception are marked "Secret Areas" you can unlock in a chapter -- find a Shrine in these places and check their shop for items you won't find elsewhere! 

### 2\. Always Speak to NPCs

![Wukong Bamboo 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1d/Wukong_Bamboo_7.jpg)

You’ll come across your fair share of NPCs in Black Myth: Wukong, and it pays to talk to them! Skipping these conversations (and some cases side quests) can be the difference between getting hold of key items and crafting abilities or not. Speak to NPCs sooner rather than later to unlock the chance to increase your Gourd’s healing abilities, craft Medicines, and more. 

![Wukong NewShop.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c3/Wukong_NewShop.jpg)

Most NPCs will remain in the area you find them, meaning you'll need to return to speak to them if they provide a service like selling goods or upgrading your Gourd. Other characters may show up in future chapters, provided you met them in previous chapters. 

Be sure to head back at the start of every new chapter to see if a merchant's stock has upgraded with new features! 

### 3\. It’s Really Easy to Reset Your Skills

![Wukong ResetSkills.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/32/Wukong_ResetSkills.jpg)

Want to switch up your game, or the skills you’ve unlocked just aren’t working for you? You can reset your skills in seconds. When you’re at a Keeper’s Shrine, go down to the Self-Advance menu and choose Reignite the Sparks. Without costing a thing you can recover all your Sparks and redistribute them however you wish. You can also do this for single skills if you don’t want to wipe all of them, but just want to take back one or two that you’re not getting on with. 

![Wukong RelicReset.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/71/Wukong_RelicReset.jpg)

Once you defeat a boss at the end of a chapter and earn one of the Six Relics of the Great Sage, you'll be given the option to awaken a single passive talent. These can also be reset in the Reignite the Sparks Menu, but you'll need to select the correct tab for Relics! 

### 4\. Additional Combat Styles Can Be Unlocked in the Skills Menu

Smash Stance is the standard stance you’ll begin the game with, but there are additional ones to be unlocked. With just one Spark, you can unlock the Pillar Stance and around Level 20, you can get the Thrust Stance. Once you’ve unlocked additional stances, you can swap between them during combat. 

![Wukong Shigandang 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c5/Wukong_Shigandang_11.jpg)

Each Stance can be invested in to serve different purposes -- for example, only the Smash Stance can interrupt an enemy attack with a well-timed Varied Combo, provided you unlock the required skill. The Pillar Stance can allow you to gain height while charging your heavy attack, and even nullify ground-based attacks! Other stances can help attack enemies from a safe distance, or hit multiple enemies with wider area-of-effect attacks! If you're having trouble against a tough enemy, try out other stances! 

### 5\. You Can Pick Up Missed Spirits at Keepers Shrines

![Wukong Bamboo 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c7/Wukong_Bamboo_8.jpg)

Before you meet the NPC that gives you the Gourd that allows you to absorb spirits, you’ll likely encounter some green wisps and maybe even side bosses that become spirits. Whether you have the Gourd or not, any spirits you don’t pick up can be collected at the Keeper’s Shrines so you don’t miss out on them. 

Trying to absorb a boss spirit early will prompt the phrase "Cannot absorb Spirit without Guidance." Not to worry, you'll be able to retrieve the Spirit once you gain the upgrade!

![Wukong Bamboo 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/49/Wukong_Bamboo_11.jpg)

If you ran into any Green Wisps early in Chapter 1 that only seemed to give a bit of Will before floating away, come back once you have the Gourd upgraded in the Bamboo Forest, and they can now be properly absorbed for much larger amounts of Will! 

### 6\. There’s No Penalties for Dying

![Wukong Death.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Wukong_Death.jpg)

Thankfully, if you die in Black Myth: Wukong, there are no penalties. You won’t drop items or any of the Will you’ve collected, you’ll just need to face off against any enemies you’ve already encountered. When you die, you’ll simply be transported back to the last Keeper’s Shrine you interacted with and have to run the gauntlet again. 

### 7\. Not All Items Are What They Appear to Be

You absolutely want to spend time collecting all the items you encounter as you explore the regions. They’re essential for crafting valuable items like Medicines as well as Armor and Weapons. However, not all items are what they appear to be! 

![Wukong Wolves 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cc/Wukong_Wolves_31.jpg)

Sometimes, when you’re gathering a mushroom or plucking a flower from the ground you’ll also find an enemy attached to it. So be prepared that sometimes when you’re foraging, you’ll also need to take down an enemy that emerges from the ground if you really want the item. 

Harvest a material enough times, and you may randomly get something else, like a Soak for your Gourd or Seeds to harvest more plants! 

### 8\. Look for Enemies With Blue Glowing Outlines

![Wukong Sandgate 78.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/92/Wukong_Sandgate_78.jpg)

When you’re exploring areas, you’ll sometimes encounter enemies that have bright blue glowing outlines around them. These enemies drop spirits, which you can add to your collection and equip at any time to help you out during fights. 

### 9\. It Pays to Backtrack

![Wukong MadTiger 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ef/Wukong_MadTiger_4.jpg)

Black Myth: Wukong is full of secrets, and you’ll quickly learn that backtracking and revisiting previous places and even Chapters is essential if you want to experience everything. Missing an entry from your notebook or have a feeling that a place holds a secret? It’s always worth returning to explore again, particularly after you’ve gained new key items. 

Sometimes this can be the key to unlocking hidden places and finding secret bosses. It’s also worth going back to NPCs and to previously visited shrine stores to see if they have new stock. 

### 10\. Meditation Spots Grant Skill Points

![Wukong Wolves 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/21/Wukong_Wolves_22.jpg)

Each region has a number of Meditation Spots to uncover and every time you take a quiet moment to reflect, you’ll gain Sparks. If you want to unlock all those skills quickly, it’s worth tracking down every Meditation Spot and enjoying a moment of calm. 

### 11\. Heavy Attacks Work Differently

![Wukong Wolves 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/dd/Wukong_Wolves_5.jpg)

Heavy attacks work very differently than in most action games, as their function differs depending on whether they’re used in or outside of a combo, and also depending on what stance you’re in. When used outside of a combo, they can be charged up to the number of focus points that you have unlocked, with each level of charge dramatically increasing the amount of damage the heavy attack will deal. 

When used in combos with the standard attack button, you'll perform a Varied Combo, assuming you’ve unlocked the specific Varied Combo from the skill tree in that stance. Varied combos require one point of focus, and unlike standalone heavy attacks, cannot be charged. That said, further upgrades can be purchased in the skill tree that can power them up and allow for follow up attacks that use additional focus points. 

![Wukong Wight 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3d/Wukong_Wight_1.jpg)

Note that the Smash Stance heavy attack is the best for single target damage, and that you can run while charging it, but it has by far the worst range. 

![Wukong RedLoong 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6a/Wukong_RedLoong_16.jpg)

The pillar stance heavy attack is quite slow, but does big AOE damage and can knock enemies flying off ledges. 

![Wukong Tiger 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/db/Wukong_Tiger_19.jpg)

And finally the Thrust Stance heavy attack does great single target damage from a long range, but like the pillar stance heavy attack, it requires you to stand completely still while charging. To unlock the pillar and thrust stances, you’ll need to be of a particular level, and you’ll need to put at least one spark into the respective trees. 

### 12\. Enter Photo Mode in Alternate Ways

It’s hidden in the bottom left corner of your pause screen, but you can enter photo mode with the button that’s listed there. But you don’t have to go into the menu to enter photo mode every time! 

You can hold down the right trigger and press that same button listed in the menu to go straight into it during game. Using an Xbox Controller, it’s the right trigger and the Back Button. 

### 13\. Get Permanent Upgrades with Celestial Medicines

![Wukong Tiger 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2e/Wukong_Tiger_30.jpg)

After reaching Chapter 2 and defeating the lightning frog in the small pool of water at the far end of the canyon, you’ll run into an NPC, the Xu Dog, who will grant you the ability to make medicines. While you can only make consumable Mortal Medicines at first when you stop at shrines, once you reach the Cellar Keeper’s Shrine below the Crouching Tiger Temple further into Chapter 2, you’ll run into Xu Dog again, and he’ll grant the ability to craft Celestial Medicines. 

![Wukong Tiger 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ec/Wukong_Tiger_31.jpg)

Celestial Medicines give permanent boosts to different stats, such as health, mana, stamina, and even certain Bane resistances. You consume Mind Cores to create these medicines, but can refund all of them at any time. You must return to Xu Dog every time you want to either create Celestial Medicines, or refund your Mind Cores.
