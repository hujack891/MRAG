## Gore-Eye Daoist Location

Gore-Eye Daoist can be found after defeating both the Stone Vanguard and Tiger Vanguard bosses. After defeating them, return to the area where you fought the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Price and place the Keenness of Tiger and Keenness of Stone items into the receptacle by the large stone door. Open the door, head down the hill, and over the bridge to reach an open cave area with a statue carved into the rock face.

The Gore-Eye Daoist is guarding a Luojia Fragrant Vine that you can use to empower your Gourd. Don't forget to pluck it off the tree after absorbing the Gore-Eye Daoist's Spirit. 

## Gore-Eye Daoist Fight

The fight against Gore-Eye Daoist is a rather difficult one. Here are the kind of moves you can expect to see: 

  * Staff Slam
  * Poison Projectiles
  * Blood Wave
  * Shock Wave

The Gore-Eye Daoist is a disturbing enemy with a large, bulbous tumor attached to his back that is covered in eyeballs. He mainly fights with his staff, which he uses as a blunt weapon. It also spews out large amounts of poisonous blood-red liquid over the battlefield. The blood makes the arena difficult to traverse, as any contact with the glowing center of the substance raises your poison meter. 

The Gore-Eye Daoist can also shoot solidified shards of blood at you from its many eyeballs, inflicting poison damage on impact. In addition to that, there is another staff slam move that the Gore-Eye Daoist does that releases a shock wave over the arena. There is a lot to contend with here. Take some Antimiasma Powder before you head into the fight, and don't skimp on your Immobilize or A Pluck of Many spells.

  * **Raging Blood**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Maximum Mana. 

If you don't mind becoming the nightmare-fuel that is the Gore-Eye Daoist, you can embody him for a moment to erect the poison blood staff on the battlefield. As the staff activates, it begins to emit a red glow. Staying inside the glow will empower your attack for as long as it remains there. This ability is akin to the Ring of Fire spell but designed to enhance attack rather than healing. Having the Gore-Eye Daoist equipped also boosts your maximum Mana, allowing you to cast more spells.
