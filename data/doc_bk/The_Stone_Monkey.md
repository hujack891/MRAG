Beyond the clearing where you fought the Son of Stones, you'll find a giant rock with golden trees on either side. Go left here.

You'll see a waterfall in the distance and an archway just before it. Go down to this archway and head inside, where you'll automatically dismount from the cloud. This will take you into Water Curtain Cave, which is the final area of the game.

At the start of Water Curtain Cave, go up the slope and to the cliff's edge. Run and jump across the gap to reach the path slightly below and be able to get behind the waterfall.

Head toward the path on the other side of the cave, where the lamp is glowing. Follow this until you reach the next section with a taller waterfall, then turn left.

Immediately, you'll see a giant staff in the center of the room. Make your way over to it and let the cutscene  out.

After another story from Zhu Bajie, the giant staff will shrink and you'll be able to get it from the body of water in front of you. Now that you've acquired the Jingubang and look exactly like Wukong, head to the back of the cave directly ahead. 

Follow the path to the peak, where you'll come to the Return Path Keeper's Shrine.

Continue up the path, where you'll have to face off against numerous soldiers along the way. This is really just a chance for you to test the power of Jingubang, and pick up some extra Will and Sparks. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(12\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/12/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2812%29.png)

About halfway up, Zhu Bajie loses his patience and transforms into a boar, knocking down a number of soldiers as he dashes off.

Just keep working your way up to the top of the path, taking out as many soldiers as you want along the way. You'll pass by a portion of the path covered in fire, and then enter into a cave. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(8\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0e/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%288%29.png)

Go to the top of the cave, then turn left, and follow the path until you need to squeeze through a gap in the wall.

When you emerge on the other side, you'll see the final stretch of the path that dips down and then slopes upward. Head for the top and activate the Peak of Innocence Keeper's Shrine, just before the end of the path. 

## Peak of Innocence

Make your way to the top of the peak and you'll find Zhu Bajie near a mysterious stone. Go over to the stone and interact with it to be transported to another realm.

On the other side, you'll find the Old Monkey. He'll tell you to step onto a boat, and then transport you across the water, while he recites the memories of Wukong. 

## Birthstone - Heart of Birthstone

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(14\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9b/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2814%29.png)

When the boat ride is over, you'll be at the Birthstone portion of the Water Curtain Cave. In the distance, you'll see a monkey sitting cross-legged in the water. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(17\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ac/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2817%29.png)

As the cutscene sees you move toward the Stone Monkey, you'll be automatically thrown into a fight against it. 

Note! You won't be able to activate the Heart of Birthstone Keeper's Shrine here unless you die, but if you do, you won't need to go back to a previous shrine – you'll automatically be transported back here. 

## Stone Monkey Boss Fight and Guide

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(15\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b9/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2815%29.png)

This fight has two phases, so be prepared for a tough battle and think about how you manage your Gourd and Spell usage throughout. You'll want to take in medicines that include Body-Warming and Body-Cooling Powder, as well as those that strengthen your attacks such as Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets and Loong Aura Amplification Pellets. You might prefer other medicines depending on the build you're ing with, such as the Mirage or Life-Saving Pill. 

The first thing to note is that the Stone Monkey, like other Stone enemies, is resistant to elemental attacks, so the best thing you can do here is have a build that focuses on high attack strength and increasing the chances of critical attacks. His resistance to these attacks should also influence the Transformation you take into the fight with you – we'd recommend Ebon Flow or Azure Dust, which can both deliver heavy blows. 

### The Stone Monkey Phase One

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(18\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/01/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2818%29.png)

During the first phase of the fight, the Stone Monkey will generally try to attack with a combo of punches. These can be avoided but it's best to use dodges to build up your focus quickly. Speed is key for this first phase, to keep as many of your medicines and Gourd uses available for the second phase. 

He will also leap up and pound his fists down onto the ground, causing a shockwave of rocks immediately around him. As long as you dive out of the way when he goes to land or step back from him slightly, you can avoid this attack. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(26\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a6/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2826%29.png)

When his health is down to around 70%, he will start to disappear occasionally and quickly reappear to catch you off guard. You can watch the ripples in the water to see where he'll approach from and quickly evade. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(25\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/92/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2825%29.png)

This will also be the time when he starts to glow slightly, indicating that his attacks will begin to differ. You'll now see that when he punches down on the ground, shockwaves will be sent out. You can jump or roll over these to dodge them. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(24\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d4/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2824%29.png)

Along with this move, you'll see that he will sometimes end the combo by keeping his hand in the water after punching down. The ground will start to pulse and he'll pull his first up, causing a shockwave of rocks to go upward. 

Two other attacks happen less frequently, but go on for longer and can be more dangerous. The first one is that now and then, he'll flash gold and your attacks will repel. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(29\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d7/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2829%29.png)

He'll freeze at this moment, and it can seem like a time to strike, but he's actually preparing to grab you. If he's able to, a small cutscene s where you're thrown and slammed on the ground either side of him. The second attack is when he goes berserk and starts slamming his fists down on the ground around him more violently and quicker than his usual attack. 

Your aim during this portion of the fight should be to dodge attacks while building focus, and max out the four Focus Points as soon as possible. With Wukong's armor and staff, these won't deplete, so you can land impressive heavy attacks with the staff. 

### Stone Monkey Phase Two

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(22\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/42/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2822%29.png)

When you've depleted his health bar, a cutscene will . The Stone Monkey's arms will start to glow, and suddenly, they'll be ablaze. This is when the second phase of the fight starts, which is far more difficult, and his health bar will be fully replenished. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(19\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9a/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2819%29.png)

The important thing to remember for this second phase is that the attacks he performs don't really change from the first phase. He just replaces the rocks with fire and ice. But the trickiest part of the fight is how quickly and often he switches between the use of frost of fire. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(20\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a7/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2820%29.png)

There are multiple things to consider if you're struggling with this portion of the fight, such as taking in the Fire Vessel to help protect against burn damage, and the Body-Cooling and Body-Warming Powders we mentioned earlier. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(27\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2827%29.png)

The Plantain Fan is also a good option, to remove the elements from him and knock him back while you follow up with your own attacks. It at least buys you some time to take down a chunk of his health without retaliation. 

It's still worth focusing on heavy attacks and increasing your Critical Hit chances to finish the fight quickly in this second phase. If you stick with using Wukong's armor and staff, your Critical Hit chance will increase with Spells, so it's worth unleashing them in this second phase – particularly as they'll also receive a reduced cooldown buff. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(28\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/21/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2828%29.png)

Around the halfway mark of this second phase, things get even more complicated. The Stone Monkey will reach for a hair and perform his own version of the Pluck of Many spell. He'll split in two, with two health bars appearing on screen. When this happens, you'll now experience both fire and ice at the same time, with each monkey alternating between the two elements. 

Thankfully, the attacks won't vary hugely here so you should be familiar with them at this stage. But you will need to keep shifting your attention between the two enemies as each one takes the lead. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(31\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2831%29.png)

Some more projectiles are brought into  here, however. Occasionally, one of the monkeys will pull up a large rock from the ground and throw it at you, or you'll see one prepare to throw an orb of ice followed by an orb of fire at you. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(30\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2830%29.png)

The final part of this move is typically an even larger orb of fire will be thrown your way. This will mean that you can't spend all your time as close to them as possible, and will need to dip back at times to easily avoid these attacks. 

At this stage, it's worth throwing out your spells like Pluck of Many to overwhelm the two enemies and using Immobilize to keep one in place, while you target the other. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(32\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/dd/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2832%29.png)

When the Stone Monkey's health bar has been depleted, he'll face off still against The Destined One. A cutscene will see the Destined One hold his own against the giant monkey, sending our duplicates to put an end to the creature. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(35\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cb/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2835%29.png)

As it staggers back and breaks down into stone, electricity will form around it and the Great Sage's Broken Shell will appear. Despite going straight into this fight from the Stone Monkey, all your Spells, Gourd uses, and health will be replenished.
