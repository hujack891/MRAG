## Where to Find Shigandang

It's possible to locate Shigandang without realizing what he is, as this boss is actually hiding in another Yaoguai King's arena. Travel through the Fright Cliff to Rockrest Flat, and enter the archway to the left to where the Vanguard of Stone") dwells. As you enter, you may notice a large rock that on closer inspection has many carved heads on it. To activate it, you'll need to seek out six statue heads around the Fright Cliff and retrieve their Buddha's Eyeballs: 

![Wukong Eye1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/28/Wukong_Eye1.jpg)

  * Upon first entering the Fright Cliff, travel up the sloping path, and you should spot the smoke trail of the Fright Cliff’s Shrine. Just before it, you can hear ominous chanting. The chanting comes from a large Buddha head statue in the ground, and by interacting with it, you can claim the Buddha’s Eyeball.

  * From the Squall Hideout Shrine, take the left path up to a darkened area leading into a large cave. Ignore the middle path leading into the main cave entrance for the moment, and head toward the large open cave area to the left by following some braziers. They’ll lead toward a large ominous statue in the dark. More Palestones will try to ambush you here, and they guard another stone statue head at the foot of the larger statue’s altar. Examine it to gain another Buddha’s Eyeball.

  * Return to the Squall Hideout Shrine, and instead stick to the far right side of the open valley and up to some ruins. Fight your way to the top of the stairs and keep staff spinning to deflect the ranged attacks until all the Blazebones are dead. At the end of this high raised wooden platform you’ll find another of the giant statue heads, allowing you to take its Buddhas Eyeball.

  * Located just across the crevice from the previous Buddha statue head, look for a pathway along a ridge left of the crevice to find a Buddha's Eyeball to claim here.

  * Between the Squall Hideout and Rockrest Flat Shrines, you can find a large cave and tunnel leading to the Mother of Stones Yaoguai Chief fight. Take a right when looking at the boss to find a cave exit onto a small raised platform, and you'll find a statue head here.

  * Finally, when resting at the Rockrest Flat Shrine, you need only advance forward toward the entrance to the Stone Vanguard / Shigandang Boss Fights to find the final statue and Buddha's Eyeball.

## Shigandang Boss Fight and Guide

Though they appear in the same arena, the Shigandang is a much harder challenge compared to the Stone Vanguard. Because of this, it’s recommended that you save challenging this foe until you’re almost complete with Chapter 2 and have a good set of gear and medicines at your disposal to increase damage negation. He’s worth defeating before you fight the final boss of this chapter, as you’ll be able to craft a new weapon upon his defeat. 

### Secret - Defeat the Stone Vanguard with the Shigandang

![Wukong Shigandang 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/eb/Wukong_Shigandang_1.jpg)  
If you find yourself having trouble with the Stone Vanguard, it is possible to get some assistance from the Shigandang in an unexpected way!

If you haven't yet defeated the Stone Vanguard on your own but have found all six Buddha Eyeballs, you can actually summon the Shigandang before engaging the Stone Vanguard. When summoned early, he will arise and immediately fight with the Stone Vanguard. The good news is he's a lot tougher than the Stone Vanguard, and will perform a flashy finisher to tear the other rock Guai to pieces, giving you all the rewards!  
Of course, after defeating the Stone Vanguard, the Shigandang will immediately turn on you, and might be too tough to fight early if you were having problems defeating the Vanguard on your own!

In some ways, the Shigandang will have some familiar moves to the Stone Vanguard, most notably the ability for certain stone attacks to glow before exploding and damaging anything nearby, so whenever you see a stone pillar shoot up and glow, that’s your cue to get away. 

![Wukong Shigandang 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/62/Wukong_Shigandang_3.jpg)

The Shigandang will often start the fight by racing toward you on all fours, slamming the ground with each step that can make it hard to avoid if you don’t have a head start on sprinting back or using Cloud Step to give him the slip. 

![Wukong Shigandang 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3b/Wukong_Shigandang_4.jpg)

When the boss leaps into the air, he’ll slam down on all fours again to send out a tremor, but will also cause a stone pillar to shoot up by whichever part of his body you're closest to. The pillar will glow (as will his front arms), and after a moment explode and deal damage, so keep strafing away to attack a different part of his body. 

When attacking him from the front, be ready to deal with backhanded sweeps along the ground that you can parry with Rock Solid, or dodge and keep your combo going. However, if he stands up and pulls one arm back, you can expect a surprisingly far-reaching and fast lunging punch, followed by a slam into the ground. 

Other times, he’ll lift off the ground a bit to slam one fist down, and detonate both with a small area of effect blast. This is a perfect attack to try retreating using the Thrust Stance and hitting him from a distance with a charged heavy attack while out of range of the blast.

However, if he performs a larger leap into the air, he can summon several rock pillars in front of him when he slams his fists into the ground, making a direct retreat backward inadvisable! The good news is this move will often require him to pull his arms out of the ground after detonating the pillars, giving you plenty of time to hit him with big attacks. 

![Wukong Shigandang 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/25/Wukong_Shigandang_5.jpg)

Be wary when trying to attack him from behind, as he’ll respond by doing a backward elbow drop into the ground, covering a wide area that will also cause spiky rocks to shoot up near the point of impact in a cone away from his body. 

![Wukong Shigandang 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c5/Wukong_Shigandang_11.jpg)

The Shigandang has a massive attack you’ll need to be on the lookout for. He’ll start by lifting an arm and a leg, before slamming down on all fours to create a massive shockwave covering a large portion of the arena. All four of his limbs will glow, and soon after will cause a massive detonation. It is possible to avoid this with a well timed pillar stance to gain height on your staff, but you’ll need to do it away from his body or the initial blast can still knock you down or damage you regardless. 

![Wukong Shigandang 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ab/Wukong_Shigandang_10.jpg)

Another deadly attack he can perform will have the Shigandang stand up on two legs and alternate two delayed punches into the ground in front of him. After this, he’ll slam both hands deep into the earth, and after a pause will rip them out, creating a line of exploding pillars in front of him you’ll want to steer clear of and attack his sides or back. 

![Wukong Shigandang 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e6/Wukong_Shigandang_12.jpg)

It’s not a bad idea to use the Azure Dust Transformation on him too, as your Rock Guai form can take the damage be dishes out and build up Might, and then perform a Rockfall attack to hit him for massive damage and stagger him. 

With a lot of health and defense, it will take some time to chip away at this massive stone monster, but if you can avoid or deflect his big attacks and conserve your gourd uses, you’ll be able to win this endurance battle. 

Defeating the Shigandang will earn you a Mind Core, 2 Yaoguai Core, 1371 Will, and a Heart of Stone material, allowing you to craft a new weapon, the Cloud-Patterned Stone Staff! You’ll also gain the Skandha of Feeling, which is the second mysterious Skandha Key Item you can find in the game after the Skandha of Form early in Chapter 1.
