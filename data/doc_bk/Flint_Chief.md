# Flint Chief

Flint Chief is a Yaoguai Chief you'll fight near the start of the Furnace Valley section of Chapter 5 in Black Myth: Wukong. This optional boss is easily missable but can be found tucked away in a lava stream as you head up to Rakshasha Palace. 

## How to Find Flint Chief

After entering the cave in Furnace Valley, head to the left. Continue following the path, through the archway, where you'll see another Flamling emerge on the right. Take the Flamling out and look down to the left, below the edge of the cliff where it sat.

Drop down here, and head right first to collect the Fire Date from the tree. Then go in the opposite direction toward the lava streaming from the ceiling. This is where you can find one of the optional bosses in Chapter 5, the Flint Chief.

The Flint Chief is another rock boss in the game, that will try to use all its might in its attacks, so the moveset will seem familiar.

A lot of the moves will see the Chief attack with long sweeps or hitting the ground with its fists. Ripples of lava will often follow these attacks, so using the Fireproof Mantle will give you some protection against the fire damage.

There are three areas you can concentrate attacks, which are its body and two hands. It's best to target the two hands, as these are actually breakable and by removing them, the Flint Chief becomes a lot more unsteady on its feet. Focus combos, follow-ups, and heavy attacks on its hands to remove them as quickly as possible.

When you've beaten it collect the Flint Chief Spirit it drops and the Fire Date from the tree to the right of the lava flowing from the ceiling.
