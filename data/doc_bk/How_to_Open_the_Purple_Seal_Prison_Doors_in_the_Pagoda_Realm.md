# How to Open the Purple Seal Prison Doors in the Pagoda Realm

In Chapter 3 of Black Myth: Wukong, you’ll awaken in a prison cell in the Pagoda Realm. A purple magic seal can be found on the next cell along, and as you explore the area, you’ll start to see more of them. With NPCs and items to find behind these locked doors, it’s worth spending the time finding how to unlock them. On this page, we’ll break down how to find the boss you need to get the item that will allow you to do so. 

## How to Remove the Purple Magic Seals on the Prison Cells in Chapter 3

When you first wake up in the jail cell in the Pagoda Realm of the New West region, there will be nowhere to go but outside to the long ledge that wraps around the huge room. Head left from the cell, and you’ll find another one next door to yours. This one has a **purple circle magic seal** on the outside, preventing you from getting into it. You will, however, find an NPC inside that you can speak to. 

With nothing else to do here for now, you’ll want to continue along the ledge (past the Lantern Wardens if the room is in its greyish haze) toward the first Keeper’s Shrine of the realm. Just before the shrine, you’ll see another one of the locked purple doors.

From the Keeper’s Shrine, go left and into the prison cell, so you can walk along the tunnel behind them. Follow this until you reach the end, where you’ll end up back outside and onto another part of the ledge. Follow it (heading past the Lantern Wardens again if there's a haze) to the opening on the left that will lead you to a set of stairs.

Go up the stairs and as you exit the cell, you’ll see that the path branches off to the left and right. Take the path on the right, going back on yourself, until you reach the wooden beam. Use this as a bride to reach the smaller ledge (watch out for the archer on the way).

Head through the passageway on the right, until you reach an enemy facing the wall near a slope that will take you up to the next level. Then proceed past the Red-Haired Yaksha to reach the next Keeper’s Shrine.

Opposite the Upper Pagoda Keeper’s Shrine, and past where you just walked, look down to see lots of stone figures. Carefully drop down onto the roof, then look for the lower roofs on the left to safely get to the bottom.

As soon as you approach the large figure, the boss fight against Captain Lotus-Vision will begin.

After defeating the Captain, you’ll be able to capture his Spirit, which will actually go into your inventory under Key Items. Now that you have the Spirit, the purple seals on the cells will automatically be unlocked.

To leave the area, go to the back of the room near the locked gates and take the slope up to the left. Drop down here and you’ll be back near the first beam you crossed over. 

Return to the Lower Pagoda Keeper's Shrine, and you can now make your way back to the prison cell that you first saw with the purple magic seal on it. Speak to the NPC inside, and collect the sword from the dead two-headed rat. This will reward you with the**Ashen Slumber spell.**
