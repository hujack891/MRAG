# Default Set

The Default set of Armor and Gear in Black Myth: Wukong consists of three pieces. It is basic, with no special stats or unique effects. The Default Set of Armor and Gear comes with: 

  * Tiger Hide Loincloth (body) - 5 Defense
  * Cotton Wriswraps (arms) - 2 Defense
  * Cotton Legwraps (legs) - 3 Defense

All of these pieces of armor are automatically equipped at the start of Chapter 1 - Black Wind Mountain. You can't find these items or get any enhanced versions of them, as they purely serve as some extra protection to get through the initial sections of the game.

Additionally, the Default Set of Armor and Gear can't be crafted, as it is the starting armor in the game.
