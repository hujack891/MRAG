# Red Loong

Red Loong is an optional secret Yaoguai King boss fight that you can encounter in Chapter 1 of Black Myth Wukong. Hidden away in the Forest of Wolves, you won't be able to encounter this boss until you obtain a Key Item later in the game, and this boss is and appropriate challenging fight far stronger than anything else in Black Wind Mountain. Red Loong is one of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials. 

  * **Rewards:** Boshan Censer, Thunder Tail, Loong Pearl x1, Mind Core x1, Silk x3, 1652 Experience, 1376 Will

## Where to Find Red Loong

While the Red Loong Dragon can be found in Chapter 1’s Black Wind Mountain, you will not be able to access and challenge this secret boss until at least Chapter 2, when you begin to explore the Yellow Wind Ridge.

Head through the Sandgate Village and defeat the King of Flowing Sand and his Second Rat Prince son. After defeating the pair (or only the son), head left from the boss arena and into the Valley of Despair.

Once you arrive in the large covered valley area, keep to the left to find a large lower platform by a slightly rounded red wall lined with small statues. At this point, if you did not kill the King of Flowing Sand, he’ll summon his other son, the First Rat Prince — otherwise you can use the Pungent Flesh Chunk to summon him yourself.

While fighting the First Rat Prince, you can lure him into performing one of his large slam attacks when facing the rounded wall, and it will cause a crack to appear in the wall. If you are unable to lure the boss into forming a crack in the wall, you can even do so yourself by hitting it with a very strong attack - we recommend the Wandering Wight’s Spirit Attack, or the Azure Dust Transformation Spell’s final attack.

You can enter the crack in the wall, and on the other side you’ll find a chest containing the Loong Scales. With this item, you’ll be able to uncover the lair of the Loong Dragons.

Return to the Forest of Wolves and head to the Outside the Forest Shrine. 

![Wukong RedLoong 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Wukong_RedLoong_5.jpg)

From here you’ll want to stay along the paths to the left to head up and then over to an area with a large waterfall and four statues. With the Loong Scales, you’ll hear a voice speak to you, which means you’re in the right spot. 

![Wukong RedLoong 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/86/Wukong_RedLoong_6.jpg)

You can now find a spot to interact with in front of the large waterfall, using the power of Loong Scales to evaporate the waterfall, and reveal a path to the Red Loong Dragon. 

## Yaoguai King Boss Battle - Red Loong

![Wukong RedLoong 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/66/Wukong_RedLoong_7.jpg)

The Red Loong is a fearsome red dragon imbued with the power of electricity, which is both his greatest strength and weakness once you know how to exploit it. It’s important to note that while you can face this boss once you find the required Key Item early in Chapter 2, you may want to wait until after completing Chapter 2, or even starting Chapter 3, due to the difficulty of this encounter. In particular, it’s a good idea to stock up on medicine to increase your shock resistance, and buy the Thunderbolt Horn Soak from the Shen Monkey as well. 

![Wukong RedLoong 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/51/Wukong_RedLoong_8.jpg)

Red Loong will use its electricity imbued attacks to wreak havoc on you, but can also perform a variety of powerful melee attacks. Be wary of his ability to fly over to you and slash at you as he pivots. 

![Wukong RedLoong 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/60/Wukong_RedLoong_11.jpg)

Other times, he’ll slam down his front claws in quick succession, creating lightning spots that will detonate in the area after a short moment, requiring you to quickly dodge away or risk taking major shock damage. Take too much, and you’ll be taking double damage until you use medication to remove the effect. 

![Wukong RedLoong 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/11/Wukong_RedLoong_10.jpg)

He also has a wicked and electrified bladed tail that he can use to quickly spin around and slash you with, but can be deflected with a well-timed Rock Solid spell. There’s a few different ways he can use his tail, either for a slow rotating blade slash in front of him, or with a quick jab at your position. 

![Wukong RedLoong 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b8/Wukong_RedLoong_15.jpg)

If you try to attack from behind, he can even leap up to face you while slashing his tail below him in a retreating strike to stop you from pursuing him. 

He can also use simple claw swipes, which more often than not will create more lightning spots that detonate after a short delay. Always dodge to the opposite side of his swipe so you can retaliate with attacks and not get shocked. 

Red Loong can also employ a deadly extended combo, first lunging at you with two claw swipes to create lightning spots, and then leaping into the air to feint around to the other side of you while swinging his tail below — all while finally landing behind you to attack as the lightning detonates on the other side. 

With enough sustained damage, you can eventually stagger and knock down the Red Loong, which is your big moment to maximize your damage output. 

![Wukong RedLoong 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f8/Wukong_RedLoong_13.jpg)

Look for the four electric pots that crackle and sparkle on the back of the dragon. You’ll want to aim a large heavy hit directly on these whenever possible. Targeting them isn’t always easy, as you can only really lock on to the center of his body, which may not specifically point you at the pots on his back. 

![Wukong RedLoong 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6a/Wukong_RedLoong_16.jpg)

For your best chance, we recommend swapping to the Pillar Stance, and unleashing a big charge attack when facing his back. With 2-3 Focus Points banked, you have a good chance of slamming your staff down right on his back and hitting one or more pots. Should you connect, you’ll deal a huge amount of damage to Red Loong in a single burst, causing an explosion in the process. 

![Wukong RedLoong 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/ff/Wukong_RedLoong_14.jpg)

Be wary though, if you are unable to cause this big damage hit, Red Loong will awaken and trigger his own electric explosion as he rises, and you’ll want to retreat well away before this happens. 

Unfortunately, there’s other times when he can detonate a similar explosion even when not getting back from a stun, and it’s hard to tell when this will happen, other than him remaining still and charging the pots on his back for a long moment. 

The rest of this fight will rely on your ability to stagger him back into this state, and maximize the damage to the pots on his back. Make use of Spirits with big hits like the Wandering Wight, and the Azure Dust Transformation spell to score big hits that knock him back, and you’ll have a better chance of stunning him again. 

![Wukong RedLoong 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ea/Wukong_RedLoong_17.jpg)

If you find yourself struggling to hit the pots, make sure you attack him when he’s stunned where his back is facing, and not his belly, as you’ll get a better angle that way. You can also quickly take a Tiger Subduing Pellet right when he becomes stunned to maximize your damage output on his weak point. 

![Wukong RedLoong 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e7/Wukong_RedLoong_18.jpg)

When the Red Loong finally falls as you explode his pots for good, you’ll earn plenty of rewards, including a Loong Pearl, Mind Core, 3 Silk, 1376 Will, and 1652 Experience. In addition to this, you can find a gold chest nearby that contains a Boshan Censer curio, and a Thunder Tail weapon material — one of two Loong materials needed to craft the Loongwreathe Staff!
