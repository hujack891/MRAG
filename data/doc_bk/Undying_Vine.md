# Undying Vine

The Undying Vine is one of the Rare Soaks for your Gourds in Black Myth: Wukong. The Soak's ability is incredibly strong, making it one of the better options to choose. 

With the Undying Vine Soak equipped, using the gourd instantly recovers a great amount of stamina and increases stamina recovery rate for a short duration. 

Soaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Undying Vine Location

The Undying Vine Soak can be found in The Webbed Hollow, randomly dropped from Lushleaf enemies. Simply farm them around Purple Cloud Mountain until the Soak drops. You can find a video guide on how to get to Purple Cloud Mountain, the chapter's secret area, below:

Soaks are far more plentiful than the drinks for your gourds. They are scattered throughout the game, across each chapter.

You can also keep track of the Awaken Wine Worm locations and Luoija Fragrant Vine locations, which are key to upgrading your healing potential and Gourd.
