# Best Spirits to Use

Picking the right Spirit to use in your loadout for Black Myth: Wukong can be as important as Weapons and Armor. After unlocking the Gourd in Chapter 1, you can start to capture the spirits of enemies and use them in battle. But if you're searching for tips on what the best spirits to use are, here's what we'd recommend.

## Best Spirits to Use in Black Myth: Wukong

When you use a Spirit, you will temporarily transform into them and be able to perform their special move. Alongside these skills, each Spirit provides a boost to a general stat or status effect, such as an increase in Poison damage or an increase in Defense when performing a particular move like Rock Solid. 

Unlike Transformations, you will share the same health bar with Spirits, so it's crucial to pull them out at the right time. Not sure which Spirits to equip? Here are some we consider to be the best spirits to use in Black Myth: Wukong. 

Wandering Wight| Guangmou| Tiger's Acolyte  
---|---|---  
Blade Monk| Non-White| Falcon Hermit  
Clay Vajra| Flint Vanguard| Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang (Upgraded)  
  
Remember that Spirits can be upgraded! At any Keeper's Shrine, you can choose to Cultivate Spirits from the Self-Advance menu. This will allow you to upgrade your Spirits using a combination of Will and items like Blood of the Iron Bull and Tadpoles. If you like a Spirit, cultivate them so you can max out their buffs. 

### Wandering Wight

This Spirit is entirely missable if you get to the end of Chapter 1 without picking it up, but you'll also likely encounter it before you've got your Gourd. Thankfully, you can pick it up from the nearest Keeper's Shrine once you've got the Gourd, and we'd recommend you do so because it's a great one to have equipped especially in the early game. 

The Wandering Wight provides a substantial buff to your defence, which can make all the difference in fights. Not only this, but its Faithful Kowtow special attack allows you to deal a chunk of damage by smashing the giant's head into an enemy. 

### Guangmou

This is another Spirit you can collect from Chapter 1, and with it, you can use the Veiled Vipers special attack. When you perform this, four snakes will appear to help you out, dealing poison damage to enemies. 

You'll gain a moderate increase in the poison damage you deal, and have the added bonus of poison resistance alongside it. Even if you're not going up against too many enemies that use poison attacks, you will find plenty are susceptible to poison damage and the status will build up letting you chip away at an enemy's health bar while you use other moves. 

### Gore-Eye Daoist

If you want to make the most of the spells you can cast, the Gore-Eye Daoist moderately buffs your Maximum Mana levels. To complement the equipped effect, his Raging Blood attack sees him create an area that will enhance your attacks along as you stay inside the glow. 

### Tiger's Acolyte

![Best Spirits \(3\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/07/Best_Spirits_%283%29.png)

It's a fairly simple attack that the Tiger's Acolyte offers, but Sharp Edge is a quick hack-and-slash move that can deal a chunk of damage. In addition to the move, you'll also gain a moderate increase in Critical Damage, so using it at the right time can be a powerful attack. As another added bonus, the Qi cost of using Tiger's Acolyte is moderate, while most others are high. 

### Blade Monk

![Best Spirits \(1\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a3/Best_Spirits_%281%29.png)

The Slaughter attack the Blade Monk can pull out allows you to swing a huge greatsword twice and then smash it down on a foe. You'll also get a moderate attack buff as soon as you've taken down an enemy. 

### Non-White

![Best Spirits \(5\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/25/Best_Spirits_%285%29.png)

Non-White's Bone Spikes attack allows him to leap forward and spin at the same time, getting close to targets quickly and hitting them. The immediate follow-up to this is he'll sprout thorns to stab an enemy, prolonging the attack. In the same way that Gangmou is useful for Poison Damage, so is the Non-White Spirit. Alongside the moderate buff to Poison Damage, you'll also get a moderate increase to Frost Damage, so aim for a two-pronged attack that allows you to inflict both elements. 

### Falcon Hermit

The Falcon Hermit Spirit uses Frosty Wind, which is another way you can freeze enemies in place. Frosty Wind appears like a tornado, moving around and battering enemies that stand in its way. It's great for crowd control and offers the chance to freeze enemies in place, so you can follow up quickly with your own attacks. 

### Clay Vajra

![Best Spirits \(4\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fd/Best_Spirits_%284%29.png)

If you've got to Chapter 3 and encountered a Clay Vajra, you'll know they're a walking fire machine, and who wouldn't want to use that as an attack? Flames of Doom will see the Clay Vajra shoot fire from its knees in a wide arc, meaning you can deal with groups or cover a large area when attacking. The buff you'll receive for having this Spirit equipped is burn resistance, so it's also great to use against enemies that deliver fire attacks themselves. 

### Flint Vanguard

The Flint Vanguard, which you can acquire in Chapter 5 packs a real punch in fights. Firstly, its Flaming Flint attack sees it continuously pummel the ground and enemies directly in front of it. This in itself deals quite a bit of damage, but as it attacks, it also builds Scorch Bane. If you can land enough attacks on an enemy, it will be inflicted with Burn Damage, helping you hugely by inflicting status damage for a short period of time while you continue to attack. 

### Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang/Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang

Though this definitely doesn't start as the best spirit in the game as Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, if you find and defeat all 6 frog bosses, you can upgrade this spirit to Mythical level where it becomes Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang. When it reaches Mythical status, you essentially have a frog randomizer that deals elemental damage. Tongue Whip becomes an attack, where a different version of the frog bosses will appear, allowing you to inflict Lightning, Ice, Poison, or Fire. The last option is a Stone frog, that will howl and roar.
