# Bitter Lake Walkthrough

The Bitter Lake is the third main region of Chapter 3 in The New West in Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide for the Bitter Lake Region, including how to defeat Kang-Jin Star and the Cyan Loong on Turtle Island, and how to navigate the North Shore to unlock the Zodiac Village and defeat the Apramana Bat -- plus where to find the four Buddha Statues. 

  *     * Yaoguai King - Kang-Jin Star
  * **Turtle Island**
    * Yaoguai King - Cyan Loong
  * **North Shore of the Bitter Lake**
    * Boss Fight - Chen Loong
    * Yaoguai Chief - Apramana Bat
  * **Precept Corridor**

Leaving the Warding Temple where you learned the Ring of Fire Spell from the Ancient Master, you'll have to slide down a long slope to reach a mountaintop where a giant pair of cymbals have been wedged into a mountain peak. 

![Wukong Turtle 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d3/Wukong_Turtle_1.jpg)

As you draw close, you'll hear a voice coming from the cymbals, who is arguing with a woman refusing to let the trapped person out. With a loud gong, the trapped "Admiral" will use the cymbal to awaken a giant turtle whose mountainous shell you're actually standing on. 

As the turtle begins to swim through the Bitter Seal, the woman will become aware of your presence, starting this new region off with a bang of a boss fight. 

## Yoaguai King Boss Fight - Kang-Jin Star

Like the other Kang-Jin, expect this fight to involve a heaping helping of electricity, and stock up accordingly on Shock-Quelling medicine, or you'll be taking a lot of damage. Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead. 

![Wukong Turtle 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/29/Wukong_Turtle_2.jpg)

When the battle starts, Kang-Jin Star will often summon small serpent-like electric projectiles to swim around her in the air before sending them your way. Watch her movement to see when she directs them so you'll know when to dodge their quick movement. 

This boss doesn't move all that much, though she can teleport, meaning you'll be able to close the distance quite fast, but Kang-Jin Star will use a lot of spells to keep you at arms length. 

![Wukong Turtle 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c4/Wukong_Turtle_3.jpg)

Often after proclaiming "Tremors forge thunder" she can create electrical spots on the ground to erupt with lightning after a moment. The problem is these rings will follow you for a moment before she enacts the strike, so again you'll need to watch when she crackles with light to know the strike is coming and dodge it. At the start of the fight you'll only have to dodge one, but over time she'll do more and more of these for the first part of her attack. 

She'll often follow up these strikes by finishing her sentence with "clashes form bolts" and then toss a projectile straight at you from her hand, requiring a second dodge before can get close and retaliate. 

![Wukong Turtle 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4c/Wukong_Turtle_4.jpg)

Even when you get in close range to fight, she has a few close-range lightning attacks to deal with. One starts with another mantra "Spin..." causing her to slash at you with lightning sweeps in two quick attacks, before performing a third attack while yelling "and flush!" This third attack can take the form of a floating downward slash, or creating a cross slash in front of her that moves outward. Whichever it is, a Cloud Step can let you bypass her attack by dodging to the side and then hit her from the flank. 

![Wukong Turtle 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f7/Wukong_Turtle_5.jpg)

Other times, watch her hand movements when attacking up close -- if she waves them around with electric energy before holding them at her side, be ready for an extremely quick lightning burst she'll slam down in front of her to block your advance. 

![Wukong Turtle 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5c/Wukong_Turtle_6.jpg)

After taking a bit of damage, she can teleport away to appear high up in the air. Often times, this will start by turning into a larger electrical dragon resembling Kang-Jin Loong. 

When she's far away, she'll roar to create a lightning storm of sorts, causing large spear-like projectiles to hit the ground with an electric explosion, and only a moment's warning for where they'll strike. 

![Wukong Turtle 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e9/Wukong_Turtle_7.jpg)

Later on, Kang-Jin Star will appear much closer above you in her dragon form, and use a familiar tail slam to explode the ground around you. Luckily, not only can you dodge or deflect this, but you can then strafe to the right to attack the dragon's head before she transforms back. 

![Wukong Turtle 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f1/Wukong_Turtle_8.jpg)

Another terrifying attack she can commence when you're at close range comes when she proclaims "Yield... to your true self!". Floating in the air, she'll create a large electric dome around her that continues to expand, meaning you'll want to break off the attack and retreat to a safe distance. 

Note that the field will also generate an electric ring along the ground to reach even farther that you'll need to jump or pillar stance over - but it also only moves along a flat horizontal axis, and standing on rocks or slope can often cause it to go under you. 

![Wukong Turtle 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/dd/Wukong_Turtle_9.jpg)

When appearing to float up above you, watch carefully if she summons an electrical imbued spike in her hand. She'll fly down close to throw it at the ground, and even if you dodge you'll need to watch for when it creates a tremor to explode the ground around it. 

![Wukong Turtle 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/dd/Wukong_Turtle_10.jpg)

At around half health, she'll start to get madder, and teleport high up to summon several groups of electrical bolts that will fly out in small clusters to track you down. You can't deflect them with your staff, so either use Cloud Step or stick to dodging. 

After this, she'll trigger a thunderstorm that darkens the arena, filling you the area with static electricity and most likely giving you the Shocked status effect. Take a moment to use a Shock-Quelling medicine. 

![Wukong Turtle 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2f/Wukong_Turtle_11.jpg)

Right after she inflicts you with Shock, she'll trigger an even bigger lightning storm to try and maximize her damage against you, which is another good time to make yourself scarce with Cloud Step, and otherwise keep running around to avoid the attacks. 

![Wukong Turtle 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cd/Wukong_Turtle_12.jpg)

Expect her to get more aggressive in this second half, expelling more lightning at the end of some of her close-combat attacks that require more dodging and less room for counters. You can still use Immobilize to keep her from floating away, however. 

![Wukong Turtle 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/78/Wukong_Turtle_13.jpg)

Another move she can now perform in her enhanced state is to expel a bunch of those serpent-like electric projectiles straight up from her body, which will twist in the air before coming back down to track you, and will require you taking some evasive action. 

![Wukong Turtle 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/da/Wukong_Turtle_14.jpg)

Finally (and possibly most terrifyingly), she can hover high into the air and create a giant group of her electrified spears all around her, sending volleys of them outward in several directions to track you down. Try not to panic, and use Cloud Step to give her the slip, or keep strafing and dodging as much as you can. 

![Wukong Turtle 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/39/Wukong_Turtle_15.jpg)

After the spears have been thrown out from around her, she'll summon one last giant spear in her hand, and leap down towards you to pierce you with it. 

![Wukong Turtle 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9c/Wukong_Turtle_16.jpg)

Quickly dodge to the side, and keep your distance as the embedded spear will explode after a short moment, sending rocks up all around it. 

![Wukong Turtle 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a6/Wukong_Turtle_17.jpg)

The good news is this attack is so powerful it will leave her incredibly drained, and give you plenty of time to retaliate with all your saved up focus points, a Spirit Attack, and anything else you can throw at her! 

![Wukong Turtle 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/70/Wukong_Turtle_18.jpg)

As long as your patient to wait for the right moments to get in close and attack, and make sure you're using shock-quelling medicine, you'll be able to come out on top. Even as Kang-Jin Star tries to flee in her dragon form, the Destined One will see to it that she crashes into the large cymbals, freeing the prisoner inside! 

Kang-Jing Star

This imprisoned Pig Guai is none other than Zhu Bajie, who traveled with Sun Wukong during his adventures in Journey to the West! 

## Turtle Island

Now free of the cymbals that once trapped Sun Wukong himself, Zhu Bajie may appear grumpy, but he's willing to help the Destined One on his journey. He'll run off to the front of the Turtle Island where the giant beast's head is, and you can follow him to get the main story moving to the rest of the Bitter Lake area, but there's a few things worth checking out here first. 

Back at the Turtle Island Shrine below where you faced Kang-Jin Star, be sure to explore the left side of the "island" (when facing up toward the turtle's head). 

![Wukong Turtle 19X.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f5/Wukong_Turtle_19X.jpg)

There's many ledges along this ridge you can explore. Many of them have a couple of Frozen Corpses lying in wait, but be on the lookout for a small altar with a gold pot on dis. You can open it and find another **Celestial Jade Lotus Pill** to increase your maximum health. 

The New West Celestial Jade Lotus Pill

![Wukong Turtle 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/39/Wukong_Turtle_20.jpg)

Drop down even further to lower ledges along this left side, and you can find a narrow ledge leading through a tiny tunnel over to where a **Treasure Chest** can be looted for materials. 

![Wukong Turtle 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f9/Wukong_Turtle_21.jpg)

Head past the chest to find another trail leading past it, and watch for two Cyan Bats in another small tunnel with a green Wisp, leading to a Tree Pearl to harvest. 

![Wukong Turtle 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8b/Wukong_Turtle_22.jpg)

Look for ledges to jump up past the Tree Pearl, and you'll find another section ending in some braziers beside a second **Treasure Chest** with more materials. 

![Wukong Turtle 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f1/Wukong_Turtle_23.jpg)

Most of the opposite side of the turtle boasts more criss-crossing ledge paths with Frozen Corpses or Golden Lotus Guai, and a few green Wisps stashed away in corners you can absorb, but not much more than that. 

The biggest secret lies directly to the right of the Turtle Island Shrine when facing toward the front, but it will require you to have obtained the Loong Scales back in Chapter 2 behind a wall you can crack where the First Prince of Flowing Sands is summoned. 

![Wukong Turtle 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/12/Wukong_Turtle_24.jpg)

As you start exploring the path over to the right, an echoing voice will lead you to a large open platform where dragon humanoid figure appears to be frozen in place with its fishing rod. If you interact with it while holding the Loong Scales, it will crackle to life, and begin a new secret boss fight. 

## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Cyan Loong

While the Cyan Loong is a bit smaller than Black Loong, he is much more ferocious, and can use his lightning powers to quickly deal double damage and tear you to pieces -- especially if you choose to face him after arriving on Turtle Island. You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive. You should also have the Loongwreathe or Kang-Jin Staff, and have a good set of spells equipped that compliment your attacks -- we reccomend Immobilize and Rock Solid, but you can also try using the Ring of Fire to buff yourself up in since the arena is small. 

The Cyan Loong doesn't have a huge amount of attacks, but when they hit, they hit hard! 

![Wukong Turtle 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0d/Wukong_Turtle_25.jpg)

One of his most common attacks will have him briefly swim toward you before diving in to perform two standing sword slashes in quick succession. He'll follow up by floating high and charging up lightning in his hand to strike the ground in front of him, requiring you to dodge both the attack and the resulting strike that appears at the point he touches. 

![Wukong Turtle 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ef/Wukong_Turtle_26.jpg)

Expect him to also utilize his sword slashes in simple 1 or 2 hit attacks, or use his lightning palm attack on its own. His sword swings aren't too fast, but they can blindside you if you aren't ready to break off your attacks or use up all your stamina. 

![Wukong Turtle 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7f/Wukong_Turtle_29.jpg)

Another dangerous attack he can launch with little warning only comes with a small tell -- when he quickly swaps his sword to hold in a reverse grip behind his back. He'll then quickly launch himself through the air at you with a spinning slash that can take a chunk off your health, and then dive back to your position after a moment for sword slice when he reaches the ground. 

![Wukong Turtle 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ad/Wukong_Turtle_30.jpg)

The good news is his final sword slice allows for an extended moment to dodge around and attack him from behind. However, you'll need to keep your eyes open when trying to attack from behind, as he can easily whip his mace-like tail around to hit you. Watch for it to rise up to the top left before slashing down to the bottom right to know when to deflect or evade. 

![Wukong Turtle 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b5/Wukong_Turtle_27.jpg)

In addition to his standard sword swings and combos, the Cyan Loong can change things up by charging up and holding his sword back pointed straight at you before launching into a slow two-handed swing, or pausing to spin for a backhand slash as he whirls around. 

![Wukong Turtle 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f3/Wukong_Turtle_31.jpg)

The good news is with his form only slightly bigger than yours, the Cyan Loong is fairly susceptible to being staggered. Even a full Light Combo can send him stumbling backward, which you can mix in with a varied combo and follow up from the Smash Stance, stagger his sword swings with Rock Solid, and use a bulky Spirit attack like the Second Rat Prince to send him sprawling again and again and limit his ability to attack back. 

![Wukong Turtle 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bf/Wukong_Turtle_32.jpg)

However, once you manage to get his health down to around half, he'll imbue his sword with electricity in drawn out flourish, ending with him stabbing the sword into the ground to send up electric blasts all around him. You can try poking him from a distance with the Thrust Stance but be wary not to get too close. 

![Wukong Turtle 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5d/Wukong_Turtle_33.jpg)

With his freshly empowered sword, Cyan Loong will deal more damage than ever before. A single sword swing can cleave your health apart, and if you already have the shock status effect, you can easily die in a single hit if you aren't careful. Be sure to counter this new phase with Evil Repelling Medicament to increase your defense, and have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand for any moment you do get the status effect. 

![Wukong Turtle 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9d/Wukong_Turtle_35.jpg)

Several of his moves have also been improved. His electric palm strike for instance now causes several lightning strikes in front of him, up from just a single blast, requiring you to dodge around to his sides instead of backward. 

If he begins to hold his sword back while pointing at you, the air will crackle around him preventing you from getting close, and his two-handed sword swing will also unleash an electric projectile slash you'll need to evade. 

![Wukong Turtle 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/31/Wukong_Turtle_36.jpg)

The good news is that his blade won't stay enchanted forever, often ending with the previously mentioned attack. Once you no longer see electricity crackling along his blade, that's your cue to go back to pressing the attack by getting in staggering blows. 

![Wukong Turtle 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/75/Wukong_Turtle_34.jpg)

In particular, we recommend the Red Tides transformation spell to evade around his attacks while burning him, as he swings are slow enough that you can have an easier time performing the wolf guai's ultimate spell attack for big damage. 

This fight will largely come down to learning his moves enough that you can anticipate and avoid his powerful attacks, and find your opening to keep him staggered and on the defensive. Once you learn how to keep away from his sword swings, you'll be able to take him down for good. 

![Wukong Turtle 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/94/Wukong_Turtle_37.jpg)

When he falls, you'll earn some Fine Gold Thread and another Loong Pearl, and can loot a nearby chest that appears for the Mountain-Shaking Claw material and Breath of Fire Soak for your Gourd. This new material will unlock the upgrade path for your Loongwreathe Staff into the Golden Loong Staff, but you'll need to find and defeat the last of the four Loongs to craft it. 

Cyan Loong

Once you've had your fill of exploring the "Turtle Island", you can head to the front where the small Pig Guai stands waiting, and interact with him for the turtle to finally make its landing at the next part of the Bitter Lake. 

## North Shore of the Bitter Lake

![Wukong Bitter 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b8/Wukong_Bitter_1.jpg)

Once you and Zhu Bajie drop down onto the shore of the lake, you'll find there are a couple different directions you can go in. Just ahead on the right you'll find the North Shore Shrine, with the shore extending in both directions for optional areas to explore with bosses. However, if you want to hurry ahead, you can also look for a frozen tunnel a little ways to the right and proceed in toward the Precept Corridor. 

Since there's a good deal of important optional stuff (including some that can be missed if you proceed too far!) we'll start off checking the left side of the shore when facing the away from the water. 

![Wukong Bitter 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/05/Wukong_Bitter_2.jpg)

The good news is Zhu Bajie has now agreed to accompany you, and despite his size, the little pig is a handy follower to have. Not only is he pretty adept with his rake weapon, and can also belch poison at enemies, he can also expel a healing mist to help you recover your health and save on using your gourd! 

![Wukong Bitter 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/09/Wukong_Bitter_3.jpg)

Start by heading along the shore and defeating various Frozen Corpses, and look for a small building in the distance by the water's edge. As you near it, you can also spot a dragon man standing alone in the shallows. Zhu Bajie seems to know him, but as you approach, you'll be pulled into another boss fight. 

## Boss Fight - Chen Loong

Like the other Loongs in The New West, Chen favors using lightning magic, and is a much more caster-oriented opponent compared to the others. You can prepare to mitigate his attacks by making sure you've crafted the Loongscale Armor Set, are stocked up on Shock-Quelling Powder, and apply the Soak to your Gourd that increases shock resistance. 

While he's nowhere as strong as the other dragons you've faced, you don't want to get to cocky, or you may find his electric attacks peeling off more of your health than you can restore, even with Zhu Bajie helping out. 

![Wukong Bitter 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f2/Wukong_Bitter_14.jpg)

The old dragon can be pretty agile too, leaping away to float in the air before casting a variety of electric attacks. One of these includes sending out a flurry of small electric orbs at you, though they can be deflected with a quick staff spin. 

![Wukong Bitter 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/19/Wukong_Bitter_4.jpg)

He can also raise his hand up slowly to trigger a row of lightning bolts in the area, which will explode fairly fast. 

![Wukong Bitter 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/20/Wukong_Bitter_8.jpg)

Sometimes, he'll take to the air instead, and fly at you in a divebomb attack which will require you to dodge both the fly-by, and the resulting row of lightning strikes that follow his attack. 

![Wukong Bitter 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/43/Wukong_Bitter_5.jpg)

Another electric variation will have him performing an underhanded toss of anywhere between one and three small lightning orbs. They'll bounce along the water for a few hops, and then explode in a much wider area to damage you unless you can dodge to the side. 

![Wukong Bitter 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4b/Wukong_Bitter_13.jpg)

He can also shoot lightning directly out of his mouth in a beam of energy. This can happen both when he's on the ground in a quick straight burst right in front of him, or when floating above you in a quick sweep in front of him, and both need quick dodges to stop a quick attack. 

![Wukong Bitter 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7e/Wukong_Bitter_7.jpg)

While Chen Loong is highly susceptible to being staggered, he has a few tricks to stop you from pressing the attack for too long. His tail can be pretty impressive, and will use it to spin around and attack with it for two rotations, and then leap into the air to perform a delayed third electric slash. 

![Wukong Bitter 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0d/Wukong_Bitter_6.jpg)

He'll often vary this combo up making it hard to read, and either trick you into thinking he's preparing a cast before tail-whipping, or throwing more quick slashes in-between tail attacks -- or even just doing single hits. 

![Wukong Bitter 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7a/Wukong_Bitter_9.jpg)

The dragon won't just stop at wacking you with his tail up close, either. If he proclaims "To the deepest trench I dive!" Be ready for him to stick his tail in the ground, only for several giant electrified tails to sprout up in a cluster nearby. You'll need to quickly break off your attack and give them a wide berth, as they'll quickly perform a single huge spin attack all at once! 

![Wukong Bitter 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2e/Wukong_Bitter_10.jpg)

Other times, he may only summon one smaller tail, but this one can expel its electrical energy in a projectile blast when the tail swings. 

![Wukong Bitter 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b5/Wukong_Bitter_11.jpg)

His strongest attack by far is when he jumps into the air with his green weapon, charging it with energy before crashing down with it. It will cause a huge electrical explosion when he lands, but then spread outward with several lighting strikes that cover a wide area. 

![Wukong Bitter 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fc/Wukong_Bitter_16.jpg)

The second hit can be extremely tough to dodge, but using the Pillar Stance to get off the ground can soak the blow if you have stamina to spare (though it will probably still stun you). 

Remember that you also have Zhu Bajie as an ally in this fight, and while he won't be able to hold his attention for too long, but he can be useful at giving you some breathing room or interrupting attacks. 

![Wukong Bitter 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/40/Wukong_Bitter_12.jpg)

Since Chen Loong doesn't have a whole lot of health or armor, use everything in your arsenal to keep him staggered and unable to hit back whenever possible, and you can rush him down before the fight goes on too long and you start taking double damage too often. 

When he's defeated, Chen Loong will throw a bit of a tantrum, and you'll find he's not such a bad guy. He also seems to know Xu Dog, and claims only one of his celestial resurrection pills can ease his pains. 

Chen Loong

![Wukong Bitter 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d5/Wukong_Bitter_17.jpg)

Be sure to look on the docks near the small shack by the water to find a **Treasure Chest** for the Blood of the Iron Bull and some materials, and then warp back to the Yellow Wind Ridge to find the Xu Dog back in the cellar below the Crouching Tiger Temple. 

![Wukong Bitter 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d9/Wukong_Bitter_19.jpg)

Speak to him here, and he'll pass along a Special-made Bone-Strengthening Pellet for the poor old Loong. You'll also get the formula to make your own Fortifying Medicament for your trouble! 

![Wukong Bitter 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5c/Wukong_Bitter_20.jpg)

Return to Chen Loong (who now stands outside the shack by the water), and deliver the pellet to him. The old dragon will be overjoyed at your gift, and in return will pass along The Ruyi Scroll to you. He'll proclaim that he now has the strength to unseal the Painted Realm, where he and his fellow deities will now reside -- and you're invited! 

### The Zodiac Village of the Painted Realm

![Wukong Bitter 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/22/Wukong_Bitter_21.jpg)  
Consider the Zodiac Village in the Painted Realm your new hub area, a home away from home. Chen Loong has invited his fellow Zodiac Deities to stay here, which include the Xu Dog and Shen Monkey who you've already met. This means you now have a quick hub area to warp to as needed to trade in your Mind Cores, and upgrade your Gourds.   
In addition to this, Chen Loong himself will accept any seeds you may have randomly looted when harvesting plants, which will create more materials to freely harvest over time.  
![Wukong Bitter 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/66/Wukong_Bitter_22.jpg)

Finally, the fourth Zodiac Deity can be found nearby along a path - the Ying Tiger. He's a formidable blacksmith who you can interact with to finally upgrade your armor, allowing you to raise the armor ratings of sets you've found previously but became outdated. He also sells unlimited quantities of lower materials if you need to quickly craft or upgrade older gear.  
You can even choose to challenge the Yin Tiger to a duel, but be warned, he is incredibly deadly, and likely way beyond your current level. However, if you manage to defeat him, expect to unlock a new Transformation Spell and blueprint for a new armor set! 

![Wukong Bitter 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9a/Wukong_Bitter_18.jpg)

From the shack where Chen Loong was before entering the Painted Realm, you'll spot a nearby archway and a path leading up through some woods. 

![Wukong Bitter 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d5/Wukong_Bitter_23.jpg)

As you draw near another small building, you can spot a man in trouble, being harassed by three yaoguai. These lesser Apramana Bats can be a pain to deal with, as they'll routinely take to the air to slash at you with waves of force from a distance. 

![Wukong Bitter 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/62/Wukong_Bitter_25.jpg)

Wait for them to pull their legs up before smashing down to deflect with Rock Solid or dodge and counter with Cloud Step. 

![Wukong Bitter 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f4/Wukong_Bitter_26.jpg)

Once they've been defeated, you can approach the lone man. Zhu Bajie warns you to beware of him, but he seems harmless enough, and tells you he's in search of treasure, and promises to share it when he finds it -- though he'll likely get in trouble again before this is all through. 

He'll mention part of the treasure's riddle - green without, and red within: a summer treat. Sounds tasty, so be sure to keep an eye out for something matching that description. 

![Wukong Bitter 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/28/Wukong_Bitter_27.jpg)

Before heading back to the North Shore Shrine, be sure to check the large pool of water to the left of the treasure hunter. There's a **Treasure Chest** at the foot of the pool that holds various materials, and at the far end, you can find a small rock with a Gourd Drink placed upon it: **Bluebridge Romance**! 

![Wukong Bitter 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b3/Wukong_Bitter_28.jpg)

While it can't be upgraded from its base of 36% health restored, it not only increases your movement speed after drinking, but can hold up to three different Soaks, making it an incredibly versatile Gourd Drink to equip for boss fights! 

![Wukong Bitter 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/40/Wukong_Bitter_29.jpg)

From the North Shore Shrine, keep to the right this time and head along the lakeshore until you round a bend to find what looks to be giant skeletal remains strewn around the beach. 

![Wukong Bitter 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a8/Wukong_Bitter_30.jpg)

Up ahead, you'll spot another of the lesser Apramana Bats skulking about a curved skeletal piece, and nestled within is a **Treasure Chest** that holds some materials. 

![Wukong Bitter 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/77/Wukong_Bitter_31.jpg)

Another bat is hiding up ahead on the left in front of a Celestial Pear Tree, but with its back turned you can sneak up and unleash a charged strike first -- so long as you watch out for the Frozen Corpses around it. 

![Wukong Bitter 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a4/Wukong_Bitter_32.jpg)

Past a third bat facing a Frozen Corpse censor holder, you'll see the main skeletal remains of the once great Snake General: friend to Turtle General, who was apparently tortured and killed by Yellowbrow. 

![Wukong Bitter 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/52/Wukong_Bitter_33.jpg)

As you head close to inspect the skull of the great snake, a Yaoguai Chief will fly down to intercept you: a much bigger version of the bats you've faced recently! 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Apramana Bat

The Apramana Bat is a larger gold variant of the lesser Apramana Bats you've encountered, and while some moves will be similar, this boss can dish out damage quickly while remaining frustratingly out of reach. Still, when it does get close enough to strike, a well-timed Rock Solid deflection can send it crashing to the ground, and is useful to have for this fight. It can also use frozen winds to deal chilling attacks you should be ready for, so have warming medicine on hand or consider equipping a Curio that reduces frostbite, and consider trying the Ring of Fire to warm yourself up. 

![Wukong Bitter 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/29/Wukong_Bitter_34.jpg)

When on the ground, the Apramana Bat can slam its wings down, and create a huge gust of cold air that will billow out for an extended period. Evade this by dodging and sprinting to the side so you can perform a flank attack. 

![Wukong Bitter 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/85/Wukong_Bitter_40.jpg)

It can also charge up its wings by twisting its body, and will launch into two or three spin attacks by waving its wings around in a vortex as it flies at you several times. 

![Wukong Bitter 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e9/Wukong_Bitter_37.jpg)

Once it's tired of staying on the ground, it will often spread its wings wide to create another gust of freezing wind in a huge radius as it propels itself back into the air, where it can perform a number of attacks. 

![Wukong Bitter 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b2/Wukong_Bitter_38.jpg)

It's most common attack in the air is spreading its wings wide before beating them together, creating a cross slash projectile down at your location that requires some quick dodging. 

![Wukong Bitter 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/13/Wukong_Bitter_35.jpg)

If you see its legs extend upwards (similar to the lesser variants) it's preparing to slam down its talons on you in a quick downward slam. However, deflecting with Rock Solid will send it flying backward, only to topple out of the sky and provide you a moment to sprint over and retaliate. 

![Wukong Bitter 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/53/Wukong_Bitter_42.jpg)

If you aren't getting enough time in, consider using Immobilize to keep him grounded, and use the Pillar Stance to extend your height as it tries to take off. 

![Wukong Bitter 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0b/Wukong_Bitter_41.jpg)

Once you've gotten it on the ground for an extended period to dish out damage, be mindful not to get overconfident. If you see it hunch over and turn completely gold, it will use its own rock solid deflection to make your attack bounce off. 

Listen for the sound cue of your attack being deflected, and it will quickly rise up and extend a bladed wing up in the air before slamming it down on you. You can turn the tables with your own deflection (though it will send you sliding back), or dodge to the side and bash it with a Spirit Attack. 

![Wukong Bitter 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f7/Wukong_Bitter_39.jpg)

Zhu Bajie can be a big boon for this fight, as the bat will largely focus on you with its ranged flying attacks, and as it drops to the ground between attacks, the little pig guy will be right there waiting for score some free hits. Don't be afraid to fall back either and wait for him to heal you as needed, but otherwise you can bait out several of the Apramana Bats ranged attacks without having to worry too much about closing the distance until the opportunity presents itself, allowing your sidekick to chip away in the meantime. 

Once defeated, you'll gain a journal entry, experience, and some materials for your victory, but the Apramana Bat itself will retreat, and fly off into the distance. This won't be the last you see of it... 

Apramana Bat

![Wukong Bitter 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b6/Wukong_Bitter_43.jpg)

Now that the bat is gone, return to the skull of the Serpent General and interact with it. You'll then see Turtle General look over and mourn his fallen friend, causing a giant glowing green tear to fall. 

![Wukong Bitter 44.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/ff/Wukong_Bitter_44.jpg)

Be sure to head back near the Northern Shore Shrine, and you'll find his glowing green tear. It is actually a **Turtle Tear Gourd Soak** , and can be incredibly useful as the only surefire means of restoring your mana when using your Gourd! 

Back at the remains of Snake General, you can find a small path leading up to the left from his bones. 

![Wukong Bitter 45.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3e/Wukong_Bitter_45.jpg)

Head up the path toward a series of stone stairs, but be ready to deal with a new wolf enemy, the Wolf Guardian. Much like Wolf Assassins, they are highly mobile and can dart in and out of combat with their large sickles, but between you and your companion, he won't last long. 

![Wukong Bitter 46.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/79/Wukong_Bitter_46.jpg)

As you head up the stone stairs, look for a small pathway on the left where Zhu Bajie will point out a small enclosure. Be ready to deal with both a Falcon Fan-Maker and Cyan Bat. Shut down the Falcon with Immobilize so you can quickly remove the bat, and then focus your attention on defeating the stronger falcon enemy. 

With both of them down, you'll find that they were guarding a **Luojia Fragrant Vine** , which you can now bring back to the Zodiac Village instead of going all the way back to Chapter 1! 

North Shore of the Bitter Lake Luojia Fragrant Vine

![Wukong Bitter 47.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/89/Wukong_Bitter_47.jpg)

At the top of the stone stair path, there's a small side path leading back to a spot with a Ginsengling overlooking the enclosure, and a tunnel. Take the tunnel, and you'll find a shortcut back toward the North Shore Shrine, but first you'll need to deal with a few Monk Supporters holding their heavy stones. 

![Wukong Bitter 48.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e2/Wukong_Bitter_48.jpg)

The closest one in the tunnel entrance guards a **Treasure Chest** with a Mind Cor and materials inside, but try to take them on one at a time to make things easier. Follow the tunnel path to find a green Wisp, and it will empty out right at the larger tunnel entrance leading to the next main area. 

![Wukong Bitter 49.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f3/Wukong_Bitter_49.jpg)

Beware of another tentacle abomination monk waiting for you as you drop down, and then head through the tunnel passage as it begins to narrow. 

![Wukong Bitter 50.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4b/Wukong_Bitter_50.jpg)

Once you reach a fork in the tunnel, take the left exit to head outside, where you'll find a **Treasure Chest** on the right by a large mural, and several Frozen Corpses on a wooden platform to the left. 

![Wukong Bitter 52.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/68/Wukong_Bitter_52.jpg)

Head back inside the tunnel and take the right path, and you'll find a bridge to cross with a green Wisp to absorb, and the next Shrine to rest at. 

## Precept Corridor

From the Precept Corridor Shrine, you'll be able to traverse a new path across a wooden platform heading down a slope toward a large stone slab that seems to have fallen in your path. 

![Wukong Bitter 53.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3e/Wukong_Bitter_53.jpg)

Along this road are several important things to take note of: There's a lone Wolf Guardian patrolling this road, but you can also find a **Meditation Spot** just off to the left in front of a statue where two Frozen Corpses can come alive to attack. 

The Statue, Precept Corridor Meditation Spot

Just beyond the Meditation Point, look at the base of the fallen stone slab blocking your path, and you'll find that someone has placed an altar in front of it, which a small **Treasure Chest** holding the formula for the Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets, along with a few free samples! 

![Wukong Bitter 54.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/12/Wukong_Bitter_54.jpg)

Take a new path off to the right from the fallen stone slab, and you'll find a large wall with two paths in either direction. Head to the right first to find a Monk Supporter standing over a green Wisp you can absorb, and then take the other path. 

![Wukong Bitter 55.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d6/Wukong_Bitter_55.jpg)

Continue up the stairway until you find an opening to the left, where you'll enter a hall of statues and a Red-Haired Yaksha blocking your path. He's glowing blue from an empowered spirit, but thankfully with a friend at your side, things should even out in difficulty -- but you should still watch out for their powerful martial arts punches and bicycle kicks. 

Defeating this foe will earn you the Red-Haired Yaksha Spirit, and Zhu Bajie will ask that you go rest at a nearby raised pavilion in a large open area nearby. 

![Wukong Bitter 56.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fc/Wukong_Bitter_56.jpg)

As you reach the pavilion, you'll encounter the same strange chubby little monk you may have spotted when first starting this chapter. The enigmatic monk seems interested in a Buddha statue up on the cliffs above with a big belly button, but it seems invisible to your eyes. 

The monk will suggest "why not worship around with true hearts, for Buddhas may light your path", but what he really means is **four** Buddha. 

![Wukong Bitter 57.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/23/Wukong_Bitter_57.jpg)

Head left from the pavilion, and you'll find one such large crowned Buddha statue between two columns that you can interact with and pray to. 

![Wukong Bitter 58.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2d/Wukong_Bitter_58.jpg)

With one Buddha located, it's time to find the rest. Keep heading left to the edge of the large open plaza to find a path leading down. Absorb a green Wisp as you go, and descend the long flight of stairs leading to the right. 

![Wukong Bitter 59.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Wukong_Bitter_59.jpg)

At the bottom, you'll encounter another Wolf Guardian, but be sure to look to the right after defeating him, and you'll find the second crowned Buddha statue to pray at (A Frozen Corpse Censor Holder is already praying here, but you can cut in line). 

![Wukong Bitter 60.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4c/Wukong_Bitter_60.jpg)

Next, head left through a narrow passage and defeat the Monk Supporter that guards it, before moving left again. Just before you reach the entrance to an underground tunnel, look on the right just past a series of wooden posts to find the third Buddha statue. 

![Wukong Bitter 61.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/32/Wukong_Bitter_61.jpg)

Go inside the doorway into a dimly lit passage, and head right. Keep climbing upward and take out the two Monk Supporters that get in your way. 

![Wukong Bitter 62.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/21/Wukong_Bitter_62.jpg)

When the passage finally ends in a small cave-like room, you'll find a Red-Haired Yaksha on the right guarding the final Buddha statue to pray at. 

Luckily, there's an exit to the left that will dump you out on a low wall (with a green Wisp down by a small tree) leading right back to the pavilion! 

![Wukong Bitter 63.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b1/Wukong_Bitter_63.jpg)

Return to speak with the monk, who ends up teasing Zhu Bajie some more before appearing up on the cliffs above, as a large Buddha statue materializes next to him. 

Sadly, Zhu Bajie will send you off alone and promise to meet you at the summit, which will end your jolly cooperation for now. 

![Wukong Bitter 64.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5f/Wukong_Bitter_64.jpg)

Look for a path to the right of the pavilion and start heading up the winding stairs that criss-cross along the cliffs filled with statues. 

![Wukong Bitter 65.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5e/Wukong_Bitter_65.jpg)

Be on the lookout for various green Wisps to absorb as you ascend, and once you make a hard left to a flat area with a giant red-robed statue nearby, keep an eye out on the right for a **Treasure Chest** full of materials hiding in an alcove. 

![Wukong Bitter 66.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5a/Wukong_Bitter_66.jpg)

Deal with any shambling Frozen Corpses you'll find along this ledge, and keep heading along this path past the large statues to find a slope leading upwards, and a green Wisp behind the last large statue. 

![Wukong Bitter 67.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b4/Wukong_Bitter_67.jpg)

As you climb up, you'll find yourself right in front of the Buddha Statue in the cliffs, and an opening has appeared right through his belly button! You now need only shimmy through the opening, and take the steep pathway up to leave the Bitter Lake behind and start finding the entrance to the **Valley of Ecstacy**. 

Bitter Lake Complete
