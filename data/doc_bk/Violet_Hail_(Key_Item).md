# Violet Hail (Key Item)

Violet Hail is one of the final Key Items you may miss in Black Myth: Wukong's fourth chapter in The Webbed Hollow. Unlike one of the Transformation Spells that bears the same name, this is a one-time use item needed to obtain that spell, hidden in the chapter's secret area. 

_"The remains of the deceased Daoists of Petal Fall Hamlet may be just what Daoist Mi outside the temple is seeking."_**  
  
**The Violet Hail Key Item can be found in Purple Cloud Mountain in The Webbed Hollow by the Petalfall Hamlet Shrine. After talking with Daoist Mi here, you can kill nearby enemies to have a random chance of obtaining it. If you don't get it, simply rest at the Shrine and try again. 

A full breakdown of the Purple Cloud Mountain region can be found on our area page. A guide on how to unlock the secret area in video form is below.
