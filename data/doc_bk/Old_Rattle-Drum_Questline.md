# Old Rattle-Drum Questline

The Rattle-Drum Questline is a hidden side quest in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong, and involves using a specific Old Rattle-Drum Key Item to communicate with the spirit of a boy, and unlock a hidden boss - the Mad Tiger. 

## Where to Find the Old Rattle-Drum

This secret questline can begin once you obtain the **Old-Rattle Drum Key Item**. It is dropped by a Yaoguai Chief Miniboss called the Tiger’s Acolyte. This boss battle can be found at the far end of the Yellow Wind Formation region, at the very end of the **Windrest Hamlet** along a large stone bridge leading back to the Fright Cliff region. 

After defeating the Tiger’s Acolyte, you’ll gain the Old-Rattle Drum, which appears to have belonged to the Acolyte’s son, but no other details are provided. You will need to find three areas where you can use the drum to summon a spirit, in **locations all across the Yellow Wind Ridge**. The only clue you’ll have is that entering the correct area will **cause your vision to warp** , and the ghostly voice of a boy calling out to you. 

## First Location - Windrest Hamlet

The first location you can use the Old-Rattle Drum is close to where you fought the Tiger’s Acolyte, further back in the **Windrest Hamlet**. Return across the bridge to the **Windrest Hamlet Shrine** and pass back through the large gate, immediately taking a left to the **large house surrounded by sitting Withering Corpses**. 

A visual cue will appear along with the **voice of a child** beckoning you, and you’ll be able to use the Rattle-Drum in front of the house. Be warned, as doing so will provoke all the nearby corpses to attack you, but you’ll also get some interesting dialogue from the child. 

## Second Location - Windseal Gate

The second location where you can use the Old-Rattle Drum is on the path down from the sealed stone door where you fought the King of Flowing Sands and his Second Rat Prince son, using the **Keenness of Tiger** and **Sterness of Stone** items from the Vanguard bosses (The Stone Vanguard and Tiger Vanguard) to open the door. 

![Wukong Yellow 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/be/Wukong_Yellow_39.jpg)

Head down from the door towards a bridge, but take a right to pass through a ruined building overhang where several **Weasel Captains** are lurking. 

![Wukong MadTiger 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ef/Wukong_MadTiger_4.jpg)

On the other side of the ruined building, there’s a long roof-like walkway and several Withering Corpses milling about, along with a Ginsengling hiding by a wooden chest. If you already used the Old Rattle-Drum back in Windrest Hamlet, you’ll again hear the spirit of a boy call out to you. Use the drum here, and prepare to fend off the zombies as he speaks to you. Interestingly, he mentions a **secret and a well** before clamming up, giving you one final clue to the third location. 

## Third Location - Sandgate Village

![Wukong MadTiger 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/15/Wukong_MadTiger_5.jpg)

There are many small wells that dot the Yellow Sand Ridge area, but the one you need to seek out is located back in Sandgate Village. Head back to the area where you fought the Earth Wolf and **rescued the Horse Guai** who was tied up by the large statue. 

![Wukong MadTiger 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/85/Wukong_MadTiger_6.jpg)

Look to the **left of that statue altar** , and you’ll find a small field around the back with a concerning amount of skeletons, and a well. Using the Rattle-Drum here one final time will cause the spirit of the boy to appear before you, and invite you to **hop down the well** to meet a “friend”. 

![Wukong MadTiger 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Wukong_MadTiger_7.jpg)

Unfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there. You can interact with the well to drop down to a secret area, where you’ll face off against an incredibly tough and dangerous secret boss, the **Mad Tiger**. 

## Yaoguai Chief Battle - Mad Tiger

The ostracized brother of the Tiger Vanguard, the Mad Tiger may not have his sword, but he’s a violent powerhouse of a boss that’s even more dangerous and possibly more difficult than the other two Tiger bosses. As such, you’ll want to equip yourself with the best possible gear in Chapter 2 — you may even want to complete the chapter and return back from Chapter 3 if you find yourself unable to make a dent in this boss. Make sure you’re stocked up on medicines to help bolster your damage output and damage reduction. 

![Wukong MadTiger 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/76/Wukong_MadTiger_8.jpg)

The Mad Tiger will begin the fight with a fast leap, landing with a slashing single blow you’ll need to dodge and then retaliate. 

![Wukong MadTiger 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/02/Wukong_MadTiger_14.jpg)

Other times, he’ll perform a feinting strike by leaping to one side of you with an uppercut, and then changing direction to slam down after a delay in your direction. 

![Wukong MadTiger 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/52/Wukong_MadTiger_11.jpg)

There’s another leaping jump he can perform to twist his body high in the air like his brother before crashing down, only this attack also sends his head slamming into the ground. This can work in your favor with a well-timed dodge, as he slowly recovers while grabbing his head from the impact. 

![Wukong MadTiger 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/21/Wukong_MadTiger_10.jpg)

He may not have a sword, but the Mad Tiger’s fists work just fine, and can employ many combo attacks. His most common one starts with an uppercut punch, and then a downward strike after a short pause, and is then followed by a huge sweeping claw swipe that spins him around. If you want to try using Rock Solid, save it for the swipe so he doesn’t attack through his first two swings. 

Annoyingly, he can also employ a similar strike with only the first two hits, but at a much more rapid pace. 

![Wukong MadTiger 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/13/Wukong_MadTiger_23.jpg)

He also has a different combo strike that often begins with a downward fist punch, followed by two large horizontal claw swipes that spin his body, and ends with him ripping his fist out of the ground in a rising swipe as he leaps backward with the momentum. Immobilize him before he can retreat if you want to retaliate. 

![Wukong MadTiger 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e3/Wukong_MadTiger_12.jpg)

Many of his attacks can then transition into two quick claw swipes with each hand where his arms will remain across his body, and after a moment, will violently lash out with both arms and an outward cross slash you can try to Immobilize to stop. Rock Solid can also help, but it’s unlikely to stagger him out of the move. 

Just be wary, as he’ll often follow up the two arm slash by leaping straight up into the air before crashing down in a slamming attack. 

![Wukong MadTiger 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bd/Wukong_MadTiger_15.jpg)

After beating on him for bit, you may sometimes hear him yell out in anger, which will be a quick tell that he’s about to perform an ear-shattering roar that can damage you if you’re near him, and will also cause rocks to fall from the ceiling onto you, and will require quick thinking to avoid. 

![Wukong MadTiger 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/dc/Wukong_MadTiger_16.jpg)

In this rage-filled state, he’ll unleash even more leaping attacks, like a foot-first jump ending in a slam with his right arm, before spiraling upward with another rising claw swipe as he propels himself into the air, and back down onto you for a huge slam that will shatter the earth around the point of impact. 

![Wukong MadTiger 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/05/Wukong_MadTiger_17.jpg)

Another extremely deadly combo he can perform after a roar seems to last forever, making it an ideal time to try Immobilizing him or using a Transformation Spell if you’re in danger of dying from his assault. He’ll race around you before leaping close with a claw strike, followed with a delayed upward slash, and a second soon after, before keeping his arm raised for a moment and then punching down with two hits in quick succession, and a final delayed two-handed slam! Be sure you have enough stamina to keep up sustained dodging for this very long combo attack. 

![Wukong MadTiger 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b6/Wukong_MadTiger_21.jpg)

Another variant after his roar that’s a bit more rare to see — usually when you have some distance on him, is that he'll perform a longer bloodcurdling roar, and then shoot a projectile out of his mouth at you with little warning! 

![Wukong MadTiger 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6b/Wukong_MadTiger_22.jpg)

There are certain times after performing slam attacks that he may keep his claws deep in the ground. If he continues to crouch down while charging up, it means he’ll rip his fists out to send a shower of rocks erupting in your path. 

![Wukong MadTiger 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d1/Wukong_MadTiger_9.jpg)

Other times, he’ll begin to pick up a massive boulder, but instead of tossing it, he’ll leap across the room to personally deliver the massive rock to your face, which can deal a ton of damage. 

![Wukong MadTiger 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d6/Wukong_MadTiger_19.jpg)

And if the rage-filled roars and resulting deadly attacks weren’t bad enough, the Mad Tiger also has a secret grab. It seems to happen most often in retaliation for getting staggered, causing him to fall to his knees placing one hand on the ground. As he rises, he’ll do so with a quick leap toward you, landing with a quick uppercut. 

![Wukong MadTiger 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9a/Wukong_MadTiger_20.jpg)

If you don’t dodge as he lands, he’ll send you into the air, grab you, and slam you repeatedly into the ground — which usually ends in instant death if you have anything less than full health. 

![Wukong MadTiger 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ed/Wukong_MadTiger_18.jpg)

Expect this fight to take a lot of practice, and considerable upgrades in skills on your part to deal enough damage to survive the fight. While most Rock Solid deflections won’t be enough to stop him, retaliating with charged heavy strikes or crashing an Immobilize can sometimes stagger him several times and give you several openings. Using the Azure Dust Transformation is also useful to soak up his most damaging combos and retaliate with heavy charged hits to take chunks off his health. 

Keep practicing against dodging his moves, finding the right times to deflect the end of his combos (or just use Cloud Step to get out of the way) and always watch carefully when you stagger him to avoid his rising grab. Having the concoction to increase your max health can be beneficial if you’re unable to evade his grab or lengthy combos. 

![Wukong MadTiger 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6d/Wukong_MadTiger_24.jpg)

When at last the Mad Tiger falls before you, he’ll release his Mad Tiger Spirit for you to absorb, and drop a Blood of the Iron Bull, Yaoguai Core, Stone Spirit, and 1,023 Will. Be sure to also search the bottom of the well carefully, and you can find a large wooden chest that holds the Plaguebane Gourd!
