# Ashen Slumber

Ashen Slumber is one of the best Transformation Spells in Black Myth: Wukong for crowd control and dealing sustained damage. It has a solid basic combo, a fantastic heavy attack, and a self-destruct attack that can completely destroy groups of enemies. 

With it, you can transform into a rat guai, slashing at the enemy while blowing fierce flames at them, inflicting Scorch Bane. Focus built up before transformation can be converted for use afterwards within the rat guai's form. 

Ashen Slumber's moveset is as follows: 

  * **Light Attack: Chop Wood - Swing the iron blade to build up Focus.** This is a standard four-hit combo.

  * **Heavy Attack: Blow Fire - Hold heavy attack to unleash, consuming Focus to continuously burn enemies ahead.** This is a great crowd-control move, damaging enemies with a continuous stream of fire for several seconds ahead of it.

  * **Spell: Fiery Burst - Upon self-detonation, deals area damage triggers de-transform.** This is a manual de-transform attack that can be activated to have Ashen Slumber blow up.
