## Guangmou Location

Follow the path from the Snake Trail Keeper's Shrine and make your way down to the large, flat, open area filled with bamboo and skeleton enemies. At the edge of this area is a small gap in the rock wall that you can pass through. Guangmou will be waiting for you inside.

## Guangmou Fight

Guangmou has a lot of magic-based attacks that can hit you from all angles and can inflict status effects. Here are the attacks you can expect to see in the Guangmou fight: 

  * Silver Projectiles 
  * Poison Spray 
  * Teleportation
  * Razor Leaf
  * Tornado
  * Guangmou also summons snakes onto the battlefield that spit poison projectiles at you. 

Guangmou's projectiles, Razor Leaf, and Tornado attacks are reasonably easy to avoid once you understand their timing. The main thing you will have to contend with here is poisoning. You can sustain poison damage in this fight, so keep an eye on your Health if you get poisoned and refuel with your Gourd when it gets too low. You will know when you're poisoned when you start emitting a green, smoke-like substance. 

You can also keep track of your status effects by checking the symbols underneath your health bar.

  * **Veiled Vipers**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Poison Damage and Poison Resistance.

Guangmou's Spirit Power allows you to take his form and summon two snakes to the battlefield. These snakes will shoot poison projectiles at your foe, damaging them and inflicting them with poison. The equipped effect boosts your poison damage and poison resistance, which is extremely handy in places like the Webbed Hollow.
