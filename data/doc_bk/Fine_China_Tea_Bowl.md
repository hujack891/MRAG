# Fine China Tea Bowl

The Fine China Tea Bowl is one of the Curios items found in Chapter 3 of Black Myth: Wukong. While found along the main progression path, the Curios is actually rather easy to miss as it is in the confusing and stressful Pagoda Realm area. 

With the Fine China Tea Bowl equipped, your stamina recovery rate will moderately increase, making it easily one of the best Curios items in the game.

Curios in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, you will want to switch to other Curios items to better fit your build as you . This can be done at any point from the Equipment menu.

As mentioned, finding this Curios item isn't the easiest. The Fine China Tea Bowl is in a box by a statue and a blade-wielding enemy in the Pagoda Realm along the lowest level. From the Lower Pagoda Shrine in The New West continue along to the end of the path, ignoring the stairs up a level. 

At the end of this lowest level, just ahead of the stairs, you can find the statue and box with the Curios item in it.
