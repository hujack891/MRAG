## Snake Sheriff Fight

The Snake Sheriff fights like all other enemies of its type. Watch out for the beast slashing you with its long claws, pouncing on you, and sweeping you off your feet with its long, snake-like neck. These enemies are fast and ferocious, so don't be afraid to cast Immobilize if you need a breather.

  * **Tiger Roar**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Attack, but considerably reduces Defense. 

The Snake Sheriff's Spirit allows you to take the form of the tiger and roar into the battlefield, shaking and dealing damage to any nearby enemies. This attack does a moderate amount of damage but has a double-edged sword effect, making it suitable for only some styles. The effect boosts your Attack a little bit while massively reducing your Defense. This exchange won't be worth it for all ers.
