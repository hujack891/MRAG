# Mother of Stones

The Mother of Stones is an optional Yaoguai Chief miniboss that you can encounter in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong. As an optional foe, you can seek out this boss as part of the Man-in-Stone's Quest, and gain the ability to turn into a Rock Guai yourself by defeating her.

## Where to Find the Mother of Stones

You can encounter the Mother of Stones boss while exploring the Fright Cliff area, which becomes available after defeating the King of Flowing Sands and his Second Rat Prince, and then heading right to cross a rope bridge. 

Once inside the Fright Cliff region, head past the Squall Hideout Shrine and keep left to enter a large cave area, and take a left turn to find the unresponsive boss. 

### Mother of Stones Boss Fight

This boss battle is an interesting one, simply because the giant crystal-embedded statue known as the Mother of Stones doesn’t actually fight you. It doesn’t really move at all, but it has a lot of health to slowly chip through. 

What will fight you, however, is the army of Palestones you can spot embedded in the ground and walls all around you. Make no mistake, this will be an endurance battle, as you’ll need to survive repeated encounters with more and more Palestones.

After taking enough damage, the Mother of Stones will let out a roar, signaling a Palestone will quickly appear to defend her. That’s your cue to immediately break off your attack, regain your stamina, and be ready to dodge the incoming stone monster. Survival will hinge on how well you can deal with each wave while taking minimal damage, and understanding their melee and ranged attacks.

Once you’ve defeated two waves of single Palestones each, the third wave will consist of two Palestones at the same time. This can be a huge problem fast if they gang up on you with alternating attacks. Deflecting their ranged quartz missiles isn’t too bad… until you’re also dealing with one trying to body slam you. 

This is the time to use everything in your arsenal to stay alive. Make sure you’re using your Spirit attacks to focus fire a target, unleash any stored Focus Points, and use Immobilize or Cloud Step to stay out of danger.

There’s one last wave of two after this, for a total of six Palestones for the whole fight. Again, don’t hold back, and use your Transformation Spell to power down at least one of the enemies as quickly as possible so you aren’t overwhelmed. Don’t be afraid to back well off and heal to stay out of range of their projectiles.

Once all six Palestones are down, there’s nothing left that the Mother of Stones can do, so keep smacking it until the boss breaks apart. You’ll be awarded the **Stone Essence** Key Item, as well as some Stone Spirits and Yaoguai Cores.
