# Old Gourd

The Old Gourd is the starting Gourd on offer in Black Myth: Wukong. It is by far the simplest Gourd in the game, focusing entirely on refilling your health. Unlike some of the other Gourds, the Old Gourd doesn't have any special effects or alterations. 

Each sip from the Gourd will restore 33% of your maximum health by default with the Coconut Wine, and the Gourd has four uses by default.

The Gourd can be upgraded at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove in Black Wind Mountain, upping the uses and effectiveness. Doing this turns it into the Medicine Gourd, Healing Gourd, Medicine Sage Gourd, and Medicine Master Gourd with each upgrade. 

The upgrades for this Gourd are: 

  * Old Gourd
  * Medicine Gourd
  * Healing Gourd
  * Medicine Sage Gourd
  * Medicine Master Gourd
  * Supreme Gourd

That final Gourd upgrade requires you to have already levelled up your Gourd to 9 Healing Charges. You can then interact with the NPC at Furnace Valley - Rakshasa Palace in Flaming Mountains to get the final upgrade. 

However, you will likely move onto using a different Gourd as you reach Chapters 2 and 3, to get the better healing effects and unique effects. 

As mentioned, you can't find the Old Gourd. It is given to you by default at the start of Chapter 1. It is provided alongside the default starting weapon in the game, as well as the basic equipment and gear set.
