# How to Defeat the Stone Vanguard With Another Boss

Black Myth Wukong features a staggering amount of tough bosses to defeat, but often hides some secret weakpoints and strategies to defeat them. The Stone Vanguard boss in Chapter 2 in particular has one big weakness - the ability to summon a second boss to defeat him for you! This page contains information on how to summon the Shigandang Yaoguai King boss to defeat the Stone Vanguard for you. 

## Where to Find the Stone Vanguard and Shigandang Boss

Once you enter Chapter 2's Yellow Wind Ridge and explore past the Sandgate Village, you'll have to defeat the King and Second Rat Prince of Flowing Sands, and will find that the door behind them requires to Key Items to unlock. One of these is the Sterness of Stone, held by the Stone Vanguard located in the Fright Cliff area to the right across a rope bridge.

Travel through the Fright Cliff and past the Squall Hideout Shrine and through a cave to reach the Rockrest Flat area.

Stick to the left side, and you'll find an archway leading into a large field with floating stones that become the Stone Vanguard Yaoguai King boss. However, you may also notice a large rock on the left as you enter.

If you try interacting with it early, you'll find an inscription about how this rock is actually the Shigandang Yaoguai King Boss, sealed away with six items of divinity, which you can use to release him. 

## How to Summon the Shigandang Boss

In order to release the Shigandang from his prison, you'll need to search the Fright Cliff for six Buddha statue heads, and claim all six Buddha Eyeballs from them. You can find a detailed guide for All Buddha Eyeball Locations here, or check see the quick list below: 

  1. Located on the path up to the Squall Hideout Shrine.
  2. To the left of the large cave entrance in the Squall Hideout area.
  3. On top of a small ruin in the Squall Hideout area above a crevice.
  4. On the opposite side of the crevice from the previous statue head along a main path.
  5. At the very end of the large cave tunnel leading past the Mother of Stones to an outdoor platform.
  6. Just ahead from the Rockrest Flat Shrine on the way to the boss arena.

Once you have all six Buddha Eyeballs (and have not defeated the Stone Vanguard on your own), you can interact with the large rock before engaging the Stone Vanguard to summon the Shigandang. 

The Shigandang will immediately charge the Stone Vanguard, prompting a Yaoguai King Boss Battle that you get to watch (though you're still susceptible to their massive earthquake attacks)!

The Shigandang is a much stronger boss than the Stone Vanguard, though it will take a bit of damage in the scuffle.

However, after losing around a fourth or more of its health, the Shigandang will most likely grab the Stone Vanguard and perform a devastating pile-driver slam, before flinging the Stone Vanguard aside as it breaks apart.

This will effectively defeat the Stone Vanguard for you, and you'll earn all the associated experience and item rewards, like the Sterness of Stone.

The bad news is that the Shigandang will immediately turn on you, and is an incredibly formidable foe. If you are defeated, the Shigandang will return to its buried spot when you reawaken at the nearby Shrine, allowing you to summon it again when you're ready to go one on one, and freely explore the Rock Crash Platform beyond the arena without having to defeat the Shigandang.
