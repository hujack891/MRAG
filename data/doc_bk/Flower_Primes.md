# Flower Primes

Flower Primes is one of the two Mythical Soaks for your Gourds in Black Myth: Wukong. The Soak's ability is exceptionally strong. 

With the Flower Primes Soak equipped, using the gourd removes all Four Bane states, which can be vital to your final stretch through the game or your New Game Plus through. 

Soaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Flower Primes Location

The Flower Primes Soak can be found at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove in Black Wind Mountain upon completing Chapter 5 in The Flaming Mountains. Simply rest at the first Shrine in Chapter 6 and travel back to him to buy it for 12,000 Will.

Soaks are far more plentiful than the drinks for your gourds. They are scattered throughout the game, across each chapter.

You can also keep track of the Awaken Wine Worm locations and Luoija Fragrant Vine locations, which are key to upgrading your healing potential and Gourd.
