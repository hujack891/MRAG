# Back Scratcher

The Back Scratcher is one of the Curios items you can easily miss in Black Myth: Wukong, especially as it is actually located in a chapter you have already completed by the time you have access to it. 

With the Back Scratcher equipped, you will get a considerable increase to your maximum stamina, making the Back Scratcher one of the best Curios items in the game. You may even end up using it for the entirety of the rest of your through if it fits your build.

As with all other Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong, the Back Scratcher can't be upgraded, so you aren't able to increase its power, although it is already quite strong. If you need to switch your Curios item for any reason, you can do this from the Equipment menu. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Back Scratcher Location

The Back Scratcher can be purchased from the Shrine store in Black Wind Mountain, after completing Chapter 1. Once you have reached a Shrine in Yellow Wind Ridge in Chapter 2, simply head back to Black Wind Mountain, use the Shrine, enter the store and it will be waiting there for you to buy. 

You will need a little bit of Will to grab it, but by this point in the game, you should have your Will from the enemies you have fought in the Sandgate Village or from defeating Black Bear Guai at the end of Chapter 1.
