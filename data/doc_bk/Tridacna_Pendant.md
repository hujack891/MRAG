# Tridacna Pendant

The Tridacna Pendant is one of the various Curios pieces of equipment you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. This large Curios item offers a universal buff that can be useful for almost anyone practically. 

With the Tridacna Pendant equipped, all of your spell cooldowns will be reduced slightly, which is key when fighting some of the bosses in Chapter 2 and beyond, as the difficulty ramps up.

Like the rest of the Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong, this one can't be upgraded, so you are stuck with its basic level of strength. Therefore, you will want to switch to other Curios items if you want a better ability or want one that fits your build more. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Tridacna Pendant Location

The Tridacna Pendant can be found by defeating Black Loong behind the sand waterfall at Fright Cliff \- Rockrest Flat Shrine in Yellow Wind Ridge. This will require you to defeat the First Prince of Flowing Sands, and collect the Loong Scales from behind the wall next to the arena. 

This wall can be broken by the boss' attacks or a really powerful attack from one of the Transformation Spells after the fight. You can then take the Loong Scales to the Sand Wall and enter the secret area. Our video guide on how to get behind the Sand Wall below will help you out.
