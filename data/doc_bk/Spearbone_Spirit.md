## Spearbone Location

Spearbone can be found lurking outside the sand waterfall in Yellow Wind Ridge. To find him, make your way to the Rockrest Flat Keeper's Shrine. Turn right (if you're facing the Shrine) and run up the staircase you will find there to reach a small platform. Spearbone will be waiting on the platform.

## Spearbone Fight

Spearbone fights like all of the other enemies of his kind in Yellow Wind Ridge. To defeat him while taking minimal damage, keep your distance and wait for him to charge at you with his shield. Wait until he is right in front of you with his shield raised and dodge to the side. Turn around quickly, run to Spearbone, and land a combo on his back before he turns back around. Repeat this process until he is bested.

  * **Evil Banisher**
  * Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Damage Reduction. 

Spearbone's Spirit Power allows you to embody him for just long enough to use his iconic shield charge move. This is likely to stagger most enemies after, leaving you free to land another combo before they recover. The equipped effect Spearbone offers increases Damage Reduction, but only by a very marginal amount.
