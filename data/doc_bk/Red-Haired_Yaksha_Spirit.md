The Red-Haired Yaksha is alone in the room where you fight him, so you can focus all your attention on him without having to worry about reinforcements.

  * **Punishing Arrow**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Heavy Attack Damage. 

The Red-Haired Yaksha's Spirit Power allows you to embody the Yaksha and release one strong arrow in your enemy's direction. The arrow deals a healthy amount of damage and can stagger the target, leaving you free to land another combo before they recover. Having the Red-Haired Yaksha equipped increases your Heavy Attack moderately, which is decent considering your Heavy Attack is already quite powerful.
