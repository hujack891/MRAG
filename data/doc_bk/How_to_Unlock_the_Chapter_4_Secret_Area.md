## How to Find the Venom Daoist

After the fight with the Second Sister in Estate of the Zhu, youâ€™ll drop down into a hole that will take you to the Upper Hollow. From here, go up the slope toward the Upper Hollow Shrine.

Just behind the shrine sits a torch and a wooden path that goes off to the right. Take this path and head up the stairs, then follow it until you get to the end, where there's a small drop down. 

![Chapter 4 Secret Area \(1\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/08/Chapter_4_Secret_Area_%281%29.png)

You should now see a large rock in the middle of the room with white eggs near it. Drop down and head right, sticking as close to the rock as possible. 

![Chapter 4 Secret Area \(9\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1a/Chapter_4_Secret_Area_%289%29.png)

There is a torch here by a broken wooden path. It will seem like a dead end beyond this torch, and a large pit below, but you can drop down safely. 

![Chapter 4 Secret Area \(8\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Chapter_4_Secret_Area_%288%29.png)

Ignore the tree branch in front and turn to the right, dropping down from the edge of the wooden ledge. Turn left, and you'll start to see white sacs lining the path. Head toward these and follow the path around to the left. Be careful as you go through here, as the sacs will open and insects will appear. 

![Chapter 4 Secret Area \(7\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5c/Chapter_4_Secret_Area_%287%29.png)

In the next room, continue on past the archer, and through the opening in the rocks on the right. You'll be immediately met with a giant mass of web, where you'll want to go left and continue following the path where the white sacs are. 

![Chapter 4 Secret Area \(6\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5b/Chapter_4_Secret_Area_%286%29.png)

Pass through here to enter a bigger room, with a set of stairs leading up to the next level. Go up here and follow the winding path along the right. 

![Chapter 4 Secret Area \(5\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/be/Chapter_4_Secret_Area_%285%29.png)

When you get to the top, you'll see it branch off to the left (where the torch is) and continue onward. Stick to the path going onward, and follow this around to the right. This will bring you to your next shrine, which is the Pool of Shattered Jade Keeper's Shrine. 

![Chapter 4 Secret Area \(4\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/91/Chapter_4_Secret_Area_%284%29.png)

From here, go right and continue following the path lined with spider sacs. As you reach the other side, you'll see a large white sac in the middle. 

![Chapter 4 Secret Area \(3\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5c/Chapter_4_Secret_Area_%283%29.png)

Go near it and a health bar will appear for the Old Cocoon. Hit it to destroy it, and eventually reveal the Venom Daoist. When you beat him, he'll run off and allude to settling the score with you once he's reached his full mastery. 

### Warning: Missable Gear!

At the end of this fight, you can potentially receive the Venomous Armguard, but you'll need to approach the fight in a specific way to achieve this. The Venom Daoist has 6 arms on his back, and you'll need to break the bottom 4 for him to drop the armguards. If you kill him before doing this, he won't drop anything. Use the lowest damage weapon that you have, and focus your attacks on his back. If you're having trouble with it, use Immobolize to keep him still. 

## How to Find the Venom Daoist for the Second Time

In order to unlock the secret area for Chapter 4, you'll need to find the Venom Daoist again. Once you've beaten him for the first time, continue to  on through the chapter until you get to the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Progress through this area until you come to the Temple Entrance Keeper's Shrine.

From here, go through the door to the right of the shrine and straight up the stairs. Go through the door at the top, and into the courtyard with the giant tree in the middle. 

![Chapter 4 Secret Area \(10\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/da/Chapter_4_Secret_Area_%2810%29.png)

Here, you'll want to take a left and go across the water and up the stairs. Once you've taken the next set of stairs up, you'll come to a path with another tree at the end of it. 

![Chapter 4 Secret Area \(11\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3f/Chapter_4_Secret_Area_%2811%29.png)

Turn right at this tree, pass through the building, and follow the stairs and slope up to the next area. 

![Chapter 4 Secret Area \(14\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/88/Chapter_4_Secret_Area_%2814%29.png)

Take a sharp left at the top of the slope, to go up another set of stairs. Then go right up to the next set. At the top of these, look for an opening on the left that can be easily missed. 

![Chapter 4 Secret Area \(15\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/75/Chapter_4_Secret_Area_%2815%29.png)

Go through the opening in the rocks and follow the path down and into the cave. 

![Chapter 4 Secret Area \(13\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f3/Chapter_4_Secret_Area_%2813%29.png)

As you head into the middle, the Venom Daoist will appear again. In this fight, once you get him down to half-health, a cutscene will . He'll tell you to face him properly now that he's lost most of his arms, and another round of the fight will begin. This time, he'll be at full health but much slower with his recovery after attacks. 

![Chapter 4 Secret Area \(17\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0a/Chapter_4_Secret_Area_%2817%29.png)

Once you've beaten him, he'll reference Purple Cloud Moutain and you'll see a wall appear nearby. Interact with this to enter Purple Cloud Mountain.
