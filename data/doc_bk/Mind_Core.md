# Mind Core

Mind Cores, like Blood of the Iron Bull, are one of the rarest Crafting Materials in Black Myth: Wukong and it is vital that you find as many of them as possible to be able to provide passive upgrades to your stats, health, damage, and defense.

Initially, as you start your journey, it isn't clear what Mind Cores do or where you can use them. However during Chapter 2 in Yellow Wind Ridge you will be able to start using them, providing you complete a questline. 

## Where to use Mind Cores in Black Myth: Wukong

Mind Cores can be used at Xu Dog in the Crouching Tiger Temple \- Cellar area to upgrade your stats. From the Shrine, you can look to your right to find Xu Dog who will upgrade your stats. 

You will have to complete some tasks before being able to access his upgrades. This includes finding him in the path through the cave in Sandgate Village \- Village Entrance and defeating Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw in the pit beneath him.

This will cause him to move on to the Cellar area of the Crouching Tiger Temple. From there, you will need to obtain both the Keeness of Tiger and Sterness of Stone Key Items from defeating the Tiger Vanguard and Stone Vanguard bosses along the chapter's main story path. 

You can then use these items on the Tallies around Yellow Wind Ridge. To access the Crouching Tiger Temple cellar, you will need to activate the Tally in the arena where you fought the Tiger Vanguard and continue down until you reach the slope, leading you to the Shrine.
