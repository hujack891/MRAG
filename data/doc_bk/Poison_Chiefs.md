### Poison Chief Fights and Boss Guides

Thankfully, each of the Poison Chief fights is pretty much the same. You can expect the same moveset and should prepare for them in the same way. If you're not using a general build, be sure to equip gear, curios, and spirits that give you Poison Resistance. Though this is another boss with a limited moveset, it can be easy to die to the Poison Chiefs if you're not careful.

Just like stone bosses and the flint bosses from Chapter 5, most of the attacks from the Poison Chief will be charges and slams. It will try to use the weight of its body to attack while delivering smatterings of poison around the area. 

Its charges can be avoided, by dashing out of the way just before it reaches you. A similar approach can be applied to dealing with its lunges and punches.

The biggest issue is the poison attacks, and it's essential to interrupt them as often as you can. The Plantain Fan can prove invaluable here once again, especially if you deploy it just before a poison attack. It will push the Poison Chief back and allow you to follow up with attacks. Use Immobilize when the Plantain Fan has stopped working, to keep it in place and deplete its health as quickly as possible.
