Take down the next two bull guards you encounter, and look to the right to find a chest. Open it to pick up the Septenary Heartfire Pill Formula, then follow the path to the left and into the ruins.

To your left, immediately as you enter the room, you'll find the Purge Pit Keeper's Shrine.

After activating the first of the Keeper's Shrines, face away from it and head to the right. Go down the stairs and to the end of the path to find a Meditation Spot. 

The Screen, Purge Pit Meditation Spot

Return to the Keeper's Shrine and continue past it, following the path to the right. Head down to the slope, collecting the green Wisp on the left and into the center of the room. As you reach the middle, you'll be met by the first of the bosses in this secret area. 

## Yaoguai Chief - Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top

It turns out that the spiked gold ball is hiding a secret inside, which is two minibosses for you to take on. They will both use a portion of the ball as a shield and have a sword to complement it. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(18\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/28/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2818%29.png)

Like the other pairs of bosses in the chapters, you'll have them attack you in succession. You'll start with Bottom Takes Top, who will cycle through two moves. He'll leap at you -- just dodge back from this -- and then roll into the ball. You can attack him while he regains his composure when he's inside it. 

To follow this, he'll put his sword away, then jump at you and slam the ball down. He'll then drag it around him. Both of these attacks can be avoided by keeping your distance. Attack when he's getting himself back together, and chip away at his health steadily. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(19\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c9/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2819%29.png)

When you've knocked his health bar down, he'll retreat and Top Takes Bottom will take over. She'll jump to get into her half of the ball and spin toward you. This will be quick, but you can dodge out of the way of this. She will also imitate Bottom Takes Top and leap up with her sword, eventually rolling into her half of the ball. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(21\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9d/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2821%29.png)

While they do share a lot of the same moves, you'll also find that Top Takes Bottom will throw her sword out like a boomerang, which you'll need to quickly evade. She will also perform an additional leaping attack, where her blade will glow and pools of lava will explode from underneath her. Jump back as soon as you see the blade land and start to glow.

When her health bar is also knocked down slightly, they will start to swap in and out. It can start to get a bit hectic, so use Cloudstep to throw them off, heavy attacks to stagger and knock down their shields, and Immobilize to keep them from zipping about. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(22\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/af/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2822%29.png)

After successfully wounding them both enough, you'll see them merge together and form the golden spiked ball. They'll use this to jump up in the air, pull back, and spin to launch themselves toward you. They will keep rolling around the room, and it's just a case of dodging this. However, when they're about to finish, they become significantly more aggressive and will leap up in the air again, slamming the ball down and causing explosions on impact. You'll need to dodge or jump to avoid this. Then the cycle will repeat again until you're able to put an end to them.

After defeating Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top, go up the stairs. Take out the bull guard on the right as you enter the next section, and collect the green Wisp it stands near. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(25\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d7/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2825%29.png)

Continue down the path and look to your left to find a small Buddha statue. Behind it is a small alcove where you'll find a gold pot that has a Celestial Nonary Pill inside.

Get back to the path and go past the next two bull guards to find the Cave Depths Keeper's Shrine. 

## Cave Depths

Go left from the Keeper's Shrine and down into the corridor where you'll find several bull guards and a Bull Governor guarding the door. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(26\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fd/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2826%29.png)

As soon as you get to the bottom of the stairs, look to the right to find a green Wisp to collect. Carry on down the corridor, then look to the left to find a treasure chest. 

It's best to clear the room out first and return to this chest to collect The Bull King's Iron Horn, Celestial Ribbon, and Knot of Voidness from it. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(26\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fd/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2826%29.png)

The last thing to note in this corridor is you'll get a Bull Governor Spirit from the Bull Governor guarding the door. 

Bull Governor Spirit

Head through the door when the area is clear and follow the winding path until you can see a green Wisp on the left, and two bull guards on the right. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(28\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/81/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2828%29.png)

Go and collect the green Wisp, then slide down the ice-covered path to the left of it. When you get to the bottom, go straight up and then go around the rock on the right, past the statue (back toward the bull guards). 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(29\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c4/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2829%29.png)

Drop down and you'll find a chest here, where you can grab Gold Tree Core and Blood of the Iron Bull. Climb back up and now head through the passageway into room, this time covered in ice and lava. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(30\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cc/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2830%29.png)

Drop down toward the lava and go left into the ice-covered portion of the room. Open the chest on the right to collect Celestial Ribbon and a Mind Core. 

Head down to the left, and slide all the way down the slope. Here you'll reach the final Keeper's Shrine of the hidden area, called the Corridor of Fire and Ice. 

## Corridor of Fire and Ice

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(32\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bf/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2832%29.png)

Head right from the Keeper's Shrine and go down the stairs. A cutscene will  as you drop down, and the Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast will appear. 

## Yaoguai King - Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(44\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2844%29.png)

The fight will begin immediately as the beast launches itself at you. It's extremely agile, and a lot of the fight will be the beast hurtling towards you, trying to take swipes at you. Despite this agility, you'll see familiar moves to other bosses you've encountered in this Chapter so far. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(36\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5f/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2836%29.png)

The Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast likes to use punching attacks similar to the Stone Vanguard and the coffin carts. It will perform combos of smashing its fists down and creating pools of lava that will explode. The best way to deal with these is to dodge them or try to hang back from the beast as far as you can. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(39\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c0/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2839%29.png)

It will sometimes roll over when it tries to punch you and misses, allowing you to perform a quick follow-up attack. Where it differs from the other bosses, is that it will also leap up in the air and land like a frog, creating an explosion around it each time it lands. This move can be quite erratic, but you can avoid it entirely by keeping your distance. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(37\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c8/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2837%29.png)

One move to watch out for that has a wider area of attack is when it scraps its fist along the floor and flings an arc of fire toward you. These will stay on the ground for a while, and the beast can create multiple of them at once. This is when you'll want to have the Body-Cooling Powder and Fireproof Mantle on hand, as it becomes harder to dodge these the more they build up. 

Besides this, it will also charge at you leaving a trail of fire behind it. When it's charging, it's best to dodge the attacks and aim to build up Focus. The heavier you can attack, the better, because you'll want to stun the beast as often as possible. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(33\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/44/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2833%29.png)

When you enter the arena, on the other side, you'll see another frozen-over archway. You can actually bait the beast to break this down and escape inside of it. While he's still trying to attack you, you can use Thrust Stance to get him. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(41\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ab/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2841%29.png)

Head up the stairs in this section and on the right, you'll be able to harvest a Fire Date. On the left, you can find an Awaken Wine Worm, and straight up ahead before the stairs, you'll see a green Wisp on the left.

Continue up the stairs, and you'll see the beast leaping around the rooftops. Go along the corridor, where you'll come to a frozen room with a doorway that has fire blocking it. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(45\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bd/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2845%29.png)

The best will appear again, and this time use freezing variations of the previous attacks. For this, you'll want Body-Warming Powder instead. There is another arena you can reach, and to do so, bait the beast to use a freeze attack on the door blocked by fire, so you can proceed. Go up the stairs and into the next section of the cave, where you'll slide down a frozen path and into the arena. 

![Bishui Cave Walkthrough \(47\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/60/Bishui_Cave_Walkthrough_%2847%29.png)

He'll be back to his fire attacks here but they'll be much more amped up, so you'll want to knock as much of his health down in the first two rounds as you can.
