The Stone Spirit can be found throughout the game's six chapters in the following locations: 

  * In Chests
  * Dropped from enemies upon death
  * Bought from the Shrine Store
  * Rewarded upon completing chapters

You will likely find a lot of them in the middle of your through. Be sure to hold onto them to upgrade your gear fully.
