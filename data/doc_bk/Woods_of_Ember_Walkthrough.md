![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(3\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bb/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%283%29.png)

There's no slow start to Chapter 5, as it begins with Zhu Bajie rushing across the first ashen pass in the Woods of Ember and straight into a fight against several Revenants. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(7\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a7/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%287%29.png)

As soon as you take control of The Destined One, you'll be helping Bajie tackle the zombie-like Yoaguais. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(9\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d3/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%289%29.png)

When you've cleared the area, Bajie will launch into another anecdote. His monologue is soon interrupted by the bodies of the Revenants levitating and disappearing as if they're being recalled. Bajie immediately follows and tells you to catch up when you can. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(11\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/93/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2811%29.png)

Go straight up once you regain control and through the large door. On the other side, you'll need to pass through a short tunnel to reach the **first Keeper's Shrine of the Chapter**. 

Be sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(17\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b5/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2817%29.png) Directly ahead of the Keeper's Shrine, you'll see the area is ablaze and a solitary Revenant stands by the edge. There's not much to do in this area but just before the Revenant, you can find a **Purple Lingzhi** to pull from the ground. There's also a green Wisp to absorb just to the left of the field. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(18\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a0/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2818%29.png)

Once you've grabbed the Wisp, go in the opposite direction and past the Revenant Archer. On the other side of the underpass, you'll walk straight into another round of fighting. This time, you'll find the Revenants fighting Bull Sergeants. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(19\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6f/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2819%29.png)

Before you go over to them, harvest the **Fire Bellflower** by the Buddha statue on the right. Then, go straight up and into the midst of the fighting, to find the Pale-Axe Stalwart taking on nearby Revenants. Alongside the fighting, the area is also being pelted with firebombs so having the Fireproof Mantle Vessel here can help you focus more on the fighting and less on the fire attacks. 

### Boss Fight - Pale-Axe Stalwart

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(21\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/15/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2821%29.png)

The health bar for the Pale-Axe Stalwart will appear as soon as you approach the open area. There will be Revenants and Bull Soldiers fighting around you, but you can ignore these and focus solely on the Pale-Axe Stalwart for this miniboss fight. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(1\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7c/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%281%29.png)

He uses a huge axe, so most of his attacks are slow swings. The main approach to this fight should be to dodge the slow attacks, then immediately follow up with a combo as he takes time to recover. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(23\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fc/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2823%29.png)

Occasionally, he will kick at you or jump up in the air, raising his axe above him. When he does the latter, he will slam it down as he lands, but even with this move, dodging is still the way to go. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(22\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/01/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2822%29.png)

The most beneficial thing to you here is the fire from above. He is also impacted by the fire attacks, so watch where the projectiles land and bait him into standing in the vicinity of them. This will build up his Fire Damage, weakening his health bar while you attack, and also completely stagger him at times, leaving him vulnerable to longer combos and heavier attacks. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(38\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/dc/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2838%29.png)

When you've knocked his health bar almost all the way down, he will kneel. To make the area safer, clear out the rest of the fighting Yaoguais, then approach the Pale-Axe Stalwart, who will now become an NPC with his own side quest for you to complete. 

Pale-Axe Stalwart

Speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart, who will be pleased you've not been harmed. Keep prompting him to talk so you exhaust all of his dialogue. Eventually, he'll tell you about the five element carts and ask you to destroy them. 

He'll also hint that the coffin carts are guarding more than just the passes across the mountains, but we'll revisit that once the side quest is concluded. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(24\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/11/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2824%29.png)

When his dialogue begins to repeat, resume your exploration of the area. First, go over to where there are four chests by the wall (opposite where you first entered the area). Two of the chests are already open, but there are two more to loot. Inside these, you'll find Cold Iron Leaves, Will, a Mind Core, and a Gold Tree Core. 

Now facing away from the chests, go right and up the stairs to begin your ascent of the mountain. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(28\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3a/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2828%29.png)

At the top of the stairs, you'll have another set of steps immediately to the left. But first, go to the treasure chests on the right. There's just one here to be looted, which will give you some gold to sell. Then, directly opposite the stairs, you can find another Fire Bellflower to be harvested. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(30\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/75/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2830%29.png)

Once you've collected everything, head up the next set of stairs. At the top of these steps, the health bar for the Brown-Iron Cart will appear and you can find it blocking the path to the left. However, there's also a broken set of stairs to the immediate right, which you can climb up. This will bring you to a small roof you can run along to collect a green Wisp. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(32\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/10/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2832%29.png)

Dash up the broken steps and run along the small path to get behind the cart. Drop down and you'll also be at the next Keeper's Shrine. 

### Yoaguai Chief - Brown-Iron Cart

![Chapter 5 Secret Area .png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bc/Chapter_5_Secret_Area_.png)

The Brown-Iron Cart doesn't have much variation in attacks. If you approach it head-on, you'll want to use the Fireproof Mantle to help with its continuous fire attacks. But, you can also avoid these by sticking close to its arms. You'll just need to watch out for when it rears slightly up and slams its fists down. Thankfully, this attack can be dodged. 

If you've taken the small path to get behind it as we suggested, and got to the Keeper's Shrine, you have the advantage. The cart can't turn around considering it's on such a small path, so you can ignore the fist-slamming attacks entirely and focus just on when it blows out fire all around it. Use the Fireproof Mantle and watch out for when it blows fire. As soon as it dies down, drop down and hit it relentlessly with combos. When it starts to get ready to unleash the fire, jump back up the little ledge to completely avoid it. 

Brown-Iron Cart

With the first of the five element carts down, go and activate the Camp of Seasons Keeper's Shrine. Rest here, then go back on yourself to see the Pale-Axe Stalwart again. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(35\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e7/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2835%29.png)

Instead of finding him wherever you left him kneeling, you'll now see him by the edge of the cliff. As you come back down the stairs to the area where you fought him, you'll see a small set opposite with two Buddha statues on either side. Go up these and to the left, to find him overlooking the mountain. Talk to him and exhaust any new dialogue. 

## Camp of Seasons

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(37\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5e/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2837%29.png)

From the Camp of Seasons Keeper's Shrine go left and cross the bridge. On the other side of it is an archer, so be prepared to dodge its attacks or use Cloudstep to get across undisturbed. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough .png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/46/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_.png)

Turn right on the other side of the bridge, and start to head through the cave. On the right side of the cave is a green Wisp, but you'll first want to deal with the Revenant Charbone that will run at you as you step into the darkness. These things will cause fire damage and when you've knocked their health bar down, they'll explore. Take it out immediately and then pick up the Wisp, avoiding the explosion. 

### Tip!

When Revenant Charbones explode, it's not just you that they damage - other enemies will be affected as well. Whenever you see them, focus on attacking one and luring it closer to other enemies, to take advantage of their explosive abilities. When they're in groups, and each one has a low health bar, this can sometimes cause a chain of explosions as they knock each other out one by one. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(40\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/91/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2840%29.png)

Exit the little cave and continue on, where you'll see two more Revenant Charbones with a larger figure (a Revenant Charface) straight ahead. Clear these out first, and be careful of the fast slashing attacks from the Revenant Charface, which also continues once you've killed it. 

When it's safe, turn back on yourself. The Fire Bellflower that was on the left as you exited the small cave will now be on the right, and you'll see a path on the right that leads to the next section. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(41\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2d/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2841%29.png)

As you step through the next bit, be careful of the Lavabat. On the other side of this small cave, turn right and cross the bridge. Be ready to fight the Bull Soldier on the other side, but also watch out for the Revenant Charface tucked away on the right who will come at you. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(44\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/35/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2844%29.png)

Once the area is clear, open the chest that the Bull Soldier was guarding. This will give you Cold Iron Leaves and Will. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(39\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bc/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2839%29.png)

Turn and face the opposite direction and deal with the archer on the stairs to the right first. Climb up the stairs to reach a wooden structure, where you can find the first Meditation Spot of the Chapter. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(43\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/34/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2843%29.png)

The Relief, Camp of Seasons Meditation Spot

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(46\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0e/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2846%29.png)

Go back down the stairs, and when you're almost at the bottom, look to the right to find another **Purple Lingzhi y** ou can harvest. Continue on, then turn right and follow the path. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(48\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3d/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2848%29.png)

Watch out for the next Lavabat, and when you've tackled it, **don't head up the long set of stairs**. Instead, go to the left first. Take out the Revenant Archer and the Revenant that will emerge from the floor as you get close. When it's clear, head for the end of the path and turn right. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(45\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f4/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2845%29.png)

Take out the Revenant Charface and Charbone guarding the chest, then open it to collect Fine Gold Thread and a Mind Core. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(50\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7a/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2850%29.png)

Now return and head up the long set of stairs. Clear the area of the Revenant Charface and the Revenant Charbones on either side. When it's safe, go into the small building on the right to pick up the Mount Lingtai Seedlings Soak from the golden turtle. 

Mount Lingtai Seedlings

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(49\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c6/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2849%29.png)

Continue forward, going across the bridge where another Revenant Archer waits for you on the other side. You'll also see a Lavabat hanging from a tree, and three Revenant Charbones kneeling around it. Clear this area, and harvest the **Purple Lingzhi** from underneath the tree. Then, go up the path behind it to the right. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(53\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0a/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2853%29.png)

At the top, a Lavabat will attack you as soon as you reach the area. On the right, you'll find another Bull Sergeant and two more Revenant Charbones. Clear this and then activate the **Height of Ember Keeper's Shrine** near the tree on the right. 

## Height of Ember

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(54\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c4/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2854%29.png)

Look to the right of the Keeper's Shrine to find a green Wisp to absorb. Once you've collected it, continue along the path from the Shrine, toward the open space on the left. When you reach a certain point, the Father of Stones miniboss will jump over the wall near the door on the right. 

### Yoaguai Chief - Father of Stones

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(55\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cf/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2855%29.png)

Just like fights against other stone bosses, it's best to skip elemental damage and go for pure attack power in this fight. You want your attacks to be heavy and hit hard, and for your defense to be up as much as possible. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(56\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/36/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2856%29.png)

Father of Stones will use a variety of attacks in this fight, however, he's limited by the fact that he's holding a skeleton in one arm. This means he'll only ever try to hit you with one arm, giving you more opportunity to evade attacks or dodge them. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(51\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/27/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2851%29.png)

The first thing to watch out for is him swinging his arms in a combination move. He will lazily swing an arm at you a few times. But these can be dodged or missed entirely if you step back far enough. Alternatively, he will reach out to try and hit you, and often falls down straight away after performing the attack. As it takes a little while for him to recover, you can get your own combo of attacks in here. 

He will sometimes leap in the air and try to land on you. Again, these can be dodged and ignored by stepping back. This is actually the case for most of his attacks, so bait him out to hit you and then take advantage of the slow recovery. If you stand behind him too long though, he'll sit down and quickly push himself toward you, rolling over and over to try and catch you. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(57\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e8/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2857%29.png)

The most dangerous of his attacks are the kicks that spark and send out a line of fire in your direction and when he roars. As soon as he opens his mouth, jump or step back to avoid the immediate area around him, where his roars will hit. Otherwise, this will knock you back and damage you. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(52\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bd/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2852%29.png)

The way to approach this fight is to build up your combos and then land a finishing blow on him as often as you can. When you attack like this, the heavy blow will knock him over and leave him vulnerable to a beat down. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(76\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ab/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2876%29.png)

When you've bested him, collect the Father of Stones Spirit he leaves behind. 

Father of Stones

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(77\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/96/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2877%29.png)

From here, the path splits in two different directions. There is a door near the wall where the Father of Stones climbed over, but ignore that for now. Instead, go straight up past it. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(79\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/02/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2879%29.png)

You'll come to a path that slopes down, where you can harvest another **Fire Bellflower** on the left. Once you've collected it, stick to the path that goes up to the right and head for the Turtle Treasure in the distance. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(81\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/02/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2881%29.png)

It guards a chest, so once you've defeated it, open the chest to collect Knot of Voidness along with various medicines. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(82\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/82/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2882%29.png)

Turn back on yourself, and now take the path down to the right. Clear the area of the Revenant Charbones, and head for the bottom of the stairs. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(85\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/25/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2885%29.png)

On the left, you'll see a **Purple Lingzhi** and a path to take, but there's also one straight up ahead at the edge of the cliff. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(87\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c5/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2887%29.png)

Go straight first, then look for the archer on the lower level to the right. Once you've eradicated the archer, follow the path all the way to the right to find three Revenant Charbones guarding a **Luoija Fragrant Vine**. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(89\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bd/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2889%29.png)

Pick up the Fire Bellflower on the left at the bottom of the wooden path before you head toward the Revenants and the vine. 

Height of Ember Luojia Fragrant Vine

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(84\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/73/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2884%29.png)

Turn back on yourself and go back up the stairs and the path. Turn to the right now and grab the Purple Lingzhi by the tree. This will turn into an enemy, but once you beat it, you'll receive a Purple Lingzhi and Nine-Capped Lingzhi. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(90\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/01/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2890%29.png)

In the distance, you'll see more Revenants and a Bull Guard by an altar, where there are green Wisps to collect. Clear the area and absorb the Wisps, then go back up to where you fought the Father of Stones. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(92\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3c/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2892%29.png)

You'll see a door on the left, near hanging yellow fabric. Open this, and head down the stairs toward the statue. The health bar for the Gray-Bronze Cart will appear, but you don't need to worry about fighting it just yet. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(94\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f6/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2894%29.png)

Follow the path to the left and toward the cave at the end of it. Just before you get there, you'll see another green Wisp to be collected to the left. Once you've grabbed it, head inside the cave. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(95\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/12/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2895%29.png)

The cave is very dark, but you'll be able to see the faint glow of a green Wisp to the left and lava to the right. Head for the lava, to find a Revenant Charbone, but also a pathway that leads outside. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(91\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/de/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2891%29.png)

Go out here and toward the statues to collect the Amber Prayer Beads curio from the box. 

Amber Prayer Beads

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(97\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b5/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2897%29.png)

Go back inside the cave and now turn right to collect the green Wisp. Take out the Revenant near it, then go forward. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(98\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a3/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2898%29.png)

The path splits here, and you'll probably notice the green Wisp on the right first. On the left, you'll be able to see an enemy with a blue Spirit. You'll want to head for the green Wisp first. But before you go collect it, be prepared that there's a lot of the Revenant Charbones in this area and they'll all charge at you. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(99\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a3/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%2899%29.png)

Collect the Wisp, then grab the Purple Lingzhi just beyond it that will turn into another enemy. Once you've got the Purple and Nine-Capped Lingzhi, turn right and collect another couple of green Wisps that sit at a dead end. 

Turn around and go straight ahead to where the enemy holds the spirit. Defeat this enemy to get Blood of the Iron Bull and collect the Charface Spirit. 

Charface Spirit

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(100\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/42/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%28100%29.png)

Continue forward and take down the next revenant, so you're free to collect the green Wisp on the right. Then turn left and make your way outside. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(101\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/25/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%28101%29.png)

Look to the right to find a Charface guarding a chest. Defeat the enemy then open the chest to collect Refined Iron Sand. Now face the opposite direction and go straight up the narrow path. At the other end of it, the next element cart blocks your progress. 

![Chapter 5 Secret Area \(3\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/16/Chapter_5_Secret_Area_%283%29.png)

### Yoaguai Chief - Gray-Bronze Cart

Head straight up the narrow path, and when you're close to the cart, look to the left to find an alcove you can dip into to avoid the fire attacks that also has a green Wisp in it. 

![Chapter 5 Secret Area \(9\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/93/Chapter_5_Secret_Area_%289%29.png)

You can expect the same moveset from each of the carts, so again, the Fireproof Mantle Vessel works wonders here. For this one, though, you won't be able to get close to the feet and stay there without being hit with the fire attacks. So, stick close during the fist slam (without the fire) and dodge this. But when it rears up, jump back into the alcove to protect yourself from any fire attacks. 

Gray-Bronze Cart

When the next cart has been defeated, progress up the path. As you approached the cart, you will have heard someone shout for help. Who that is, will soon become clear as you climb the stairs and hear the cries for help again. 

Enter a large open area to find the fox guai suspended from a tree, and her two captors on the way. After she explains that she's been captured, two giant heads will descend upon the arena. 

### Yoaguai Chief - Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind

Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind are a duo of heads that will use two elements to attack, both causing fire damage. As you may have guessed through this Chapter so far, the Fireproof Mantle is one of the best bits of equipment you can bring along with you. Quick as Fire is the head on the ground that will roll toward you, leaving trails of fire in its wake, while Fast as Wind is the floating head with the tusks.

Start by focusing on Quick as Fire, using your Fireproof Mantle to protect you from the floor covered in fire. He will just roll around the arena, spewing fire all over the place, so the main focus is to dodge this and chase him with attacks.

When you have the Fireproof Mantle equipped, you can stand in the fire and continuously hit him without worrying about your health bar. If you hit him hard enough, he'll go flying and you'll need to catch up to him to continue landing attacks.

While you're doing this, Fast as Wind will follow you blowing gusts of wind down on you. If this hits you, it will also burn you. Avoid this while you focus on putting an end to Quick as Fire.

When Quick as Fire is down, the intensity of Fast as Wind's attacks will increase. He'll now start to charge at you, sweeping down as close as possible to the ground, to hit you with his tusks. The best counter to this is a dodge, which will see him hit the ground and get his tusks stuck for a few seconds. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(111\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5f/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%28111%29.png)

Be ready to follow him and hit him as soon as this happens. Even when he pulls his tusks out from the ground, he'll be temporarily stunned, giving you enough time to attack. He will continue to chase you, blowing wind on you, but will also start to spit gusts of wind out. These will turn into small tornados but they're extremely short-lived, so as long as you can dodge the initial gust, you should be able to quickly get out of the way of the tornado. 

Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind

## Ashen Pass II

After defeating them, the fox gaui will transform into Pingping the Bull King's daughter, and thank you for saving her. Once the cutscene is over, you'll receive your rewards for defeating Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind and the next Keeper's Shrine will be available to you, if you follow the path to the left and up the stairs.

Once you've activated the shrine, look opposite it to find a small area where a chest sits. Open this to collect a **Celestial Jade Lotus Pill**. 

Flaming Mountains Celestial Jade Lotus Pill

Return to the path and go right to follow the fox guai through a tunnel in the mountains. Collect the green Wisp straight up ahead and squeeze through the crack to continue following the fox. Stick with her right up until you reach the part of the mountain where a fire is raging. 

![Woods Ember Walkthrough \(103\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d9/Woods_Ember_Walkthrough_%28103%29.png)

The fox will go right, but take a left first to collect a green Wisp up the slope. Then head in the direction that the fox went, to get to the edge of the cliff. She'll transform back into a human, and the next thing for you to do is to jump from the cliff and down into Furnace Valley.
