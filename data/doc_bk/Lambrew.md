# Lambrew

Lambrew is the second of the Black Myth: Wukong Drinks you will likely find, after the Coconut Wine, which is available at the beginning of the game. This Drink offers a slight twist on the Coconut Wine allowing you to heal in a slightly different way. 

Specifically, the Lambrew drink restores 20% of your health with each sip, but then also restores a further 25% of maximum health over time for a short period. This is a pretty solid tradeoff, when healing outside of combat, but the slow healing can be a big problem during fights and against some of the game's bosses. However, if you have mastered dodging and blocking, then this Drink may be more beneficial for you.

As with all Drinks, the potency of this can be increased by finding the Awoken Wine Worm locations around the game's areas. Our guide has all of their locations for you. 

You can then use these special Crafting Materials to upgrade the Drink at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove within Black Wind Mountain. Each upgrade will provide a sizeable buff to your healing potential, but as you level the Drink up, more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed. 

This carries over to New Game Plus too, as you can upgrade your Drinks even more, but once again more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed, so you will have to recollect them all in your new game plus run. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Lambrew location

Lambrew can be found in Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge. It is actually right next to where you spawn at the beginning of the chapter (or behind the Sandgate Village - Village Entrance Shrine if you have already reached it). From the spot where you start the chapter, look on your right to find a hill. Head up this hill to find the Lambrew sitting at the top. 

You can then take the Lambrew to the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove in Black Wind Mountain by travelling via the Shrines. He will let you switch it into your Gourd from the Coconut Wine or any other drink you have.

There aren't too many Drinks in the game compared to the Soaks, so be sure to keep your eye out for them. For even more guides on these areas, check out our full Black Myth: Wukong walkthrough.
