## Where to use the Special-made Bone-Strengthening Pellet in Black Myth: Wukong

With the Pellet in your inventory, you can head back to Chen Loong and give it to him. He will then let you access the Zodiac Realm in The New West, by giving you the Ruyi Scroll"). 

That's it! This is one of the easier Key Items to follow the quest chain for, as it only consists of a few steps. Chen Loong's quest doesn't end there though, so be sure to continue helping him out and talking with him and the other NPCs in the Zodiac Realm.
