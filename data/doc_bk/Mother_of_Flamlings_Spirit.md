## Mother of Flamlings Location

Once you've completed the Iron Ball challenge in the Flaming Mountains and unlocked the Fallen Furnace Crater Keeper's Shrine, head back down the hill and take the newly opened passage on the left. Follow the path until you find a pile of glowing rocks lying in a large clearing. Approach the rocks to awaken the Flint Vanguard. 

Continue down the path after you've defeated the Flint Vanguard, and look to the left to find a small, glowing spot in the ground. Interact with the glowing spot and deliver **four Flame Ores** to summon the Mother of Flamlings.

You can get Flame Ores by defeating Flamlings.

## Mother of Flamlings Fight

The Mother of Flamlings is a stationary boss, which you would think would make the battle easier. Unfortunately, though, summoning the Mother of Flamlings also summons several other Flamlings who will hurl fireballs at you throughout the entire fight. 

Make your way around the arena, picking off the Flamlings so you can focus on the Mother. Continue dodging around the Mother while slashing away to wear down her HP bar and eventually defeat the Mother of Flamlings. If you're struggling with this battle, some Body-Cooling Powder will help with any Burn Damage you might be incurring.

  * **Flamling Queen**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately reduces the Cooldown for all Spells. 

The Mother of Flamling's Spirit allows you to summon two Flamlings of your own to fight alongside you. These Flamlings can not only deal damage to your enemies but also steal their attention so you can sneak up on them and land some surprise attacks while they're not looking. The equipped effect is excellent, reducing the cooldown of all Spells so you can cast more spells in total.
