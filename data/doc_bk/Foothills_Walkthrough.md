# Foothills Walkthrough

Chapter 6 of Black Myth: Wukong begins in the Foothills of Mount Huago with Zhu Bajie and the Destined One starting their ascent up the mountain after acquiring five of the Great Sage's relics. Below, you'll find a Walkthrough of the first major area of Mount Huaguo as well as information on the bosses you'll encounter along the way and items of interest.

The beginning of Chapter 6 is a linear path, so proceed down the slope from where you spawn. As you make your way along this road, you'll be intercepted by the last of the Lesser Yoaguais you need to complete your journal. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(3\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2f/Foothills_Walkthrough_%283%29.png)

This will include Hound, Jackal, and Eagle Soldiers, as well as the tougher looker variants with shields called Captain of the Court. 

As you get closer to the first Keeper's Shrine of the area, you'll see a large group of soldiers appear. Clear these out and then you can activate the shrine. 

Be sure to check the Shrine Shop while you're here, and revisit the Zodiac Village to see what new items everyone has to offer.

![Foothills Walkthrough \(8\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/44/Foothills_Walkthrough_%288%29.png)

Continue straight up from the Keeper's Shrine and into the clearing that's adorned by chains. Make your way into the center of the clearing, where Bajie will exclaim it's a dead end. However, you'll soon be joined by the Supreme Celestial Inspector. If you found all of the Purple Talismans in Chapter 4, then this will be a familiar face to you. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Supreme Inspector

![Foothills Walkthrough \(11\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/91/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2811%29.png)

The Supreme Inspector will use two types of elemental attacks in this fight, which are thunder and fire. In the first third of the fight, it will mainly use thunder attacks, so you'll want to have plenty of Shock-Quelling Powder with you and equip any gear or curios that give you extra resistance to shock. Fire will be introduced in the second portion of the fight, so you'll also want Body-Cooling Powder, and the final part will be a combination of the two elements. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(19\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/99/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2819%29.png)

Though it might seem tempting to equip the Fireproof Mantle, we'd recommend using the Plantain Fan, which will be able to help you in the second phase of this fight. 

The first thing to note as you start the fight is that the Supreme Inspector will use its wings like a pair of arms. It will lunge and punch at you, so you'll need to learn the timings of its wing attacks. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(17\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/da/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2817%29.png)

Secondly, you can expect The Supreme Inspector to fly up into the air quite often, where it will continue to attack you but be unreachable. When it's up in the air, it will largely use projectiles. These are typically in groups and need to be dodged to avoid them. You can throw the Plantain Fan out when it's airborne to immediately bring it back down and leave it vulnerable to attacks. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(15\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d5/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2815%29.png)

The Supreme Inspector is also able to turn its wings to solid gold and deflect your attacks. You can still do damage when this happens, but it'll be minimal. Bajie will explain to you that when this happens, it's best to wait until it spreads its wings again. Still, you should try to be as aggressive as you can while you have Bajie helping you in the first part of the fight. As always, try to reserve any Gourd usage while you have Bajie, as he'll often top up your health. 

Besides the projectiles and using its wings to attack, the Supreme Inspector also uses a sword. This is where the thunder attacks come from, and they can vary significantly. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(12\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/10/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2812%29.png)

In the first portion of the fight, the Supreme Inspector will perform a combo of melee attacks using the sword, often followed by a grab from its feet. Alternatively, he will fly close to the ground and quickly charge toward you. You'll also see The Supreme Inspector rise up from the ground, twirl around, and send out shockwaves in multiple directions. You can move from side to side to avoid these or dodge out of the way. 

Around the halfway mark the Supreme Inspector will switch up attacks and they'll become more aggressive. The combos will become longer, but you'll see the same moveset from the first section. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(21\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f0/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2821%29.png)

The biggest change from here on out is that it introduces a fiery unicycle into the mix. This will make it easier for him to move around the arena, but he'll also kick it out and send this to attack you independently. When this is introduced, he'll be able to burn you. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(18\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/32/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2818%29.png)

The problem with this attack is there are two types of heavy attacks he'll perform here and they can be hard to avoid. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(22\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8d/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2822%29.png)

He'll either launch himself at you and then spin the unicycle around until he flips it up and lands down heavily where you are, or he'll start to spin around the entirety of the arena and multiple duplicates of the unicycle will appear. These will then launch into a crisscross attack to get you, and he'll follow up with a heavy attack. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(23\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d9/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2823%29.png)

When his health is down to the last third, he will cover the arena with a red haze, reducing the size of the arena that you'll fight the creature in. He will also begin to use two swords instead of one. This is when you want to throw out the Plantain Fan. It will clear the red haze immediately and continuously stun him, giving you more time to whittle down his health. 

Supreme Celestial Inspector

After defeating the Supreme Inspector, he'll pick you up and fly off with you. This will lead to The Destined One learning to use Wukong's Somersault Cloud. To activate it, **press Down on the D-Pad or G if using a keyboard**. 

When the cutscene is over, you'll be at the edge of the cliff, so hop on to Somersault Cloud to get started exploring the area. 

### Secret Chest

![Foothills Walkthrough \(125\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/48/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28125%29.png) When you've got the Somersault Cloud ability, go back to the Verdant Path Keeper's Shrine. Facing away from the area where you fought The Supreme Inspector, hop into the cloud and fly forward. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(126\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b4/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28126%29.png)

You'll come back to the path where you first spawn into the level. Fly up and just above the start of the path, where you'll find a curved tree. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(127\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/90/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28127%29.png)

Land behind it and you'll find a chest. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(124\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/42/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28124%29.png)

Inside, it contains common versions of the Golden Feng-Tail Crown, Gold Suozi Armor, Dian-Cui Loong-Soaring Bracers, and Lotus Silk Cloudtreaders. 

Navigating the area to find all the bosses can be tricky, so we've suggested a route to take with the way we've listed bosses below. However, you can find these bosses at any time and tackle them in any order you wish (except for the Emeraled-Armed Mantis, which must be done last out of the main bosses). It’s also worth noting that you’ll go up against various bosses and mini-bosses that use some of the four banes, so you may want to swap your gear, curios, and spirits regularly. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(128\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2d/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28128%29.png)

From the edge of the cliff, look straight down to see a pool of water. Go down and to the center of this water to fight our first optional boss, Jiao-Loong of Waves. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Jiao-Loong of Waves

![Foothills Walkthrough \(119\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/98/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28119%29.png)

Jiao-Loong of Waves has a limited moveset, so you can quickly pick up on the attack patterns. It will mainly use its tale to try and whip you, either by spinning or flipping around to catch you with it. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(112\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f1/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28112%29.png)

As well as this, it will lunge and swipe at you, and occasionally sidestep or leap up and pounce on you in an attempt to bite you. With all of these attacks, simply dodging or jumping back should be enough to keep you out of harm's way. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(122\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/57/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28122%29.png)

You can generally stay close to this boss, but just watch out for its roar that will stun you for a few seconds. To combat Jiao-Loong of Waves, you'll want to use heavy attacks. It's not so steady on its feet, so you can easily knock it over or at least temporarily stun it. This will give you longer periods of time to give it a beatdown without interruption. If you use the Plantain Fan here, it'll be constantly knocked down on the floor, giving you even more time to attack. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(111\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0a/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28111%29.png)

When its health has been knocked down past the halfway mark, it will start to dive into the water where you won't be able to reach it. It will move underneath the surface to try and dive up and attack you. Look for where the water is rippling to work out where it'll emerge. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(123\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d9/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28123%29.png)

It will dive in and out a few times, then its huge tail will appear from the water to try and hit you. This will appear almost tentacle-like, and there can be overlap which means you're dodging more than one at once. 

Thankfully, with a limited range of attacks and a fairly straightforward way to avoid them, Jiao-Loong of Waves shouldn't require too much to take it down. Don't feel the need to conserve your spells during this fight; take advantage of them to quickly take down this miniboss. 

Jiao-Loong of Waves

![Foothills Walkthrough \(129\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5a/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28129%29.png)

With your first optional miniboss defeated, it's time to work on clearing out the rest of the Foothills. From the area where you fought Jiao-Loong of Waves, ascend and look to the left. You should be able to see another body of water here, on a higher part of the cliff. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(133\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/86/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28133%29.png)

On the opposite side of the water, there's a clearing, with what appears to be a big rock sitting by the edge of it. This is actually one of the Poison Chiefs in the area, so fly over to it to tackle your next miniboss. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 1

You only need to kill one Poison Chief to unlock the journal entry, but there are four in the area, so we’ve included information on how to find each one below.

If you're not using a general build, be sure to equip gear, curios, and spirits that give you Poison Resistance. Though this is another boss with a limited moveset, it can be easy to die to the Poison Chiefs if you're not careful. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(113\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7c/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28113%29.png)

You can expect it to throw out little orbs of poison continuously, covering the surrounding area and inflicting Poison Damage. Equip Antimiasma Powder so you can quickly use it if you get caught in one too many attacks. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(116\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/db/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28116%29.png)

Just like stone bosses and the flint bosses from Chapter 5, most of the attacks from the Poison Chief will be charges and slams. It will try to use the weight of its body to attack while delivering smatterings of poison around the area. 

Its charges can be avoided, by dashing out of the way just before it reaches you. A similar approach can be applied to dealing with its lunges and punches. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(115\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/56/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28115%29.png)

The biggest issue is the poison attacks, and it's essential to interrupt them as often as you can. The Plantain Fan can prove invaluable here once again, especially if you deploy it just before a poison attack. It will push the Poison Chief back and allow you to follow up with attacks. Use Immobilize when the Plantain Fan has stopped working, to keep it in place and deplete its health as quickly as possible. 

Poison Chief 1

![Foothills Walkthrough .png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d3/Foothills_Walkthrough_.png)

When the Poison Chief is down, fly up and continue left toward the water. Go almost to the end of the water, where you should see a giant creature. When you get close to it, it will leap in the air and jump to a nearby rock. Fly over to it, then land on its head. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Feng-Tail General

![Foothills Walkthrough \(24\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3e/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2824%29.png)

The boss fight against the Feng-Tail General is more of a skill check than anything, testing out whether you've got the necessary health and stamina to continue. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(30\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c5/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2830%29.png)

Firstly, it will test your stamina. When you approach it near the Mantis-Catching Swamp, and land on its head you'll need to approach its antennae. Interact with them and hold on. It will begin to jump around the water, eventually ending up near the Rhino Watch Slope. Your stamina bar will drain as it does this, and you'll only be able to complete the test if it doesn't completely run out before the critter stops jumping. If you're finding it hard to hold on, reset some skills and ensure that Rampant Vigor is maxed out under Survival, and see if you've missed any Celestial Nonary Pill Locations. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(28\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d6/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2828%29.png)

The second test will be on your health bar, and particularly test your fire resistance. When the insect stops jumping, you'll be expected to interact with its flaming antennae. Before you do this, equip your Fireproof Mantle, and ensure you've maxed out your Bane Mitigation skill. Check to see if you have any other gear you can equip that helps with burn resistance, and see if you've missed any Celestial Jade Lotus Pill Locations. 

If you're able to hang on without dying, you'll snap the antennae from the insect and receive the Golden Feng-Tail Crown. 

Feng-Tail General

![Foothills Walkthrough \(29\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f6/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2829%29.png)

Now drop down from the Feng-Tail General and activate the nearby Keeper's Shrine. You'll see a field straight in front of you that's strewn with soldiers and fire. Before you head here, let's go find the second optional Poison Chief miniboss that's nearby. 

## Rhino Watch Slope

![Foothills Walkthrough \(135\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a5/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28135%29.png)

Facing the Keeper's Shrine, fly up from it and look to the right. Get as high as you can, and you'll see a large rock. Head straight toward it and over it, then continue past and turn slightly to the right again. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(136\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/96/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28136%29.png)

In the midst of the trees, there's a small patch of ground with no grass. The Poison Chief can be found here. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 2

Thankfully, each of the Poison Chief fights is pretty much the same. You can expect the same moveset and should prepare for them in the same way. 

Poison Chief 2

When the second Poison Chief is down, return to the Rhino Watch Slope and then head into the area with the flames on the ground. A cutscene will  out as you get there, and the Gold Armored Rhino will appear. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Gold Armored Rhino

![Foothills Walkthrough \(26\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0b/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2826%29.png)

The key to making this fight as easy as possible is to break the Rhino's horn. You want to do this as quickly as possible, so we'd recommend going in with the Wandering Wight Spirit equipped. Speed is essential here, as you'll need to hit the Rhino head-on to break the horn. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(27\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b2/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2827%29.png)

Once its horn is broken, it’ll try to get away from you. Use Immobilize if needed to keep the Rhino in place, then quickly use Wandering Wight to smash the horn. Follow this up with Pluck of Many and the Plantain Fan to knock the Rhino over repeatedly and overwhelm it with your duplicates. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(46\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/87/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2846%29.png)

When you can't use the Wandering Wight, you need to build focus quickly. Alternatively, just keep holding charge until you’ve built your focus up. If you’re building your focus up naturally, then it’s worth using Immobilize when it's ready again to get the Rhino to stand still so you'll have more chance of hitting your target. You don't want to waste your attacks in this, otherwise, you could be in for a lengthy fit. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(49\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e4/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2849%29.png)

Though you can do damage by hitting the Rhino in other areas, there’s little point in doing so unless you want the fight to last a long time. If you miss hitting the horn, you can still attack it. Avoid hitting its face and instead focus on hitting it from behind. This will annoy it, and it will buck to try and kick you with its back legs. 

But if you’re holding charge to build it up, wait until the Rhino is coming toward you or pauses for a moment, and then unleash the attack. One of the best times to hit is when it's moving slowly, with sparks appearing around its horn. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(48\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5e/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2848%29.png)

Unfortunately, it won't be very long until lots of lightning starts to appear around the Rhino. When this happens, it will rear up and more lightning will start to strike the ground all around the field. This means that the horn is about to regrow, and you'll need to prepare to break it again. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(44\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/18/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2844%29.png)

Beyond this, expect attacks where it will charge at you. There are rocks you can use in the arena to hide behind for a little while. However, once these are destroyed, you'll need to dodge out of the way. When it's close to you, it will also try to swipe at you by pulling its head back, then swinging it to the side to catch you with its horn. These are great moves to dodge and build up focus if you've unlocked the ability to do so in the skills tab. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(47\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/11/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2847%29.png)

Lastly, you can expect a few projectile attacks from the Rhino as well. When it puts its horn down to the ground and drags along it, it will flick rocks up at you. Usually, these are five rocks at a time and you can move out of the way of them easily if you're not too close to the Rhino. 

The fight is very much a rinse-and-repeat situation, where you'll just want to try and hit the horn as much as you can to try and break it. 

Gold Armored Rhino

After defeating the Golden-Armored Rhino you'll gain the Gold Suozi Armor, which is the second part of Wukong's Set. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(134\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28134%29.png)

Fly up again when the battle is done and head for the edge of the cliff (the opposite side to the Keeper's Shrine and where you entered the fight). 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(137\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9e/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28137%29.png)

When you get to the edge, look down to see a muddy clearing. Down here, you can find the next optional boss, which is the final frog Lang-Baw-Baw. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Lang-Baw-Baw

![Foothills Walkthrough \(36\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/89/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2836%29.png)

When you first drop in on Lang-Baw-Baw, a load of soldiers will also appear. You can ignore these and let Lang-Baw-Baw tackle them; they make for a good distraction so you can focus on hitting the frog while it attacks the soldiers. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(33\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/be/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2833%29.png)

When it comes to the one-to-one with Lang-Baw-Baw, you can expect to see the same type of moves that the previous frog bosses have used (if you've taken them all down so far). Expect to see it use its tongue as a whip to try and hit you, which you can dodge and dash away from. It will also leap up and try to belly flop you, as well as use its back kicks to quickly lash out when you're behind it. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(32\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/01/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2832%29.png)

The big difference with Lang-Baw-Baw is that you need to watch the color of its body to know when it's best to attack and in what way. When its body is red, it's vulnerable to attack. In this state, you'll do the most damage, so you'll want it to stay like this for as long as possible. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(37\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/be/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2837%29.png)

After a certain amount of time, he will solidify, turn brown, and become like stone. If you hit him during this state, your attacks will bounce off of him, though they will do minimal amounts of damage. When he's like this, he will start to use rocks to attack. He can also roar, which will momentarily stun you and damage you at the same time. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(31\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3a/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2831%29.png)

Expect to see him using rocks like shockwaves, where he'll punch the ground and disturb the ground underneath you, and also call rocks up into the air. When this happens, he'll roar and send them hurtling toward you. Another variation of a rock attack he performs is that a circle of rocks will spike up from the ground on occasion. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(38\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/98/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2838%29.png)

The key is to get him out of this state as soon as possible because it can be an annoying fight otherwise. It's easy to be killed when you're being bombarded with rock attacks in this phase. You can perform heavy attacks when he's in this phase, and you'll knock him flat and still do plenty of damage. But the best thing you can do is throw out the Plantain Fan. He'll go back to being red immediately, and be repeatedly pushed back. Stick close to him when the fan is hitting to keep attacking. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(34\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/70/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2834%29.png)

If he goes back into this state when you don't have the fan available, it's just a matter of hanging back and avoiding attacks until he changes back to red. 

Lang-Baw-Baw

![Foothills Walkthrough \(138\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b3/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28138%29.png)

When you've beaten Lang-Baw-Baw, fly up again and look to the opposite side of the water. You'll see red trees in the distance, but it's the area on the right you'll want to go to first. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 3

As you get close to the edge of the cliff, you'll find another clearing with a rock in the middle. This is the third Poison Chief in the region. 

Poison Chief 3

When you've beaten the third Poison Chief, head over to the start of the red trees. As you enter the clearing with the lightning, you'll find the next Keeper's Shrine on the left. 

## Deer Sight Forest

![Foothills Walkthrough \(139\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/65/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28139%29.png)

Activate the Deer Sight Forest Keeper's Shrine and go toward the lightning and red tree in the middle of the clearing. Underneath the tree sits the Cloudtreading Deer. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Cloudtreading Deer

![Foothills Walkthrough \(52\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1f/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2852%29.png)

The Cloudtreading Deer will try to put as much distance as possible between you, so you'll want to use spells like Immobilize to keep it in place or Cloudstep to catch up to it. There are two phases to this fight, and aggression is key in the first one, so you can get to the second phase in as little time as possible with spells left over. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(53\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8b/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2853%29.png)

It will start by attacking with its horns, sweeping at you to try and hit you. It will also rear up, and hold itself for a few seconds, before slamming down and sending out ripples of frost damage. If you get behind it, just like the Rhino, it will buck to kick you with its hind legs. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(57\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/75/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2857%29.png)

In this first phase, you'll want to have plenty of Body-Warming Powder, as the Cloudtreading Deer uses frost as its elemental attacks. But the most dangerous aspect of this first stage is the fact that the deer sends out lots of little tornadoes. While the small whirlwinds of ice are easy to dodge, these tornadoes are much harder to avoid and also signal when the deer will ramp up its attacks. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(58\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/38/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2858%29.png)

To make the first part of this fight easier, we'd recommend equipping the Wind Tamer as your vessel. It will wipe these tornadoes out as soon as you use it, and mean there's one less thing to focus on. The deer will still leap in the air and tread the clouds to attack you, but you won't need to worry about being hit by the annoying tornadoes. While this is useful once, you'll obviously need to wait for it to become available again, and in the meantime, the deer will continue to use this attack. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(54\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/14/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2854%29.png)

If you're taking it on without the vessel, the best thing you can do is get as far away from the tornadoes as possible and let the deer come to you. You'll be able to get a better look at it like this, while it jumps around in the air and prepares to slam into the ground. When it lands, dodge or jump to avoid the shockwave of frost, and then go all in on attacking the deer. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(61\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/65/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2861%29.png)

When it seems like the fight is over, it's just getting started and entering its second phase. Blood will spill from the deer and pool all around it. The blood will poison you, so you'll want Antimiasma Powder to help you deal with any damage that comes from it. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(51\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/18/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2851%29.png)

In this phase, you'll need to avoid the pools of blood. There are also some projectiles, where little orbs of blood will float up in the air and then hone in on you. Thankfully, you'll have a little bit of help with this one, as Zhu Bajie will appear in the second phase to give you a hand. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(63\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3d/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2863%29.png)

This part of the fight is more about managing how long you can stand in the blood for, and jumping back out when you're about to be completely poisoned. Try to bait the deer to run out of the patches of blood, and into the ice where you can attack it freely. You can also use the Wind Vessel in this phase to down the deer temporarily. 

Cloudtreading Deer

Once the Cloudtreading Deer is down, you'll receive the Lotus Silk Cloudtreaders, and it's time to continue the sweep of the mountain. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(140\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e2/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28140%29.png)

Head back to the Keeper's Shrine once you've defeated the deer. Fly up high again, and look straight ahead for another rocky part of the cliff. It'll be hard to see from here, but fly straight forward and you should see a distinctive tall white tree. Next to it is a clearing, where you can find the final Poison Chief. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Poison Chief 4

You know the drill with the Poison Chiefs at this stage, where heavy attacks, Immobilize, and the Plantain Fan can all help to make short work of it. Once you're done with the final one, hop back onto the Somersault Cloud. 

Poison Chief 4

Fly up and face toward the water. You'll be heading right along the river, to reach the next main boss. But before you go there, there's another optional boss to take care of. 

You can actually find multiple of the Water-Wood Beasts along the way, but there's only one where the health bar appears where you fight it, and it's much bigger than the others, which is why we've just included the one here. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Water-Wood Beast

![Foothills Walkthrough \(65\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/05/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2865%29.png)

To find the Water-Wood Beast, continue along the river, back toward where you first saw the Feng-Tail General. You're going to want to find where the river ends, which is where it widens and becomes a circle. It's to the left of the area where the Feng-Tail General was. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(141\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/be/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28141%29.png)

As you approach it, you should see a small lot of bubbles coming up from the center of it. When you get closer to it, the Water-Wood Beast will appear. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(68\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8f/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2868%29.png)

In general, you want to stick behind the beast as much as you can. It will try to lunge and bite at you if you face it head-on, so this removes some of the problem of dodging those attacks. Immobilize will also help you out here, as similar to the rhino, it will move around and you'll want to be able to take advantage of those frozen moments as much as possible. Though you will want to watch out for it bucking and kicking back. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(69\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/50/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2869%29.png)

This fight is where your transformations can really shine, particularly Red Tides. Because it's a wood beast, it's easy to set it on fire with Red Tides attacks. It's also useful to be able to use the heavy attack and dash forward to catch up with it. Once you've built enough focus, perform a heavy attack in Red Ties to knock it over and set it on fire. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(67\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/12/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2867%29.png)

You can then detransform and follow up with your own strong attacks and it will continue to burn for a while until it douses itself off with the water. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(70\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a6/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2870%29.png)

As its health starts to get low, it will dive into the water and behave similarly to Jiao-Loong of Waves, where it will try to dive up and catch you by surprise. You'll see it emerge and peek up before it disappears again and the ground begins to rumble. You'll be able to see ripples in the water, that show you the exact path the beast is taking to reach you. 

Water-Wood Beast

![Foothills Walkthrough \(143\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4a/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28143%29.png)

When it's defeated, head back along the river and look for the golden tree. 

## Mantis-Catching Swamp

Now that you've cleaned up the majority of the optional bosses, it's time to find the last of the main bosses. You need to have defeated the Feng-Tail General, Gold Armored Rhino, and Cloudtreading Deer before you can take on the Emerald-Armed Mantis. 

The golden tree will have a slight fog around it when you're able to fight the Emerald-Armed Mantis. Zoom toward the fog and you'll see that it glistens with green speckles. As you land by it a cutscene will begin. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Emerald-Armed Mantis

Zhu Bajie will be on the floor and pick up a mantis from the ground. It will hop inside Bajie's mouth, and you'll need to do the same to be able to fight the insect. You'll soon be transformed and literally entering the belly of the beast. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(77\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3d/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2877%29.png)

Note! If you die here, you'll be automatically transported back to near Zhu Bajie. There's a nearby Mantis-Catching Swamp that can also be activated, just behind where Bajie stands against the tree. To get back inside him, approach him and talk to him. 

Because the fight takes place inside Bajie's stomach, the area is limited. You'll find the mantis hacking and slashing away at the lining of Bajie's stomach, and it will soon turn its attention to you. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(79\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ae/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2879%29.png)

The first thing to take note of is the two blades it has for arms. It will use this to perform a combo of melee attacks, which mainly start with it raising both blades and stabbing them down into the pool of stomach contents you'll be wading through. As the blades land, this is a moment of vulnerability for the mantis, that will allow you to attack. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(78\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/37/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2878%29.png)

It will then start to use one blade at a time, and start to slash away. Occasionally, this will see the mantis spin around in a circle with the blades doing the same. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(95\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/91/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2895%29.png)

It's only when the mantis' health bar drops to around 70% that the fight changes drastically. A cutscene will  and the mantis will sharpen its blades, then dip them in the liquid, pulling them out so that they're now red. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(97\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/21/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2897%29.png)

The mantis will now become quite erratic with its movements, flipping all around the stomach. Immobilize will help out with this, but so will the Plantain Fan, which will push the Mantis back to a part of the stomach and pin it there for you to attack. It will also stop it from being able to fly too much in the air. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(104\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d9/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28104%29.png)

Along with these attacks, the mantis will sometimes fly up and start to slash its blades, but send out projectiles instead. Its combos will become more agile, and it will often spin around again and again with its blades creating circles around it. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(102\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/eb/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28102%29.png)

Transformations are also useful here, and we found that Red Tides proved handy once again. The mantis is susceptible to burn damage, so it will chip away at its health bar while you follow up with attacks. 

When the mantis is dead, you'll receive Dian-Cui Loong-Soaring Bracers. With all the main bosses finished, for now, it's time to follow Zhu Bajie up the mountain. On the way though, there are just two more optional bosses to capture to wrap up this portion of the Chapter. 

Emerald-Armed Mantis

![Foothills Walkthrough \(142\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c8/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28142%29.png)

From the Mantis-Catching Swamp, fly up and back toward the area where you fought the Gold Armored Rhino and Cloudtreading Deer. We now want to stop on the left, to get the Son of Stones, which is the boss sitting at the edge of the cliff on the left with the neon blue glow. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Son of Stones

Land behind the Sone of Stones on the cliff and then attack to start the fight. He won't immediately jump up, so you can get a couple of free hits in. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(72\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/47/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2872%29.png)

When he does join in, you'll want to watch out for the standard stone boss attack of swiping at you with one hand. In the Son of Stones's case, he will fall over, but will continue to roll toward you, which will damage you if you're hit by it. At the end of this attack, he has to get himself back up, so quickly Immobilize him when he's down to take advantage of the situation. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(75\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b1/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2875%29.png)

Unlike other stone bosses, the Son of Stones mostly uses an elemental attack. The blue glow coming from him is in fact a charge, and he will throw out projectiles or summon waves of lightning to crash down around him. Have Shock-Quelling Powder equipped to combat any lightning damage he might inflict. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(74\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/36/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2874%29.png)

When the lighting attacks begin, get as far away from them as possible. He will start to lift his arms up and the lightning will get more intense, eventually ending in an explosion. As he does this, he will knock himself out and fall to the ground. The recovery from this attack takes a while, so dash at him and attack as much as you can. Here's a good opportunity to use Pluck of Many to maximize the time he's down for. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(71\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d7/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2871%29.png)

When he gets back up, use the Plantain Fan to stagger him and remove the lightning attacks and then folow up. 

Son of Stones

![Foothills Walkthrough \(73\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Foothills_Walkthrough_%2873%29.png)

When the Sone of Stones is down, there's just one more boss to take care of, which is a secret Yoaguai King. To be able to summon it, you'll need to have collected the Skandhas through the previous Chapters. If you haven't already got your hands on these Skandhas, follow our guide to collecting them all here. 

Go to the clearing behind where you fought the Son of Stones, just off to the left. You'll see some water, a large rock to the left of it, and two golden trees on either side of the rock. 

You want to go to the right of the water to find the secret area that will take you to the hidden boss. 

![Five Skandhas \(21\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fc/Five_Skandhas_%2821%29.png)

You'll need to ascend quite high up, but where the path reaches a dead end, up above there's an opening in the cliff that you can pass through. Follow this until you enter an area that's slightly covered and pass through this tunnel. 

![Five Skandhas \(24\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/82/Five_Skandhas_%2824%29.png)

As you emerge in the wide open space, a Giant Shigandang will appear. 

### Yaoguai King - Giant Shigandang

![Five Skandhas \(26\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/00/Five_Skandhas_%2826%29.png)

Unfortunately, despite its size, you will need to be on foot during the fight. The key to defeating this enormous rocky monster is to head for its fits and attack the blue crystals you can on them. 

![Five Skandhas \(22\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e8/Five_Skandhas_%2822%29.png)

Its main attack is to punch down with its giant fists, which unsurprisingly, will one-shot you if you're hit by them. The easiest way to avoid them is to just back up as far away from them as possible. Then, once the Giant Shigandang pauses punching, run up to the fists and keep hitting the blue crystals. 

The other attack that the Shigandang does is to punch both fists down and send out ripples. Again, you want to hang back as much as you can. The rings will come toward you, and you can jump over them to avoid them. There are times when he'll raise both hands in the air, and seem like he's about to perform this attack, but instead, he's actually going to slam his fists down and just lay there for a bit. This is the perfect time to get in close and attack him. 

![Five Skandhas \(25\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/71/Five_Skandhas_%2825%29.png)

After defeating the boss, climb the arm that touches the ground and you'll meet the monkey again. Let the cutscene  and you'll get the Skandha of Consciousness. 

Giant Shigandang

## How to Use the Five Skandhas

![Five Skandhas .png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2e/Five_Skandhas_.png)

With all five in your inventory, go to Xu Dog and deliver the Skandhas. You'll then have the option to tell Xu Dog to make the Five Skandhas Pill. Receiving this will boost your health, mana, and stamina.

![Foothills Walkthrough \(144\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/15/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28144%29.png)

Now it's time to head back to almost where you fought the Son of Stones. We mentioned earlier the clearing with the water and the big rock with golden trees on either side. Instead of going right, where you fought the Giant Shigandang, you now want to go left. 

![Foothills Walkthrough \(145\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2b/Foothills_Walkthrough_%28145%29.png)

You'll see a waterfall in the distance and an archway just before it. Go down to this archway and head inside, where you'll automatically dismount from the cloud. This will take you into Water Curtain Cave, which is the final area of the game. 

Foothills Complete
