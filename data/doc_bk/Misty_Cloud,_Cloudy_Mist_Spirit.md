## Misty Cloud, Cloudy Mist Fight

The Misty Cloud, Cloudy Mist fight can be difficult since there are two foes to contend with. Thankfully, they usually take turns fighting you, so you won't be tackling both of them at once for the entire fight. As you're fighting one, the other will eventually pop up, leaving the first to disappear for a while so you can focus on the second. There will be times, however, when they will both be present, so keep your eyes peeled. 

Cloudy Mist is the first enemy you will encounter in this fight. Cloudy Mist has a large staff that deals ice damage and creates thin laser beams of light that track you around the arena. He can also summon white balls of ice that follow and bombard you if you get caught in their path. 

Misty Cloud is the second foe that will appear. His weapon of choice is a burning log of incense that he swings around, usually in sets of three. Dodge each swing until the combo is complete before rushing in to land your own hits.

  * **Torch Aloft**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately reduces the Mana cost of Cloud Step.

Misty Cloud and Misty Step's Spirits allow you to take the form of both enemies. First, you will embody Misty Cloud and swing his giant log of incense at your enemies before switching over to Cloudy Mist and unleashing three beams of light to pelt them. These moves are very strong, especially considering there are two of them. The equipped effect is also handy if you frequently use Cloud Step. Channeling Misty Cloud and Cloudy Mist reduces the Mana cost of the spell, allowing you to use that and your other spells more before running out of Mana.
