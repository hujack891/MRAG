## Where to Find Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang

You can encounter this miniboss while exploring the large area partway through the Bamboo Grove in Snake Trail. From the Shrine, you can either head up and over the bridge, or jump through a grove of bamboo left of the shrine to reach a stream.

Follow the stream upriver near the ramp and stick to the left to find a marshy area full of white reed flowers, and the boss will leap out of its lair to attack. 

### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang

A gargantuan Yaoguai Toad, Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang will waste no time leaping into battle with a powerful slam attack from the air. While he doesn’t have many moves, they can often land extremely quickly, which means you’ll need to be ready to dodge at any moment.

His most standard attack includes a series of swipes with both arms that sends him forward, ending in a small leaping splash attack that allows him to reposition. By dodging the first swipe to the side, you can wait for him to leap back towards you and then use Immobilize to keep in place while you attack. He can also use any of these swipes and slams independently as well as in a three-hit combo, so look for a follow-up attack before deciding to commit to countering with your own attacks.

There are two extremely fast and damaging attacks you’ll need to beware of. The first comes when he’s directly facing you, and the toad will pause momentarily lowering his arms across his chest. He’ll then lunge at you belly first in an extremely quick dash, and you’ll have to dodge the body slam quickly to the side before striking back.

Be wary when dodging around to his back, or when you see him reposition himself by hopping and turning his body. Instead of landing from the hop, he’ll spring out his legs with surprising reach to perform a frog leg kick with massive power, and can use it twice in a row!

Finally, he can unleash a tongue attack that sweeps back and forth with a large reach several times, and will require you to dodge back and forth out of its path — or use your Immobilize to stop him in the act. Using your Red Tide spell to transform can also help out during these attacks as he’ll be vulnerable to getting hit from the side.

When Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang finally falls, he’ll leave behind his purple Spirit and a Tadpole Material. Using your new Blessed Gourd upgrade, you can now absorb the Spirit and add Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang’s power to your own, and temporarily transform to unleash a tongue attack against several enemies. If you decide to commit to cultivating his spirit and upgrading its damage potential, you can use the Tadpole he dropped to further upgrade it later on.
