# Gold Sun Crow

The Gold Sun Crow is one of the many Curios items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. 

With the Gold Sun Crow equipped your damage is slightly increased from it. This effect is boosted with the Jade Moon Rabbit also equipped. 

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Gold Sun Crow Location

The Gold Sun Crow can be found in the secret Purple Cloud Mountain area of The Webbed Hollow. It is in a chest up a log which you can climb up to reach a rock high above the area.
