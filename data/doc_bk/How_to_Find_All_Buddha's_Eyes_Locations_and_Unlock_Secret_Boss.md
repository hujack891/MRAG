# How to Find All Buddha's Eyes Locations and Unlock Secret Boss

Chapter 2 of Black Myth: Wukong contains a secret boss that can only be unlocked by collecting 6 Key Items. These are Buddha's Eyeballs and can be found in statues across Fright Cliff. On this page, you can find a breakdown of where to find each of the eyes, and where you need to deposit them to find the secret boss. 

## How to Find All Buddha's Eyes

In Chapter 2, you’ll come to the Fright Cliff and the Squall Hideout Keeper’s Shrine. Before you reach it, you’ll hear chanting, and see the glowing eyes in a Buddha Head that lays in the sand. Interacting with the Buddha Head will give you the Buddha Eyes Key Item, but there are actually more to find dotted around the landscape. 

Here’s how to find them all: 

  * Buddha’s Eyes 1
  * Buddha’s Eyes 2
  * Buddha’s Eyes 3
  * Buddha’s Eyes 4
  * Buddha’s Eyes 5
  * Buddha’s Eyes 6

### Buddha’s Eyes 1

As you enter Fright Cliff from Sandgate Village, make your way up the hill toward the Squall Hideout Keeper’s Shrine. Before you reach it, you’ll go past the chanting Buddha Head on your right. Each one of the Buddha Heads has glowing yellow eyes. Interact with it to remove the Buddha’s Eyeball.

### Buddha’s Eyes 2

From the Squall Hideout Keeper’s Shrine, go right. If you look immediately to the left past the wall, you’ll see a set of stairs, and in the distance, a wooden structure. This is where you’ll want to go, to find the next head.

Go over to the other side and climb up the stairs. Take out the enemies using ranged attacks, and climb to the very top of the structure to find the Buddha Head.

### Buddha’s Eyes 3

Look down from the top of the structure where you found the Buddha’s Eyeball 2, and you’ll see the third one waiting for you down below.

### Buddha’s Eyes 4

If you’re facing the third Buddha Head, you can either: 

  * Go left and backtrack on yourself, then take the first right.
  * Go right and continue up the path, then take a sharp left up a set of stairs.

Both paths will merge, leading to an open space with a stone enemy.

On the other side, you’ll see a wooden structure, and a path that goes into a cave. Head in here and look for the statue on the left. Take this turning first, to find a Buddha Head at the end with a Poisestone enemy.

Buddha’s Eyeball 4

### Buddha’s Eyes 5

Turn back on yourself, and take the path in the cave that goes in the opposite direction. You’ll come to a small body of water, but what you’ll probably first notice is the wooden structure and the enemies using ranged attacks on the right. Across from the body of water is a large opening, that will take you to Rockrest Flatt. But there’s actually another small path off to the left, with a set of stairs that leads up to a boss encounter with Mother of Stones.

Head right up to the top, and look for an opening where the sunlight comes in on the right. On the left, you’ll see the large stone structure of the Mother of Stones. Go outside and you’ll see the Buddha Head in the distance.

Buddha’s Eyeball 5

### Buddha’s Eyes 6

Go back down the stairs to the body of water, and take the left out to the Rockrest Flat where you’ll find another Keeper’s Shrine. From the Keeper’s Shrine, go left and you’ll see the final Buddha Head. When you have all 6, chanting will begin letting you know you have everything you need.

## How to Use the Buddha’s Eyeballs to Unlock the Secret Boss

Go right from the final Buddha Head (closest to Rockrest Flat Keeper’s Shrine) and then proceed through the doorway just to the right of it. As you enter, you’ll see a large rock to the left. Upon closer inspection, it has multiple faces that sit in the rock.

If you haven’t got all 6 of the Buddha Eyes, when you go toward it and examine it, will say:_"Bound by six seals, eternally confined. In yellow earth, the evil’s fate entwined."_

When you have all 6 of the Budda Eyes, the prompt for Deliver will appear. Doing so will enter the Buddha’s Eyeballs into the rock and a secret boss Shigandang will appear.

### Secret - Defeat the Stone Vanguard with the Shigandang

![Wukong Shigandang 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/eb/Wukong_Shigandang_1.jpg)  
If you find yourself having trouble with the Stone Vanguard, it is possible to get some assistance from the Shigandang in an unexpected way!  
![Wukong Shigan Secret1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/49/Wukong_Shigan_Secret1.jpg)

If you haven't yet defeated the Stone Vanguard on your own but have found all six Buddha Eyeballs, you can actually summon the Shigandang before engaging the Stone Vanguard. When summoned early, he will arise and immediately fight with the Stone Vanguard. The good news is he's a lot tougher than the Stone Vanguard, and will perform a flashy finisher to tear the other rock Guai to pieces, giving you all the rewards!  
Of course, after defeating the Stone Vanguard, the Shigandang will immediately turn on you, and might be too tough to fight early if you were having problems defeating the Vanguard on your own!
