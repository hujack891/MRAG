# Fruit of Dao

The Fruit of Dao is one of the Rare Soaks for your Gourds in Black Myth: Wukong. 

With the Tender Jade Lotus Soak equipped, using the gourd moderately extends the duration of your invincibility upon executing a Dodge for a short duration. 

Soaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Fruit of Dao Location

The Fruit of Dao Soak is randomly dropped from Fly-Whisk Daoist enemies within The Webbed Hollow. Simply farm these kills around the Temple of Yellow Flowers until it drops.

Soaks are far more plentiful than the drinks for your gourds. They are scattered throughout the game, across each chapter. For even more guides on these areas, check out our full Black Myth: Wukong walkthrough. You can also keep track of the Awaken Wine Worm locations and Luoija Fragrant Vine locations, which are key to upgrading your healing potential and Gourd.
