# Buddha's Left Hand

Buddha's Left Hand is one of the unique materials in Black Myth: Wukong. It is used for weapon and armor crafting to craft unique gear unlocked upon defeating a boss. 

The Buddha's Left Hand can be used to craft a Gourd upgrade at the Shen Monkey Vendor in the Zodiac Village. 

To obtain the Buddha's Left Hand, you need to defeat Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw in the Lower Hollow in The Webbed Hollow.
