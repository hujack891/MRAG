# Sweet Ice

The Sweet Ice Soak is an Uncommon Soak Soaks for your Gourds in Black Myth: Wukong. The Soak's ability is particularly useful within The New West. 

With the Sweet Ice Soak equipped, using the gourd moderately increases Chill Resistance for a short duration. 

Soaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Sweet Ice Location

The Sweet Ice Soak can be found in New Thunderclap Temple in The New West, specifically at the Temple Entrance Shrine. From the Shrine, follow the path to the middle-right and through the red building's opening to get to the main plaza. 

Continue onwards, sticking to the right, and head through another red building's opening. Go up the staircase, and take a right, and another right to see a building just in front of you.

Soaks are far more plentiful than the drinks for your gourds. They are scattered throughout the game, across each chapter.

You can also keep track of the Awaken Wine Worm locations and Luoija Fragrant Vine locations, which are key to upgrading your healing potential and Gourd.
