## Puppet Tick Location

The Puppet Tick can be found near the Relief of the Fallen Loong. To get there, start by defeating the Buddha's Right Hand. Run over the bridge it creates and drop to the platform below. Turn right and head over the rope bridge on the left. Make your way past the hanging webs over the next rope bridge and escape to the forest. 

Cast Cloud Step on the bridge to make it past the hanging web sacks!

Activate the Relief of the Fallen Loong Keeper's Shrine and head left to explore the cave. Follow the path to the right in the cave to find the Puppet Tick. 

## Puppet Tick Fight

The Puppet Tick fights with its staff like all other enemies of its type. There are a few other enemies to contend with at the same time, so cast Immobilize or A Pluck of Many to help deal with the others so you can focus on the Puppet Tick.

  * **Bursting Spiders**
  * Equipped Effect: Considerably reduces the Mana cost for A Pluck of Many.

The Puppet Tick's Spirit allows you to take the form of the hunched-over beetle and summon two spider minions to attack your enemies alongside you. These spiders explode into a puff of poison, inflicting any foes who were standing a little too close. The equipped effect is very good in this case, reducing the Mana cost for A Pluck of Many. A Pluck of Many uses a good chunk of Mana, more than many other spells. If you use it a lot, this Spirit could be very useful.
