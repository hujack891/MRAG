# Tiger Tendon Belt

The Tiger Tendon Belt is one of the many Curios items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. 

With the Tiger Tendon Belt equipped you are able to briefly see through the enemy and increase your attack. 

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out.
