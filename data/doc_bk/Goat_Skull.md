# Goat Skull

Goat Skull is one of the Soaks for your Gourds that can be found throughout Black Myth: Wukong. It can be quite easy to miss if you aren't exploring thoroughly. But, the buff it offers is definitely useful for those looking for a pick-me-up in the middle of a fight. 

With the Goat Skull equipped, using the Gourd moderately increases maximum health for a short duration. This duration is rather brief, but in the middle of a fight or when at low health, it can give you an extra buffer beyond your regular health to either be more aggressive, or flee and take out an enemy or two on the way.

Soaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd itself, so you are stuck with the length of this health boost. It can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, be sure to visit the Shen Monkey Vendor throughout your game to continue equipping new ones. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Goat Skull Location

The Goat Skull can be found at random by picking up Licorice") plants. There isn't a set location or spot, you will just need to search for the purple Licorice plants throughout the game's chapters and hope that it drops for you. Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge has the most, especially in the early Sandgate Village area.

It isn't a super rare drop, so chances are you should find the Goat Skull quickly in Chapter 2. 

Soaks are far more plentiful than the Drinks for your Gourds. They are scattered throughout the game, across each chapter.

You can also keep track of the Awaken Wine Worm locations and Luoija Fragrant Vine locations, which are key to upgrading your healing potential and Gourd.
