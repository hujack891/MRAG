## The Webbed Hollow

![Wukong Lanxi 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/66/Wukong_Lanxi_1.jpg)

You'll awaken in this new realm hiding inside an offering chest for a mysterious "Lady", being carried to The Webbed Hollow by two Yaoguai. Eventually, your fiend Zhu Bajie will grow tired of hiding, but before you can bust out, a mysterious woman will eliminate the two Wushan Lesser Guai. 

![Wukong Lanxi 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9e/Wukong_Lanxi_2.jpg)

Once you're able to take stock of your new surroundings, you'll find yourself on the outskirts of a village under cover of night. Before heading onward, you may want to backtrack up the hill you were carried down, as you'll find a free green Wisp to absorb in the shack at the top, plus a Monkey-Head Mushroom to harvest. 

![Wukong Lanxi 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e2/Wukong_Lanxi_3.jpg)

Making your way past the scattered homes, the place is eerily quiet, but you can find a few other plants to harvest. Head through the wooded area to find another green Wisp, and you may notice a body hiding up in the trees. 

![Wukong Lanxi 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6f/Wukong_Lanxi_4.jpg)

Down will drop a Puppet Spider, a Yaoguai that likes to ambush and stab at you with its many legs. Luckily, you'll have Zhu Bajie on your side once more, and overwhelming lone opponents will be an easy task. They can spew poison from a distance, so watch yourself that you don't have to waste any Antimiasma potions this early. 

![Wukong Lanxi 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/73/Wukong_Lanxi_5.jpg)

As you approach the entrance to the village, you can spot two paths - a main one directly ahead, and a side path leading to the left down some stairs. You can also check out a small stream to the right with more plants to harvest in and around the water, and a green Wisp to absorb (it's guarded by another Puppet Spider). 

In fact, this town is teeming with green Wisps of all sizes, which means you'll have a lot of these little spirits to absorb to gain both will and some of your Gourd charges back in a pinch. 

![Wukong Lanxi 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/19/Wukong_Lanxi_6.jpg)

Take the main path first to find a few enemies up ahead, and an open shack on the right where the dim glow of another green Wisp can be seen. Be wary, as there's another Puppet Spider hiding in the shadows waiting for you to try and absorb the spirit! 

Approach the enemy holding the lanterns cautiously, as the other side of the shack you investigated hides an archer who will try to ambush you once you engage the other foe. 

![Wukong Lanxi 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5f/Wukong_Lanxi_7.jpg)

This Dragonfly Guai will fire off poison arrows at a measured pace, which are an unfortunate pairing with the fiery hostile wisps the Lantern Holder can create, alongside his equally poisonous sickle. 

![Wukong Lanxi 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/83/Wukong_Lanxi_8.jpg)

Once they've been defeated, look for some stairs left of the lantern decorations, and head to the lower level. There's many more green Wisps to absorb, so long as you take out the other Lantern Holder creating more dangerous wisps of his own. 

At the end of this lower path with the five green Wisps scattered about, there's a innocuous looking chest sitting in front of a small shack, but when you try to claim it, you'll be ambushed by a swarm of small Stone Spiders. 

![Wukong Lanxi 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5d/Wukong_Lanxi_9.jpg)

These little enemies are surprisingly durable, and can often come in waves. You'll really need to keep a close eye on them -- if you spot them begin to vibrate rapidly, they'll all explode at once, and getting hit by several exploding spiders can deal a ton of damage if you aren't paying attention. 

Once all the waves of Stone Spiders are dealt with, loot the **Treasure Chest** for a Blood of the Iron Bull and some random materials. 

Head back up to the main path, and be sure to check behind the small shack where the Dragonfly Guai was positioned to find a Lingzhiling hiding in the earth disguised as a mushroom to harvest. 

![Wukong Lanxi 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8d/Wukong_Lanxi_11.jpg)

Just past the lantern decorations, you'll encounter a new enemy: the Beetle Captain. These foes are tougher than the others in this area, and move deftly with twin swords for dual slashes or pincer-like stab attacks. They can also rapidly reorient themselves by flying backward after an attack, but you can Immobilize them to keep the foe pinned down. 

![Wukong Lanxi 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4d/Wukong_Lanxi_12.jpg)

Once the captain falls (and watch for another Puppet Spider nearby, you can check around the back of the house to the left to find another green Wisp guarded by a Puppet Spider hanging from the tree above. 

![Wukong Lanxi 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cb/Wukong_Lanxi_13.jpg)

From here, look around to find two paths to take: A narrow walkway over a stream below, and another open path past a building to the right. 

Take the path on the right first, but first look for a small building next to the narrow path where you'll find another **Treasure Chest** inside, guarded by more Stone Spiders that will burrow up to ambush you. 

![Wukong Lanxi 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bc/Wukong_Lanxi_14.jpg)

Head down the sloping street and grab a green Wisp along the way, and you'll find yourself crossing a small bridge to a clearing with a shack covered in webs. Standing our front are two Grasshopper Guai that can strike extremely quickly, but aren't as durable as the Beetle Captain. 

Clear them out with Zhu Bajie's help, and you'll find they were guarding a large **Treasure Chest** holding several consumables, which may include a Loong Aura Amplification Pellet, as well as a Knot of Voidness and Blood of the Iron Bull. 

## Estate of the Zhu

Return back to the narrow pathway over the other part of the stream -- grabbing the two green Wisps along the way -- where Zhu Bajie will likely warn of an ambush. 

![Wukong Lanxi 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fe/Wukong_Lanxi_16.jpg)

He's not wrong, as a Grasshopper Guai is waiting right at the edge of the roof as you pass under it, so be ready for an enemy to drop from above with a downward stab attack. 

![Wukong Lanxi 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e1/Wukong_Lanxi_18.jpg)

Ahead will be a large field full of cobwebs strung from various trees. You can find a Lantern Holder patrolling further back by an archway, and a small shack to the left with a **Treasure Chest** where another Grasshopper Guai will ambush you outside, and Stone Spiders will burrow up inside by the chest. 

![Wukong Lanxi 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/86/Wukong_Lanxi_19.jpg)

Just outside the shack, there's a small garden area with yet more Stone Spiders, and a Mushroom you can try to harvest only to reveal a formidable Fungiman instead. 

![Wukong Lanxi 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Wukong_Lanxi_17.jpg)

To the right, another Dragonfly Guai will try to pepper you with arrows from a high ledge, but you'll also want to check the far left corner past the archway for the Estate of the Zhu Shrine. 

When resting at this shrine, it's a good time to remind yourself that you can start amassing resources to craft both the Golden Armor Set from beating Yellowbrow, and the Spikeshaft Staff. You should also plan to revisit the Zodiac Village, as both the Xu Dog and Shen Monkey will have new wares to sell (plus you may have better equipment to challenge the Yin Tiger if you haven't already). 

Finally, with the start of a new chapter, the Shrines here hold new items to buy in the shop: 

Webbed Hollow Shrine Shop   
---  
Antimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |   
Mind Core (x4) - 2400 Will | Cold Iron Leaves (x4) - 900 Will | Fine Gold Thread (x2) - 3000 Will | Refined Iron Sand (x2) - 1200 Will   
Gold Tree Core (x1) - 4500 Will | | |   
Licorice (x5) - 120 Will | Fragrant Jade Flower (x5) - 120 Will | Gentian (x5) - 90 Will | Withered Silkworm (x3) - 240 Will   
Snake-Head Mushroom (x10) - 120 Will | | |   
  
![Wukong Lanxi 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/81/Wukong_Lanxi_20.jpg)

Just up the stairs from the Shrine is a door, so once you've made all your purchases, upgraded gear, and given the Zodiac Village another visit, you can try knocking on the door. 

Zhu Bajie will suggest a bit of subterfuge, disguising yourselves as the Wushan Lesser Guai who were hauling the chest at the start of the chapter. You'll be met by a shrewd woman, who will immediately figure out the little pig's disguise. She happens to have a disguise of her own, and will transform into her true self. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - The Second Sister

Taking the form of a giant venomous spider, The Second Sister isn't the toughest boss you'll have faced thus far, but her many legs can sometimes make her movements and attacks hard to read. Luckily, with Zhu Bajie on your side, you'll be able to team up and keep her on the defensive. Make use of the Shrine's store to stock up on Antimiasma Powder. 

![Wukong Lanxi 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a8/Wukong_Lanxi_21.jpg)

Most of The Second Sister's main attack will come from her two front razor-sharp legs, and will be where you will want to focus the bulk (but not all) of your attention. She may often begin the fight by raising up one talon high up to the side, slice down with her two front legs in quick succession, and then rise up into the air to slam down after a delay. 

Another move she can use at close range is to raise most of her body up on her back legs, and dance down upon you with her front talons to stab the ground multiple times in quick succession. Since it's hard to evade each blow individually, consider using the Thrust Stance to retreat and strike from a distance. 

![Wukong Lanxi 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f0/Wukong_Lanxi_22.jpg)

When she follows up her mad dance with a giant leap, roll forward to dodge under her slam, and you'll be able to pivot and unleash an attack of your own. 

![Wukong Lanxi 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/16/Wukong_Lanxi_23.jpg)

She has a particularly damaging attack where she'll extend both front legs far to the sides, and you'll be able to spot a gleam along them before she thrusts both legs together in a pincer strike. Time it right by using Rock Solid when you spot the legs gleam, and you can knock her back. 

![Wukong Lanxi 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7f/Wukong_Lanxi_25.jpg)

However, if you don't see the legs gleam when she spreads them wide, it will be a feint attack, and she'll quickly raise a single talon high that will gleam alone, before slamming it down on your position. 

![Wukong Lanxi 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4f/Wukong_Lanxi_24.jpg)

When she starts growling while taking a step back and shaking her body madly, that's your cue to retreat to a safe distance to avoid a spew of poison projectiles in the area in front of her. 

![Wukong Lanxi 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/07/Wukong_Lanxi_26.jpg)

The Second Sister also has a few unorthodox attacks that can be hard to spot, but easier to punish once you get the hang of them. One of these attacks will start as he twists her body away from you first, and then rapidly spins her body around while launching herself forward, and is better avoided than trying to deflect it. 

![Wukong Lanxi 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/01/Wukong_Lanxi_27.jpg)

Another move can often happen when trying to flank her or attack on other sides, as she'll simply raise her body up high, and then slam down to the ground to deal massive damage on all sides. 

![Wukong Lanxi 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/77/Wukong_Lanxi_28.jpg)

Finally, she can also perform a small leap and extend her front legs forward like spears as she lands, which may cause you to try and backpedal, only for her to follow up by shooting a quick projectile at you immediately afterward, which is both hard to spot and dodge. 

![Wukong Lanxi 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/12/Wukong_Lanxi_29.jpg)

Her moves can get even more unpredictable when she's low on health, often peppering in quick poison projectiles from her mouth, or somersaulting forward to slash at you. Continue to use the Thrust Stance to keep her talons at bay, and when having trouble, always look for when her front legs subtly shift their shape to become more distinct blades to know when the attack is coming. 

With Zhu Bajie backing you up (and you can always fall back to let him heal you), The Second Sister won't be able to stand against the two of you for long. After she's been defeated, she'll make a mad dash to flee, but not before flinging something at Zhu Bajie, who shrugs it off, and then runs ahead to chase her down. 

The Second Sister

Before you decide to give chase, let the little pig go and instead be sure to inspect the arena where you fought. 

![Wukong Lanxi 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/09/Wukong_Lanxi_30.jpg)

Go back and check the large building near the door you first came through, and you should be able to spot a glowing pot in the back of the room. Break it, and you'll reveal a new **Awaken Wine Worm** to add to your collection! 

The Estate of the Zhu Awaken Wine Worm

You can find some Fragrant Jade Flower to harvest in the corner of the arena, as well as another large area to the right with two **Treasure Chests** stashed away in opposite corners, and then follow your ally into the next area. 

![Wukong Lanxi 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/38/Wukong_Lanxi_31.jpg)

There's a large pit in the middle of this courtyard, but before you follow Zhu Bajie down, check the large altar on the other side of the pit, and you'll be able to claim a **Celestial Jade Lotus Pill** to increase your maximum health! 

The Webbed Hollow Celestial Jade Lotus Pill

![Wukong Lanxi 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f6/Wukong_Lanxi_32.jpg)

When you're ready to move to the next area, jump into the pit, only to find yourself taking a one way trip down to the true **Webbed Hollow** of this realm.
