# Sterness of Stone

Sterness of Stone is one of the main Key Items in Black Myth: Wukong's Yellow Wind Ridge area. It is a mandatory Key Item you will come across throughout the chapter, as you need it to progress towards the final boss: the Yellow Wind Sage.

The Sterness of Stone can be found at the Fright Cliff - Rockrest Flat Shrine. Just to the left, of the Shrine you can find a small arena. Once you enter it, you will fight the Stone Vanguard. Defeating it will drop the Sterness of Stone.

Before that, however, you can find out where the Sterness of Stone can be used below. 

## Where To Use The Sterness of Stone in Black Myth: Wukong

The Sterness of Stone can be used on the Tallies located in Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge. They allow you to access the path under the Crouching Tiger Temple, and open the locked doors at Sandgate Village - Valley of Despair and Yellow Sand Formation - Windrest Gate Shrines. You will need to use this with the Keeness of Tiger Key Item, which can be found at the Crouching Tiger Temple upon defeating the Tiger Vanguard. 

The first Tally is at the Crouching Tiger Temple, within the arena where you fought the Tiger Vanguard.

The second gate and final Tally is at the base of the sand slope onwards from the Fright Cliff - Rock Clash Platform Shrine, which is just after the Stone Vanguard fight.
