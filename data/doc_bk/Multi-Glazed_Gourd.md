# Multi-Glazed Gourd

The Multi-Glazed Gourd is one of the final Gourds you can obtain in Black Myth: Wukong during a first through. It comes with 6 uses and can't be upgraded, making it the Mythical Gourd with the lowest amount of uses. 

With the Multi-Glazed Gourd equipped, the Last Sip from the Gourd significantly increases attack for a short duration. This is a nice boost, but as you only get it once, the Gourd is easily outdone in terms of effectiveness by many other Gourds, including the Surpeme Gourd") which you should have by this point in the game in Chapter 6.

The Multi-Glazed Gourd can be purchased from the Shen Monkey Vendor in Black Wind Mountain, upon completing Chapter 5 in the Flaming Mountains. Once you start Chapter 6, you can head back to his location in Bamboo Grove and grab it for 18,000 Will.
