## Non-Pure Fight

Non-Pure is a heavy-set enemy armed with a large axe-like weapon tipped with a spike called a Monk's Spade. Most of the blows Non-Pure deals will be wide swipes with this Spade. These swipes have a very far reach, thanks to the sheer size of the weapon. He does wind up before swinging the axe around, giving you enough time to dodge out of the way.

  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Damage Reduction for a short duration after performing Rock Solid. 

Non-Pure's Spirit Power is a very strong one. His initial attack allows you to take his form and swing the long axe-like weapon around in circles for quite some time. The amount of swings you get out of this move is quite impressive and can deal a lot of damage. In addition to that, the equipped effect grants you more Damage Reduction after using the Rock Solid spell. Rock Solid is how you Parry in Black Myth: Wukong, so the spell is already excellent in its own right. Combined with Non-Pure, however, it's even better.
