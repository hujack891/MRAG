# The Spirit of Captain Lotus-Vision

The Spirit of Captain Lotus-Vision is one of the hidden Key Items in The New West. The item can be found after defeating Captain Lotus-Vision within the chapter. However, he is pretty hard to find, unless you know where he is.

The Spirit of Captain Lotus-Vision can be found in the Pagoda Realm in The New West. Specifically, right next to the Upper Pagoda Shrine. Once you spawn at the shrine, turn around and look down to find a small gap in the rocks with some enemies kneeling.

Drop down here to find Captain Lotus-Vision, whom you will need to defeat. He is a particularly tricky boss, but our Captain Lotus-Vision guide goes over everything you need to know to defeat him. 

One key tip, however, is to start the fight right when the alarm ends in the Pagoda Realm, which halves your health. That way, you can get through most, if not all, of the fight without losing a huge chunk of your survivability.

## Where To Use The Spirit of Captain Lotus-Vision in Black Myth: Wukong

The Spirit of Captain Lotus Vision isn't used. Instead, possession of it will cause the purple-sealed gates within the Pagoda Realm to unlock, allowing you to enter them to find secrets, gear, enemies, and even Ashen Slumber, one of the Transformation Spells.
