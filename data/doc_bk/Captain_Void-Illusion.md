# Captain Void-Illusion

Captain Void-Illusion is one of four "Captains" that you can encounter in Chapter 3 of Black Myth Wukong. Unlike the other Captains, Void-Illusion isn't actually a boss fight, but still has an important item to loot. 

  * **Rewards:** Spirit of Captain Void-Illusion

## Where to Find Captain Void-Illusion

You can find Captain Void-Illusion along the Road of Longevity in the Valley of Ecstasy. From the Shrine, head directly right and up the small hill past a large inacessible tower. You'll find a large corpse of some kind at the base of a statue built into the cliffs ahead.

This is actually one of the four Captains that the Pagoda Realm Prisoner spoke of, but it looks like someone beat you to putting this captain out of their misery. You can still interact with the body to claim the Spirit of Captain Void-Illusion. And hey, since they still count as a Yaoguai Chief in the journal, that's one less boss to worry about!
