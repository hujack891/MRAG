# Agate Jar

The Agate Jar is one of the Curios items you can find throughout Black Myth: Wukong. It is one of the strongest early-game Curios' thanks to its effect. 

With the Agate Jar equipped, you will get a flat-out, moderate defense buff, which is incredibly useful early on in the game.

The Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't enhance their buffs in any way. Therefore, if you find a better item for your build, you will want to switch the items out as soon as you can.
