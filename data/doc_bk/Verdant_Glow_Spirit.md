## Verdant Glow Location

Verdant Glow is in the secret area in Chapter 4 called Purple Cloud Mountain. To reach this area, you must first defeat the Venom Daoist in the chamber to the right of the Pool of Shattered Jade Keeper's Shrine. From there, revisit him again in an empty room on a path branching off to the right of the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Defeat him to unlock the secret area. 

Once you're on Purple Cloud Mountain, head down the path, past the snake, and to the right to find Verdant Glow. It is standing in front of a tree with a Luojia Fragrant Vine growing on it.

## Verdant Glow Fight

Verdant Glow has a couple of tricks up its leaves. Firstly, it can summon smaller tree minions to fight alongside it and distract you while it launches its own attacks, using its head to spin around in a circle. It also outstretches one leg while spinning around in an effort to knock you off your feet. 

Thankfully, Verdant Glow is so large that it is rather slow. This gives you plenty of time to land some hits while it's getting ready to launch another attack of its own.

  * Equipped Effect: Slowly recovers a small amount of Health. 

Verdant Glow's Spirit allows you to turn into a small sapling and slowly regain Health. If you activate tree-mode in water, you gain even more Health. The equipped effect is also designed to work in tandem with this and allows you to constantly and slowly regain a small amount of Health. This can be very handy for defensive builds.
