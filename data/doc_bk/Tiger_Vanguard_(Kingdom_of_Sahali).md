# Tiger Vanguard (Kingdom of Sahali)

The "Tiger Vanguard" is an optional Yaoguai Chief miniboss that you can encounter in Chapter 2's Secret Area in Black Myth Wukong. Not to be confused with his son, the Tiger Vanguard of the Crouching Tiger Temple, you can only reach this boss by unlocking the path to the Kingdom of Sahali, a secret area found beyond the Fright Cliff.

## Where to Find the "Tiger Vanguard"

The Kingdom of Sahali is a Chapter 2 Secret area that can only be accessed by meeting the Yellow-Robed Square in Fright Cliff (aka the Drunken Boar), and helping him in his search for the "Realm of Gold" which requires a few steps (and for you to best him in combat).

In order to unlock this secret area, you need to find the Drunk Boar (the Yellow-Robed Squire) who can be found in the Rockrest Flat part of the Fright Cliff region in Chapter 2. Head straight to the back of the area from the shrine to find a small breakable wooden fence protected by a Spearbone enemy.

In this large open field, you’ll find a friendly boar-like Guai resting on a rock. He’s apparently extremely inebriated, and needs you to help him find something to sober him up. He’ll mention “Windrest” if you talk to him again, providing a clue to where you can find such an ingredient. 

There are two ways to get the item required: 

![Wukong Fright 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Wukong_Fright_34.jpg)

  * If you complete the Man-in-Stone’s questline, you’ll find that the Man-in-Stone sells a **Sobering Stone** if you don’t want to explore.

![Wukong Yellow 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/13/Wukong_Yellow_10.jpg)

  * To locate the stone itself, you’ll need to head through the Yellow Wind Formation to the Windrest Hamlet, which is across the Windrest Bridge up the road past the Crouching Tiger Temple. Once you enter the hamlet, take a left to find a large building guarded by a Rat Soldier and Rat Imperial Guard. On the left side when looking at the large building, defeat a Blazebone monster, and then look to the right for a small alcove, where you can spot a glowing pot. Break the pot, and you’ll find the **Sobering Stone**.

When you return it to the Drunken Boar, he’ll thank you, and declare that he’s now off in search of a meaty meal. He doesn’t actually want you to get some for him, and will set off himself to the Crouching Tiger Temple. 

![Wukong Yellow 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4f/Wukong_Yellow_34.jpg)

At the temple entrance, start to head up the stairs, and then turn right before the top — opposite where the Meditation Spot is. You’ll find the Boar resting against a far wall under one of the giant tiger sculptures.He’ll complain of the poor meat quality, and instead ask that you bring him a **Jade Lotus**. If you don’t already have plenty gathered, you’ll find Jade Lotus to harvest in most ponds and bodies of water, like the one right at the start of the chapter. 

![Wukong Yellow 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Wukong_Yellow_35.jpg)

When you give the Boar the Jade Lotus, he’ll relay some interesting information about a “Realm of Gold” that he’s seeking, and will leave the temple. 

![Wukong Sandgate 71.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/94/Wukong_Sandgate_71.jpg)

This “senior brother” is the First Prince of Flowing Sand — aka the giant rat Yaoguai Chief that you can fight in the Valley of Despair on the road from Sandgate Village to the Crouching Tiger Temple. If you didn’t kill the rat king, he’ll summon the prince to fight you. Otherwise, you can use the Pungent Flesh Chunk to summon and defeat him yourself. He’ll drop the Arhat Gold Piece when defeated, which is the gold the Boar needs. 

![Wukong Sahali 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ae/Wukong_Sahali_1.jpg)

The Boar will actually return to near where you first met him at the Rockrest Flat area of the Fright Cliff. However, instead of sitting on a rock, he’ll now be standing over by the stairs leading to a large door you can’t access yet. 

Unfortunately, he’s not too pleased that you’re in possession of the gold, and will challenge you to a duel. Upon defeat, he’ll relent and offer to let you join him in exploring the Realm of Gold together, before vanishing off behind the giant gate up the stairs. 

![Wukong Sahali 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Wukong_Sahali_10.jpg)

Once you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into the Kingdom of Sahali 

## "Tiger Vanguard" Mini-Boss Fight and Guide

While this Tiger Vanguard is indeed related to the one you’ve faced at the Crouching Tiger Temple, he doesn’t fight in quite the exact same style, despite also having a sword. Understanding the differences and similarities in their style can help you succeed in this fight, but it will take a little practice. 

![Wukong Sahali 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/95/Wukong_Sahali_13.jpg)

This Tiger happens to be a big fan of lunging attacks, and will almost always start the fight by leaping at you low to the ground, clawing at you with his free hand as he comes to a stop. He’ll follow this with a slash from his sword rather quickly, and let the momentum carry him along the ground in a spin to perform a quick secondary overhead slash from his low position. 

It will take him a moment to get to his feet afterward, but you’ll want to react fast and retaliate, and possibly Immobilize him, or there’s a good chance he’ll leap away and retreat before his next attack. 

![Wukong Sahali 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f2/Wukong_Sahali_20.jpg)

Other times, his lunging attack will be just one big leaping sword slice while low to the ground, which is easier to dodge as it has no follow up most of the time, though he will turn to this move instead of finishing some of his combo attacks to throw you off your guard. 

Every so often, he’ll decline the lunge, and simply swing his sword up to send a projectile slash your way. The good news is it's rare and just a single slash, moving slow enough that it can be dodged reliably well. 

![Wukong Sahali 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f6/Wukong_Sahali_14.jpg)

Note that you can use the Rock Solid deflection spell to surprise him (since it's his own spell that he passed down to the son you gained it from) but he can also use the spell as well. It’s not as obvious as when the other boss used it, as his fur will darken but he won’t turn completely to stone. 

![Wukong Sahali 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/12/Wukong_Sahali_19.jpg)

If you ever see him freeze up (usually in a ready stance) hold off on attacking and instead charge up for a heavy attack when he starts to move again. If you attack too early, he’ll counter your deflected attack by whirling on you with a claw swipe, followed by a leaping downward slash with a huge arc and a delay before he lands. 

![Wukong Sahali 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/23/Wukong_Sahali_15.jpg)

He can also employ this huge sweeping arc attack by other means, most notably when he tries to plunge his sword in the ground near you, he’ll rip it out while performing a huge spin attack. 

![Wukong Sahali 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/41/Wukong_Sahali_16.jpg)

Another attack he employs frequently begins when he pivots his body by spinning into an over the shoulder claw swipe, which he’ll quickly follow through by swiping back upwards, and then kick outward after a short delay. You can parry the first below with Rock Solid when you see him spin to completely throw him off of the whole combo. 

![Wukong Sahali 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bf/Wukong_Sahali_18.jpg)

One powerful (yet deflectable) attack he can also employ has a long wind up as he’ll drag his sword slowly along the ground, building up friction and sparks as he drags it to you before ripping the blade up. Rock Solid can stop the attack but won’t always stagger him, but it’s easier to see coming than other moves. 

![Wukong Sahali 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Wukong_Sahali_17.jpg)

As for his more unique attacks, watch for the Tiger Vanguard to raise his hands up, as he’ll then let loose an incredibly powerful roar that will damage you, and cause rock explosions all around him. This one can be very tough to dodge considering the range and how quickly he goes into the roar, but you can stop him short by Immobilizing him and then dealing enough damage to stagger him and prevent the roar altogether. 

Since he’s not as powerful or varied as the Vanguard of the Crouching Tiger Temple, nor is he as unrelentingly powerful as the Mad Tiger below the well, he shouldn’t give you as much problems as his sons. Remember to try switching up your stances — especially to the Thrust Stance — if you want to  it safe with longer range heavy strikes out of his reach. 

![Wukong Sahali 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e6/Wukong_Sahali_21.jpg)

Upon defeat, you’ll gain the **Tiger Tally** curio, and he’ll realize your prowess and invite you to meet his king.
