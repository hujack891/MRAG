# Tiny Piece of Gold

The Tiny Piece of Gold is one of the basic Treasures in Black Myth: Wukong. Unlike other Crafting Materials, this can be sold as soon as you get it. 

The item has no practical use, besides giving you some extra Will once sold. This is the lowest rarity, only providing a small Will buff.

The Tiny Piece of Gold can be found throughout the game's six chapters in the following locations: 

  * In Chests
  * Dropped from enemies upon death

The Tiny Piece of Gold is only of an Uncommon rarity, meaning you will likely find a lot of them early on in your through. Be sure to sell them at a vendor or the Shrine store as soon as you can.
