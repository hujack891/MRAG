The Yaksha King will draw two blades from his elbows, which will be angled behind him for the fight. These will glow brightly, and he'll use them traditionally as blades, but also be able to throw our circular projectiles from them.

Zhu Bajie will be helping you out at the start of this fight, so you can use him as a distraction while you get some hits in. It's also wise to try and hold off on healing as much as you can and allow Zhu Bajie to do this for you instead. 

When the Yaksha King begins to throw out those circular projectiles, you'll find that these often are around 4-5 at a time. It's best to dodge them by rolling forward, toward the Yaksha King, so you can immediately attack as the last one is dashed.

The move that feels like his signature for the fight is one where small blades emerge from the floor (almost grass-like). They are incredibly visible, but they'll only stick out slightly from the ground when he starts to perform the attack. When you see them, you'll have a few seconds to get away from the ring of blades, because they'll shoot up as full-blown spikes in no time. 

While it's easy to avoid this move at first, he has another variation that will cover a larger amount of the arena. This will begin with one circle of blades appearing, and then a second one forming as an extension. In this case, you can jump or dodge to avoid the attacks, but the timing of this can be difficult, so running from the area is the most straightforward way to not get caught in this.

You'll also find that he performs acrobatics around the arena, and will run up the wall occasionally. When he does this, he'll flip off of the rocks and try to land on you. As he lands, he will also send the blades up from the ground, along with rocks.

After knocking down a chunk of his health, there will be times when he starts to switch to using just one blade. You'll know when this is about to happen, as only one blade will glow brightly, while the other will be dimmed. When he does this, this will mean that the blade will be able to reach much further, and he'll create huge extended arcs with it. He often does this in chains of three and will start to say a word like "Merciless" or "Sheathless" before each attack. You'll want to learn the timings of this attack, so you can dodge and roll right underneath it each time.

In the second part of the fight, he'll become much more aggressive. This will also be when Zhu Bajie leaves the fight. He won't only swing the blade around himself like he did in the first portion of the fight, but he'll also swing the sword overhead and land it down in front of him. When he does this, he'll send out a trail of the grass-like blades. You can dodge the long arcs in the same way you did for the first part of the fight, and dodge side to side to avoid the trail of blades.

There's one particular attack in this second half of the fight where he'll charge at you. You'll need to dodge this, otherwise, he'll grab you and a short cutscene will begin. The Yaksha King will pummel The Destined One, and when you restart the fight, you'll see a significant chunk of your health gone.

You can approach this fight in a similar way to the Red Boy, in that it's best to save your spells until the second portion. Immobilize works on him, so when he's darting around more in the second half, you can trap him and make it easier to attack. Ebon Flow is also a good spell to use in this fight, as you can block his attacks with the defense option and build up focus to unleash heavy attacks to stagger him.
