To unlock this secret boss fight, you'll first need to encounter a simple-looking Treasure Hunter Human in Chapter 3, at the North Shore of the Bitter Lake in The New West.

Once you reach the shore, take a left when facing the Shrine and head past the area where Chen Loong is and through a gate to find a human being harassed by small Apramana Bats. Defeat them and talk to him to learn of his quest to find a treasure.

Once you reach the Valley of Ecstasy region, head along the main path through the Forest of Felicity and take a left down a slope to enter the Towers of Karma area. Search along the back of this sub-region to find the same Treasure Hunter freezing from the cold sitting in a large gnarled tree, left of the main Shrine in this area.

Perform the Circle of Fire Spell to warm him up, and he'll thank you, while giving you more clues to the location of a secret Melon Field.

This secret spot can be found by going right down the hill from the Forest of Felicity and down to the end of the Brook of Bliss' stream.

When you reach a cliff with some braziers, look down to find a spot to drop into a large open cave with a large Buddha Statue.

As you approach, the Treasure Hunter will reveal his true form and attack! 

## Green-Capped Martialist Boss Fight and Guide

The strange Green-Capped Martialist is a strong fighter who wields a fiery chakram that he can use in a variety of ways to surprise you with. It's not a bad idea to make sure you have some medicine on hand to cure burns, as you may find yourself in danger of taking fire damage often against this foes. Due to his prowess, you should also take other medicine to boost your damage and defenses, as he can be a relentless foes. 

![Wukong Martial 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/09/Wukong_Martial_2.jpg)

To start, he can spin his flaming chakram in front of him, using it as portal to open a quick fiery beam in your direction, which will require a quick dodge to the side to avoid. 

![Wukong Martial 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/91/Wukong_Martial_3.jpg)

A second part of this attack will trigger a ring of projectiles around his chakram to zoom toward you, which you'll need to also dodge shortly after the first blast. 

![Wukong Martial 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/22/Wukong_Martial_4.jpg)

When this boss chooses to close the distance on you, he'll employ some deceitful moves, like tossing his chakram to the side of your position, making you think he's going to miss, or tossing it in an arc. In reality, he'll dash up to it and then grab it to swing in a large arc toward your position, creating a second chakram for a two-hit combo. 

![Wukong Martial 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c8/Wukong_Martial_6.jpg)

He can also send his chakram spinning along the ground to slice past you. Sometimes he'll just use it to "walk the dog" as it slides at you and then back to him, but that's not all. While you're distracted, he can also follow up with a spinning kick before getting his weapon back. 

![Wukong Martial 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a5/Wukong_Martial_5.jpg)

After closing the distance, he can employ a variety of slashing combos with his chakram, like performing a leaping two-hit spin, and then after a short delay following up with a third spinning slice. 

This boss is also fond of teleporting to distract you as well, rapidly appearing behind or to the side of you before throwing his chakram at you to keep you guessing. 

Certain times, he'll vanish before performing a spinning leap with twin chakrams you'll need to anticipate and evade. Other times, he'll simply toss his chakram at you from afar and let it ride toward you. 

![Wukong Martial 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/16/Wukong_Martial_7.jpg)

When this happens, you'll need to stop focusing on the boss and pay more attention to his weapon, which will keep spinning toward you like a crazed wheel with a fiery trail that can keep criss-crossing for several times before he grabs it again. 

Stay close to his weapon, and when he finally appears to grab it, you can launch into an offensive while he's vulnerable to deal some damage. 

![Wukong Martial 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/aa/Wukong_Martial_8.jpg)

If you see pretend to vanish but reappear in the same spot, be ready for two clones to appear on either side of him, and they'll all toss their chakram wheels at you all at once that can be difficult to evade quickly. 

![Wukong Martial 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4e/Wukong_Martial_9.jpg)

The Martialist can also deflect your blows if you attempt to hit him with an extended light attack combo, holding his weapon out in front of him, and will then vanish to appear to the side of you to counter (but you can also turn the tables on him by being ready with a Rock Solid of your own). 

![Wukong Martial 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/22/Wukong_Martial_10.jpg)

Once he's below half health, he may start to launch two flaming chakram wheels around the arena instead of one. It may seem impossible, but the key to surviving this phase is to always keep the two chakrams in view as much as possible. They will almost always alternate charging at you, so as long as you keep track of their positions, you can keep dodging them as they charge you. 

![Wukong Martial 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/23/Wukong_Martial_11.jpg)

The Martialist will often end this phase by trying to ambush you out of nowhere, slicing both weapons to create a half-ring of fire in front of him. Dodge around to the side of the fire he creates so you can flank him without getting burned. 

Since he's such a cagey foe, getting a lock on him will be the hardest part of the fight, so you'll want to rely on slowing him down by deflecting his ambushes, or Immobilizing him before he can flee and expend your focus points for big hits. Don't bet on slow attacks or Spirits that take too long, or he'll run away before the hits can land. 

Once you've finally caught onto his tricks and taken him down, he'll flee the scene, declaring that he's "done as our brother asked". 

Green-Capped Martialist

You'll then find the mischievous little monk, as the entire field becomes verdant and full of melons. In lieu of eating some melons yourself, the monk will offer to share a very important power with you: the Spell-Binder Spell. This will actually lock down all of your spells, transferring an enormous amount of physical power to you instead, which can be incredibly useful when going up against bosses you'll meet later that can counter your spells. 

The little monk will even give you a hint about its use, and allude to someone waiting for you in the Grand Pagoda of the Pagoda Realm (which you can't fully access until you complete the other chapters).
