# Plaguebane Gourd

The Plaguebane Gourd is a unique Gourd in Black Myth: Wukong in that it offers an effect focused entirely around not refilling your health. The Rare Gourd comes with the bonus of halving your health recovery when using it, but your attack is increased for a short duration. 

This makes it a great Gourd for those looking to  risky, when compared to the other Gourds in the game, as the attack boost is quite potent. The Gourd only has five uses and can't be upgraded.

## Black Myth: Wukong Plaguebane Gourd Location

The Plaguebane Gourd can be found in in the chest after defeating the Mad Tiger boss in Yellow Wind Ridge. It requires you to defeat the Tiger Acolyte") and obtain the Old Rattle-Drum Key Item. 

To get the Old Rattle Drum, you will have to enter the Windrest Hamlet in the Yellow Sand Formation area and the head to three specific locations around the area, following a boy's voice. Our Old Rattle-Drum questline guide has everything you need to know, and you can also find a brief breakdown of the quest below: 

From the Windrest Hamlet Shrine, turn around and go back towards the Windrest Bridge Shrine. As you head through the gate at the bottom of the hill, take a left to find a small square area within the walls where you can use the drum.

You will know if you are in the right place, as the screen will go black and white and a young boy will start talking to you. 

Head back to the Valley of Despair Shrine. Go through the large gate. You will need the Keeness of Tiger and Sterness of Stone Key Items, which are along the main story path of this chapter and are unmissable. 

On your right, you will see a small hut, which you can go under to enter a yard. In the yard, the boy will talk again, and you can use the drum.

Finally, the last location is in Sandgate Village. From the Village Entrance Shrine, head through the gate you opened when you fought Earth Wolf in the large courtyard. You will have also seen the horseman here tied to a post. To the left of that post, where he was tied, is a small path leading to a well. 

Here you can use the drum and summon the boy who will lead you down into the well.

If you defeat the Mad Tiger down here, you will be able to open the chest and get yourself the Gourd.
