## How to Get the Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang Spirit

Instead of finding Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang lurking somewhere waiting for a fight, you have to evolve this one from an existing Spirit you will have picked up in Chapter 1, Baw-Li-Guh-Lang. Baw-Li-Guh-Lang can be found after reaching the Snake Trail Keeper's Shrine on Black Wind Mountain. Once you're there, run up the stairs on the right and take a left. You will come across a flimsy fence on the edge of a cliff on the left. Smash the fence and drop into the river below. Run to the right to find Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang.

Defeating Baw-Li-Guh-Yang will provide you with his Spirit and an item called a **Tadpole**. Unlike the other Spirits that cost Will and eventually a Knot of Voidness to upgrade, Baw-Li-Guhh-Yang requires Tadpoles. There are six frog bosses in Black Myth: Wukong, and each one yields a Tadpole when defeated. 

**There is one frog boss in each chapter. You must defeat all of them to collect enough Tadpoles to fully upgrade Baw-Li-Guh-Yang and unlock Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang.**

Spirits can be upgraded at any Keeper's Shrine by selecting _Cultivate Spirits_!

  * **Tongue Whip**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately reduces the Stamina cost for Jumps and Jump Attacks. 

Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang's Spirit allows you to embody one of five frogs, each with their own elemental attack. There is a poison frog, a thunder frog, a fire frog, an ice frog, and a stone frog. You won't know what frog you are going to get each time you use the move, but each frog has an excellent attack that deals a fair amount of damage. Channeling Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang also reduces the Stamina cost for Jumping, including Jump Attacks. The Jump Heavy Attack is a quick and effective way to land a strong hit, and this Spirit makes that move even less demanding.
