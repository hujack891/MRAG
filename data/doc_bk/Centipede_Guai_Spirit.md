## Centipede Guai Location

The Centipede Guai can be found in a massive pit full of skulls called the Bonevault. To reach the Bonevault, head to the Middle Hollow Keeper's Shrine in the Webbed Hollow. Drop down the wooden platform beside the Shrine and head straight forward to drop into the pit of bones.

## Centipede Guai Fight

The Centipede Guai is a huge armored centipede that has its own boss arena in the Webbed Hollow. It can be tricky to defeat as it's very fast, very strong, has some very hard-hitting attacks, and even has an army of minions on call. You can expect to see lots of belly-flop moves where the beast smashes its huge body into the ground multiple times, a roll-attack where it curls up into a ball and crashes around the arena, and a poison spray move where it spews pools of poison onto the ground.

The worst attack of all, however, occurs when the creature lets out a massive scream that summons a horde of small centipedes that explode on impact. Sprint and dodge out of the way to avoid the onslaught of poison. Bring some Antimiasma Powder just in case you need it.

  * **Rolling Ball**
  * Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Movement Speed. 

The Centipede Guai's Spirit allows you to take the form of the Centipede and perform the rolling ball move that you will have experienced during your fight. This move hits hard and can easily stagger foes, giving you a chance to land your own combo before they recover. Its equipped effect increases your Movement Speed as well, making it a great Spirit to equip when taking on challenges like the Iron Ball in the Flaming Mountains.
