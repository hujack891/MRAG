# Gold Button

The Gold Button is one of the many Curios items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. 

With the Gold Button equipped your attack power while at full health is significantly increased. 

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Gold Button Location

The Gold Button is dropped by one of the Fire Giants in the Emerald Hall in Furnace Valley within the Flaming Mountains.
