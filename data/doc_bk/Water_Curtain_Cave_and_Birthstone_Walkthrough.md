## Water Curtain Cave

At the start of Water Curtain Cave, go up the slope and to the cliff's edge. Run and jump across the gap to reach the path slightly below and be able to get behind the waterfall. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(3\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fe/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%283%29.png)

Head toward the path on the other side of the cave, where the lamp is glowing. Follow this until you reach the next section with a taller waterfall, then turn left. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(1\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/56/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%281%29.png)

Immediately, you'll see a giant staff in the center of the room. Make your way over to it and let the cutscene  out. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough .png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/df/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_.png)

After another story from Zhu Bajie, the giant staff will shrink and you'll be able to get it from the body of water in front of you. Now that you've acquired the Jingubang and look exactly like Wukong, head to the back of the cave directly ahead. 

Follow the path to the peak, where you'll come to the Return Path Keeper's Shrine. 

## Return Path

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(13\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e6/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2813%29.png)

Continue up the path, where you'll have to face off against numerous soldiers along the way. This is really just a chance for you to test the power of Jingubang, and pick up some extra Will and Sparks. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(12\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/12/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2812%29.png)

About halfway up, Zhu Bajie loses his patience and transforms into a boar, knocking down a number of soldiers as he dashes off. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(11\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2811%29.png)

Just keep working your way up to the top of the path, taking out as many soldiers as you want along the way. You'll pass by a portion of the path covered in fire, and then enter into a cave. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(8\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0e/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%288%29.png)

Go to the top of the cave, then turn left, and follow the path until you need to squeeze through a gap in the wall. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(9\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1a/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%289%29.png)

When you emerge on the other side, you'll see the final stretch of the path that dips down and then slopes upward. Head for the top and activate the Peak of Innocence Keeper's Shrine, just before the end of the path. 

## Peak of Innocence

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(4\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/ca/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%284%29.png)

Make your way to the top of the peak and you'll find Zhu Bajie near a mysterious stone. Go over to the stone and interact with it to be transported to another realm. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(5\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4d/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%285%29.png)

On the other side, you'll find the Old Monkey. He'll tell you to step onto a boat, and then transport you across the water, while he recites the memories of Wukong. 

## Birthstone - Heart of Birthstone

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(14\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9b/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2814%29.png)

When the boat ride is over, you'll be at the Birthstone portion of the Water Curtain Cave. In the distance, you'll see a monkey sitting cross-legged in the water. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(17\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ac/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2817%29.png)

As the cutscene sees you move toward the Stone Monkey, you'll be automatically thrown into a fight against it. 

Note! You won't be able to activate the Heart of Birthstone Keeper's Shrine here unless you die, but if you do, you won't need to go back to a previous shrine – you'll automatically be transported back here. 

### Stone Monkey

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(15\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b9/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2815%29.png)

This fight has two phases, so be prepared for a tough battle and think about how you manage your Gourd and Spell usage throughout. You'll want to take in medicines that include Body-Warming and Body-Cooling Powder, as well as those that strengthen your attacks such as Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets and Loong Aura Amplification Pellets. You might prefer other medicines depending on the build you're ing with, such as the Mirage or Life-Saving Pill. 

The first thing to note is that the Stone Monkey, like other Stone enemies, is resistant to elemental attacks, so the best thing you can do here is have a build that focuses on high attack strength and increasing the chances of critical attacks. His resistance to these attacks should also influence the Transformation you take into the fight with you – we'd recommend Ebon Flow or Azure Dust, which can both deliver heavy blows. 

### The Stone Monkey Phase One

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(18\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/01/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2818%29.png)

During the first phase of the fight, the Stone Monkey will generally try to attack with a combo of punches. These can be avoided but it's best to use dodges to build up your focus quickly. Speed is key for this first phase, to keep as many of your medicines and Gourd uses available for the second phase. 

He will also leap up and pound his fists down onto the ground, causing a shockwave of rocks immediately around him. As long as you dive out of the way when he goes to land or step back from him slightly, you can avoid this attack. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(26\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a6/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2826%29.png)

When his health is down to around 70%, he will start to disappear occasionally and quickly reappear to catch you off guard. You can watch the ripples in the water to see where he'll approach from and quickly evade. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(25\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/92/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2825%29.png)

This will also be the time when he starts to glow slightly, indicating that his attacks will begin to differ. You'll now see that when he punches down on the ground, shockwaves will be sent out. You can jump or roll over these to dodge them. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(24\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d4/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2824%29.png)

Along with this move, you'll see that he will sometimes end the combo by keeping his hand in the water after punching down. The ground will start to pulse and he'll pull his first up, causing a shockwave of rocks to go upward. 

Two other attacks happen less frequently, but go on for longer and can be more dangerous. The first one is that now and then, he'll flash gold and your attacks will repel. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(29\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d7/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2829%29.png)

He'll freeze at this moment, and it can seem like a time to strike, but he's actually preparing to grab you. If he's able to, a small cutscene s where you're thrown and slammed on the ground either side of him. The second attack is when he goes berserk and starts slamming his fists down on the ground around him more violently and quicker than his usual attack. 

Your aim during this portion of the fight should be to dodge attacks while building focus, and max out the four Focus Points as soon as possible. With Wukong's armor and staff, these won't deplete, so you can land impressive heavy attacks with the staff. 

### Stone Monkey Phase Two

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(22\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/42/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2822%29.png)

When you've depleted his health bar, a cutscene will . The Stone Monkey's arms will start to glow, and suddenly, they'll be ablaze. This is when the second phase of the fight starts, which is far more difficult, and his health bar will be fully replenished. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(19\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9a/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2819%29.png)

The important thing to remember for this second phase is that the attacks he performs don't really change from the first phase. He just replaces the rocks with fire and ice. But the trickiest part of the fight is how quickly and often he switches between the use of frost of fire. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(20\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a7/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2820%29.png)

There are multiple things to consider if you're struggling with this portion of the fight, such as taking in the Fire Vessel to help protect against burn damage, and the Body-Cooling and Body-Warming Powders we mentioned earlier. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(27\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2827%29.png)

The Plantain Fan is also a good option, to remove the elements from him and knock him back while you follow up with your own attacks. It at least buys you some time to take down a chunk of his health without retaliation. 

It's still worth focusing on heavy attacks and increasing your Critical Hit chances to finish the fight quickly in this second phase. If you stick with using Wukong's armor and staff, your Critical Hit chance will increase with Spells, so it's worth unleashing them in this second phase – particularly as they'll also receive a reduced cooldown buff. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(28\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/21/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2828%29.png)

Around the halfway mark of this second phase, things get even more complicated. The Stone Monkey will reach for a hair and perform his own version of the Pluck of Many spell. He'll split in two, with two health bars appearing on screen. When this happens, you'll now experience both fire and ice at the same time, with each monkey alternating between the two elements. 

Thankfully, the attacks won't vary hugely here so you should be familiar with them at this stage. But you will need to keep shifting your attention between the two enemies as each one takes the lead. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(31\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2831%29.png)

Some more projectiles are brought into  here, however. Occasionally, one of the monkeys will pull up a large rock from the ground and throw it at you, or you'll see one prepare to throw an orb of ice followed by an orb of fire at you. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(30\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2830%29.png)

The final part of this move is typically an even larger orb of fire will be thrown your way. This will mean that you can't spend all your time as close to them as possible, and will need to dip back at times to easily avoid these attacks. 

At this stage, it's worth throwing out your spells like Pluck of Many to overwhelm the two enemies and using Immobilize to keep one in place, while you target the other. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(32\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/dd/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2832%29.png)

When the Stone Monkey's health bar has been depleted, he'll face off still against The Destined One. A cutscene will see the Destined One hold his own against the giant monkey, sending our duplicates to put an end to the creature. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(35\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cb/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2835%29.png)

As it staggers back and breaks down into stone, electricity will form around it and the Great Sage's Broken Shell will appear. Despite going straight into this fight from the Stone Monkey, all your Spells, Gourd uses, and health will be replenished. 

The Stone Monkey

### The Great Sage's Broken Shell

Now comes your final challenge, and just like before, if you die, you'll be sent back to the Heart of Birthstone Keeper's Shrine. You won't need to fight the Stone Monkey again, however. 

For this fight, you can expect two phases as well. You'll essentially be going up against a better version of yourself, with access to fully unlocked skills and stances that are also available to you. 

He'll use variations of **Vengeful Mirage, which leaves an exploding illusion behind, Rock Solid, Ring of Fire, and Pluck of Many**. On top of this, he'll use Smash, Pillar, and Thrust Stance attacks. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(60\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/08/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2860%29.png)

We'd recommend having Ring of Fire equipped, so you can match him, and upgrade it as much as possible. Strangely enough, if you step into his Ring of Fire, you can also use it to build your Focus. 

However, you may prefer to use Spell Binder (if you've unlocked it) and increase your Attack and Critical Hit Chance. We'd also suggest using Plantain Fan again in this phase. You should also use Medicines like the Loong Aura Amplification Pellets, Ginseng Pellets, and Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets to buff your Focus gain and attack. 

### The Great Sage's Broken Shell Phase One

The Great Sage's Broken Shell will start this phase by dodging your attacks each time you try to complete combos. As these are perfect dodges, you'll see multiple illusions left behind in its wake, which will explode after a few seconds. To counter this, you'll want to land a few hits, and then jump back to avoid the explosions, but continue to follow up and complete the combos for a heavy attack. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(59\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a6/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2859%29.png)

We'd suggest throwing out the Plantain Fan as soon as the fight starts, to knock him back, and allow you to whittle his health down quickly before he even gets a chance to start. In terms of Transformations and Spirits, we found that Ebon Flow was useful for deflecting his attacks and quickly building might to perform a powerful finisher, and the Wandering Wight Spirit was able to take down a chunk of his health in one go. 

You'll see the Great Sage's Broken Shell's version of a heavy attack, as the staff glows gold and he jumps up with his staff to smash it down on you. These moves can also be evaded, to help build up your own focus for a counterattack. Again, you'll want to take advantage of Wukong's arm and staff in this fight, by using the fourth focus point for heavy attacks, and making use of the increased Critical Hit Chance. 

When the Great Sage uses his variation of Pluck of Many, you'll see a duplicate appear as close as possible to you and will swing its staff. This will disappear after attacking, so you won't have to face multiple duplicates all at once. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(53\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bf/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2853%29.png)

As mentioned, the Great Sage will use multiple stances, and you'll occasionally see him climb his staff to perform Pillar Stance. This is not to evade your attacks but is just a way to slam down on you from above. As you see the staff start to bend toward you, get ready to dash away. 

Finally, be mindful of where you stand in this fight. If you're too far from him, he'll throw out his staff as a spinning projectile, or swap to Thrust Stance to attack you. It's best to stick close to him but jump back when he performs perfect dodges or throws out Pluck of Many. 

Just like the Stone Monkey, once you've got his health bar down all the way, phase two will begin. 

### The Great Sage's Broken Shell Phase Two

At the start of this phase, the Great Sage will remove your relics from you, so you'll lose the buffs you selected when unlocking them. This is when you'll want to rely more on your Medicines, Curios, and Spells, especially Ring of Fire to build up your focus quickly. It can be much harder to hit him during this phase, so you'll need to  it somewhat safe to build up your focus. 

You also need to be careful when using your Gourd at this stage. When you do, it's best to dodge to be safe but try to limit your use of it. This is because the Great Sage can Immobilize you and steal your Gourd for himself. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(58\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0a/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2858%29.png)

In this phase, you'll generally see the same attacks as the first phase, but there will of course be additional variations or they will be heightened. One of these changes includes the Great Sage's Broken Shell climbing to the top of his staff just like before, but this time, unleashing a flurry of projectiles. Tap dodge and roll to the side quickly to avoid this and build up focus while doing so. Then be prepared for him to slide down toward you, skim the water, and quickly dash back at you to try for another hit. 

His combos will also become more aggressive and dangerous, and you'll see him jump up in the air and spin his staff multiple times. It will glow red as he smashes it down, and you'll need to dash out of the way to avoid it doing huge amounts of damage. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(40\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b7/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2840%29.png)

Lastly, you'll see him use the Somersault Cloud spell to zoom around the area, hit you, and dash off. He will try to grab you when using this, so it's important to learn the timings and roll away as often as possible. 

Just like the first phase, the key to this fight is attacking when you have your Focus Points built up and not trying to finish light combos. He'll typically interrupt them or use his perfect dodge to hurt you in the process, so it's best to wait until you can land those heavy attacks. It's also important to note him during his Rock Solid phase! Otherwise, you'll see the Destined One kicked around by the Great Sage's duplicates. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(37\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/37/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2837%29.png)

Using Gingseng Pellets and Ring of Fire will get your Focus up in no time, and Smash Stance is generally favorable here, to land those heavy slamming attacks. Don't forget to throw out the Plantain Fan as soon as it's ready each time, as well, as this is one of the best ways to attack him undisturbed. 

Once the fight is over, The Great Sage's Broken Shell will be vanquished, and a cutscene will begin. The Great Sage will stumble in the water and the relics will leave his body as golden orbs. 

Each one will land inside the Destined One as the Great Sage crumbles, and his crown lands in the water. As the Old Monkey appears again, he'll place the crown upon the Destined One's head and finish the tale of Sun Wukong.
