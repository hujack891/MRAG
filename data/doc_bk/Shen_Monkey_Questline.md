# Shen Monkey Questline

The Shen Monkey is a friendly character and merchant you can meet in Chapter 1 of Black Myth Wukong. After being rescued, he will offer a variety of services to improve your healing Gourd, as well as selling new items as you progress through the game. 

## How to Save the Shen Monkey

You’ll first meet the Shen Monkey halfway into Chapter 1 in the Bamboo Grove of the Black Wind Mountain. After defeating the Yaoguai Chief, Guangmou, you’ll reach the **Marsh of the White Mist** Shrine.

Heading down the path from the shrine, you’ll encounter a Snake Patroller harassing a monkey hanging from a ceiling, and requesting your aid. Defeat the snake, and the **Shen Monkey** will offer his thanks, and usher you into a nearby cave where he resides.

Talking to the Shen Monkey in his cave, you’ll find that he’s a merchant of gourds, drinks, and brews! Be sure to check all of his options out: 

  * **Upgrade Gourds** \- By using the  Luojia Fragrant Vine you just found by the nearby Shrine, you upgrade the charges in your **Old Gourd** from 4 swigs to 5, turning into a Medicine Gourd, and giving you more uses of its healing properties.
  * **Upgrade Drinks** \- The default drink stored in your healing Gourd is **Coconut Wine** , which restores a third of your health for each swig. Once you find Awaken Wine Worms, return to him and you’ll be able to upgrade the amount healed with each use!
  * **Brew** \- With your equipped Drink, you can enhance it by adding a Soak to increase additional effects beyond the heal. You can try it out now by adding the **Gall Gem** , which will increase your poison resistance in addition to the heal from your Gourd.
  * Store - If the Gall Gem isn’t all that enticing, be sure to check his shop, as the Shen Monkey also sells items. He’ll only sell an **alternate Soak** to start with, but will upgrade his stock as your advance through new chapters. 

## In the the Zodiac Village

During Chapter 3, once you arrive at the North Shore of the Bitter Lake, you can fight an old dragon along the shore known as Chen Loong, who will then complain that his old bones are in need of medicine. 

Travel back to the Xu Dog in the Cellar below the Crouching Tiger Temple, and talk to him to receive the medicine that Chen Loong needs. 

As a reward, Chen Loong will give you a special scroll to visit the Zodiac Village, where several merchants will now permanently reside, including the Shen Monkey. Since he stays at this location, be sure to visit him often to keep on top of upgrades and new purchases:
