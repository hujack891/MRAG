# Spirit Locations

Black Myth: Wukong allows you to absorb the **Spirits** of some enemies. This power can then be channeled for a small amount of time to perform a move to assist in battle. Each chapter is filled with Spirits to collect, and many of them can be tricky to find. Here, you will find the locations of each and every spirit in the game, including notes on how to defeat them and what powers they share with you.
