# Cyan Loong

Cyan Loong is an optional secret Yaoguai King boss fight that you can encounter in Chapter 3 of Black Myth Wukong. Hiding on the far side of Turtle Island this frozen boss can't be activated until you obtain a Key Item in the previous chapter. Cyan Loong is one of four Loong Dragons that can be defeated to earn powerful weapon crafting materials. 

  * Rewards: Tridacna Pendant, Thunderbone, Loong Pearl x1, Refined Iron Sand x2, Mind Core x1

## Where to Find Cyan Loong

As an optional secret boss, Cyan Loong can be found once you reach Turtle Island on the Bitter Lake. You can find his frozen body apparently fishing off the side of the "island" by heading right from the Turtle Island Shrine. 

However, in order to activate this secret boss, you'll need to obtain the Loong Scales from the Yellow Wind Ridge in Chapter 2.

Head through the Sandgate Village and defeat the King of Flowing Sand and his Second Rat Prince son. After defeating the pair (or only the son), head left from the boss arena and into the Valley of Despair.

Once you arrive in the large covered valley area, keep to the left to find a large lower platform by a slightly rounded red wall lined with small statues. At this point, if you did not kill the King of Flowing Sand, he’ll summon his other son, the First Rat Prince — otherwise you can use the Pungent Flesh Chunk to summon him yourself.

While fighting the First Rat Prince, you can lure him into performing one of his large slam attacks when facing the rounded wall, and it will cause a crack to appear in the wall. If you are unable to lure the boss into forming a crack in the wall, you can even do so yourself by hitting it with a very strong attack - we recommend the Wandering Wight’s Spirit Attack, or the Azure Dust Transformation Spell’s final attack.

You can enter the crack in the wall, and on the other side you’ll find a chest containing the Loong Scales. With this item, you’ll be able to unlock the boss. 

## Cyan Loong Boss Fight and Guide

While the Cyan Loong is a bit smaller than Black Loong, he is much more ferocious, and can use his lightning powers to quickly deal double damage and tear you to pieces -- especially if you choose to face him after arriving on Turtle Island. You'll likely want to at least craft all three pieces of the Loongscale Armor unlocked by defeating Kang-Jin Star, as it boasts a reduction from being shocked which can help you survive. You should also have the Loongwreathe or Kang-Jin Staff, and have a good set of spells equipped that compliment your attacks -- we reccomend Immobilize and Rock Solid, but you can also try using the Ring of Fire to buff yourself up in since the arena is small. 

The Cyan Loong doesn't have a huge amount of attacks, but when they hit, they hit hard! 

![Wukong Turtle 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0d/Wukong_Turtle_25.jpg)

One of his most common attacks will have him briefly swim toward you before diving in to perform two standing sword slashes in quick succession. He'll follow up by floating high and charging up lightning in his hand to strike the ground in front of him, requiring you to dodge both the attack and the resulting strike that appears at the point he touches. 

![Wukong Turtle 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ef/Wukong_Turtle_26.jpg)

Expect him to also utilize his sword slashes in simple 1 or 2 hit attacks, or use his lightning palm attack on its own. His sword swings aren't too fast, but they can blindside you if you aren't ready to break off your attacks or use up all your stamina. 

![Wukong Turtle 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7f/Wukong_Turtle_29.jpg)

Another dangerous attack he can launch with little warning only comes with a small tell -- when he quickly swaps his sword to hold in a reverse grip behind his back. He'll then quickly launch himself through the air at you with a spinning slash that can take a chunk off your health, and then dive back to your position after a moment for sword slice when he reaches the ground. 

![Wukong Turtle 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ad/Wukong_Turtle_30.jpg)

The good news is his final sword slice allows for an extended moment to dodge around and attack him from behind. However, you'll need to keep your eyes open when trying to attack from behind, as he can easily whip his mace-like tail around to hit you. Watch for it to rise up to the top left before slashing down to the bottom right to know when to deflect or evade. 

![Wukong Turtle 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b5/Wukong_Turtle_27.jpg)

In addition to his standard sword swings and combos, the Cyan Loong can change things up by charging up and holding his sword back pointed straight at you before launching into a slow two-handed swing, or pausing to spin for a backhand slash as he whirls around. 

![Wukong Turtle 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f3/Wukong_Turtle_31.jpg)

The good news is with his form only slightly bigger than yours, the Cyan Loong is fairly susceptible to being staggered. Even a full Light Combo can send him stumbling backward, which you can mix in with a varied combo and follow up from the Smash Stance, stagger his sword swings with Rock Solid, and use a bulky Spirit attack like the Second Rat Prince to send him sprawling again and again and limit his ability to attack back. 

![Wukong Turtle 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bf/Wukong_Turtle_32.jpg)

However, once you manage to get his health down to around half, he'll imbue his sword with electricity in drawn out flourish, ending with him stabbing the sword into the ground to send up electric blasts all around him. You can try poking him from a distance with the Thrust Stance but be wary not to get too close. 

![Wukong Turtle 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5d/Wukong_Turtle_33.jpg)

With his freshly empowered sword, Cyan Loong will deal more damage than ever before. A single sword swing can cleave your health apart, and if you already have the shock status effect, you can easily die in a single hit if you aren't careful. Be sure to counter this new phase with Evil Repelling Medicament to increase your defense, and have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand for any moment you do get the status effect. 

![Wukong Turtle 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9d/Wukong_Turtle_35.jpg)

Several of his moves have also been improved. His electric palm strike for instance now causes several lightning strikes in front of him, up from just a single blast, requiring you to dodge around to his sides instead of backward. 

If he begins to hold his sword back while pointing at you, the air will crackle around him preventing you from getting close, and his two-handed sword swing will also unleash an electric projectile slash you'll need to evade. 

![Wukong Turtle 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/31/Wukong_Turtle_36.jpg)

The good news is that his blade won't stay enchanted forever, often ending with the previously mentioned attack. Once you no longer see electricity crackling along his blade, that's your cue to go back to pressing the attack by getting in staggering blows. 

![Wukong Turtle 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/75/Wukong_Turtle_34.jpg)

In particular, we recommend the Red Tides transformation spell to evade around his attacks while burning him, as he swings are slow enough that you can have an easier time performing the wolf guai's ultimate spell attack for big damage. 

This fight will largely come down to learning his moves enough that you can anticipate and avoid his powerful attacks, and find your opening to keep him staggered and on the defensive. Once you learn how to keep away from his sword swings, you'll be able to take him down for good. 

![Wukong Turtle 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/94/Wukong_Turtle_37.jpg)

When he falls, you'll earn some Fine Gold Thread and another Loong Pearl, and can loot a nearby chest that appears for the Mountain-Shaking Claw material and Breath of Fire Soak for your Gourd. This new material will unlock the upgrade path for your Loongwreathe Staff into the Golden Loong Staff, but you'll need to find and defeat the last of the four Loongs to craft it.
