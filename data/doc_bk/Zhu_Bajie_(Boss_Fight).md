## Where to Find Zhu Bajie

Zhu Bajie's boss fight is a two-part main boss and non-missable encounter that you'll find exploring the massive Webbed Hollow Portion of Chapter 4. After descending down to the Lower Hollow, follow the linear path to reach the Hut of Immortality, where you'll have your first fight against him. 

After his first defeat, Zhu Bajie will retreat from the hut, and create a new pathway outside from the shrine to a large muddy area where the second fight will begin. 

## Zhu Bajie Boss Fight and Guide - First Encounter

Your old friend Zhu Bajie is not exactly himself, and now that he's been bewitched, you'll have to beat some sense into him. This is no easy task, as the scrappy little pig once journeyed with Wukong himself. This makes him a wily fighter, if a bit unorthodox. 

Zhu Bajie prefers to attack with his special 9-pointed rake, and while it may look silly, it's absolutely dangerous. He can swing it in wide arcs in a few different ways, but he usually has a slow wind-up at first that you can dodge away from.

When his rake glows red, he'll charge up his rake attacks with explosive force. These will usually send you reeling back if you try to deflect them (or at the very least not stagger the boss), and if they hit the swings cleave into the ground, they'll cause waves of force to explode outward from his swings.

He can also perform a tricky move to counter where he jumps into the air, and pauses for a moment before slamming down with his rake. He'll immediately slide past you, pivoting to slam down again when you think you've evaded the attack.

He can also steal a trick from Guangzhi and use his rake like a pogo stick, slamming down with it before hopping up and spin into another downward slash attack. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8a/Wukong_LowerHollow_42.jpg)

When he starts spinning his rake in a low, wide arc, he can continue to spin until turning into a literal tornado. It can be hard to dodge at first, but once you do he'll have a hard time course-correcting, and you can follow his path until he spins himself dizzy. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c2/Wukong_LowerHollow_43.jpg)

Quickly move in to make use of his stunned state, but you should probably try and attack from the sides, as he can sometimes react to the spinning by throwing up all over you... which isn't great. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 46.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/82/Wukong_LowerHollow_46.jpg)

Thanks to his clumsiness, and that he's prone to stumbling back and falling when staggered by big hits, you'll have a lot of opportunities to unleash your charged up hits and Spirit Attacks on him, but you'll still want to be ready to go on the defensive any time you see him flare up with energy. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 47.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/04/Wukong_LowerHollow_47.jpg)

Once you've dealt enough damage to clear his health bar, Zhu Bajie will flee the Hut of Immortality. The battle isn't exactly over, but you will get some experience and will for surviving the encounter. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 48.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f5/Wukong_LowerHollow_48.jpg)

There actually isn't anything more you can do in the Hut of Immortality, as all the doors are sealed. However, when you return to the Shrine outside, you'll find a new cave path has been carved out that leads outside to a large muddy hole. 

Your battle with Zhu Bajie isn't over. In fact -- it's about to get a whole lot harder. 

## Zhu Bajie Boss Fight and Guide - Second Encounter

For this encounter, the pig clearly has the home field advantage, and he'll remind you every step of the way with a wide variety of painful moves that are extremely hard to dodge. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 51.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/47/Wukong_LowerHollow_51.jpg)

This is because fighting in the mud will drastically slow any dodge roll you try to make to get out of the way of his attacks. You can alleviate this somewhat with the help of one of the Sages Relic's passive buffs, or a particular gourd soak, but they won't put you back on even footing. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 50.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f1/Wukong_LowerHollow_50.jpg)

This means you'll have to be even more precise in your dodging, and using spells like Immobilize, Rock Solid, or Cloud Step to avoid attacks you can't roll away from in time. 

The most important thing to note is that the mud hinders your ability to dodge, but it does **not** slow your ability to sprint. This means there are several situations and attacks where it can be preferable to run instead of waiting for a last second evade, so try to remember that option during this fight. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 52.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/02/Wukong_LowerHollow_52.jpg)

If there's any good news, its that for the first half of the fight, he'll continue to use most of the same moves as he did in the Hut of Immortality. Though you will have to be more precise in your dodging, you'll at least have an idea of what to expect. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 53.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8a/Wukong_LowerHollow_53.jpg)

A few moves will be altered slightly, as instead of tearing up the ground with his rake, he can send muddy projectiles your way instead, which seem to have a more more narrow arc to compensate for your diminished evasion. 

He can also still spin into a tornado (which you should try to sprint away from rather than dodge), and getting hit by it can send you flying. However, he won't get dizzy this time around, so prepare for him to quickly move into his next move rather than standing around for awhile. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 54.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9e/Wukong_LowerHollow_54.jpg)

One new move (and herald of things to come) will often appear after one of his jumping slash attacks. Once he hits the ground, he'll use his own transformation attack to turn into a giant muddy carp, which will quickly roll forward to try and flatten you, but you can dodge under it with some timing. 

Fight carefully, and take note of which of his rake attacks swing fast, vs the ones that take time to swing around to dodge at the right times, or have a focus point in reserve to use a Thrust Stance varied combo and get out of his attack range. 

Once you take off half his health bar, things will get real messy fast. Zhu Bajie will go back to his roots, in a sense, and transform into a giant boar that just can't wait to roll around in the mud with you. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 55.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ef/Wukong_LowerHollow_55.jpg)

In this form, he'll start by performing a series of charge attacks after stamping the ground to cause muddy geysers to erupt all around. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 56.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/85/Wukong_LowerHollow_56.jpg)

When he begins to charge, you can still sprint out of the way, but you'll need to act fast. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 57.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9b/Wukong_LowerHollow_57.jpg)

Spot dodging can also work here, and if you try to perform a Rock Solid Deflect, you'll be knocked backward, but he'll often stumble to the ground as well, letting you get up and get some hits in before he regains his footing. 

Boar Bajie has a lot of wide swinging attacks to be wary of, often shifting his body weight to slam his head to the side or swing it upwards. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 62.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/86/Wukong_LowerHollow_62.jpg)

He can also dive at you in a diving tackle that can be very damaging if it lands, and you'll need to dodge as he lands, but be ready for him to rise up and turn to hit you with his hind legs in a mule kick attack. 

After taking a bit of damage, Boar Bajie will eventually let out a huge roar, starting a very long and terrifying phase. He'll begin to transform into different beasts, which have their own attacks you'll need to adapt to. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 58.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/85/Wukong_LowerHollow_58.jpg)

He'll start by transforming into a giant carp fish, which will wiggle a bit before leaping high into the air. Immediately get onto your Pillar Stance before he slams down on the ground, as it will release a shockwave across the mud that's hard to dodge given the conditions of the arena. You'll only have a moment to land your Pillar Stance smash, but after that you should only be focused on evasion (you won't be able to Immobilize his transformations). 

![Wukong LowerHollow 59.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/76/Wukong_LowerHollow_59.jpg)

In his carp form, he'll swim about for a moment to try ramming you, and will then back off before swimming forward to dive at you, going under the mud as he does. It'll be hard to anticipate when he surfaces, so be ready to evade at a moment's notice. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 60.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/01/Wukong_LowerHollow_60.jpg)

Once he's out of the mud and on the surface, he'll transform again, this time into a large rhino, and begin to charge at you. If this wasn't bad enough, he'll summon two copies to charge just behind him on either side, making dodging extremely risky. 

The only good news is that the copies don't seem to alter their path once they start the charge, but Zhu Bajie will, so you'll need to be careful about timing your dodges and not rolling into a path of a copy. Rock Solid will only move you backward, and won't be too much help if it traps you in front of him. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 61.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/33/Wukong_LowerHollow_61.jpg)

Once he charges for a third time, he'll lose the clones, and then transform back into a fish for a moment. Wait for him to dive through the air past you, and he'll then rocket toward you as a giant glob of mud. 

Dodge or deflect if you can't move fast enough, and be ready for his boar form to reappear dazed and winded from the phase. This is your big opportunity to hit him with all the focus points you've stored up, as well as any powerful Spirit Attacks you can unleash. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 63.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/73/Wukong_LowerHollow_63.jpg)

One last thing to remember is that while you may have problems dodging, the same isn't always true for your Transformation Spells. In a pinch, they can be used to give you a level of evasion your can't achieve on your own, so long as you don't act too reckless and waste your might. 

This will be a tough fight to survive, and may take more than a few tries to understand how to survive his biggest attacks. At the very least, this phase only lasts for one half of his health bar. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 64.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/13/Wukong_LowerHollow_64.jpg)

Once you manage to burn down the rest of his health, you'll finally be able to free Zhu Bajie from the bewitching effect of the needle that was stabbed into his head, thanks to the mirror you found on the Right Hand of Buddha. 

Zhu Bajie

Unfortunately, the spiders aren't done with him, and he'll be whisked away, leaving you with his **Blood-Stained Needle** and the **Jade Moon Rabbit Curio**.
