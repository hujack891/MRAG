# Iron Pellet

The Iron Pellet is one of the Rare Soaks for your Gourds in Black Myth: Wukong. The Soak's ability is rather specialised, useful for specific spell builds or when adopting a particular style, over some of the other Soaks, which are better for general use. 

With the Iron Pellet Soak equipped, using the gourd can no longer be interrupted by incoming attacks. Additionally, using the Gourd with the Soak provides considerable damage reduction. 

Soaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Iron Pellet Location

The Iron Pellet can be purchased from the Man-In-Stone") after completing his quest in Yellow Wind Ridge. A full walkthrough of the Man-In-Stone's quest can be found on our dedicated page.

Soaks are far more plentiful than the drinks for your gourds. They are scattered throughout the game, across each chapter.

You can also keep track of the Awaken Wine Worm locations and Luoija Fragrant Vine locations, which are key to upgrading your healing potential and Gourd.
