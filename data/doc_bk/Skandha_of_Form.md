# Skandha of Form

Skandha of Form is one of the first Key Items in Black Myth: Wukong you will find. But, you won't be able to use it for the majority of the game until you collect the other Skandha Key Items throughout the chapters. 

_"Man shrinks at odor, but smiles at beauty, which is only natural. Once hidden inside the Buddha's head, this treasure has a secret yet to be revealed"_.
