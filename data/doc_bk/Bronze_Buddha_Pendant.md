# Bronze Buddha Pendant

The Bronze Buddha Pendant is one of the many Curios items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. 

With the Bronze Buddha Pendant equipped your resistance to all Four banes in the game (elemental effects) is increased. 

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Bronze Buddha Pendant Location

The Bronze Buddha Pendant can be found randomly from the Wolf Guardians in The New West. Simply farm them around Longevity Road until the item drops.
