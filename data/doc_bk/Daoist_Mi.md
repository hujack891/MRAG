## Where to Find the Daoist Mi

The Daoist Mi is an initially non-hostile NPC that is found while exploring the secret area in Purple Cloud Mountain -- which you can activate by defeating the Venom Daoist twice both in the Webbed Hollow and Temple of Yellow Flowers.

After resting at the Petalfall Hamlet Shrine, head up the path and across a small bridge to enter the small village. It's now overrun by various Daoists, which shouldn't prove too much of a problem if you take them out one at a time.

However, after climbing some stairs, you'll come across a special Sword Daoist ing a flute, and does not appear hostile. He'll actually ask a favor of you, noting that his fellow Daoists have all been partaking of Amourworm eggs, turning them into undying husks. He'll ask you to seek one out and return it to him.

While it may sound like he's asking you to seek out a Worm Practitioner, in reality any of the Daoists you defeat in this hamlet has a chance to drop the item he seeks. We'll clear the village out before returning to him, but you may also need to rest and respawn them if you don't find one.

However, once you return it to him, he'll reveal that he want the egg's power all to himself, and is willing to kill for it. 

## Daoist Mi Boss Fight and Guide

The Daoist Mi is a stronger version of the Sword Daoists you've encountered all over the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Despite being stronger, he's still kind of a pushover, as he doesn't boast much more than your average enemy, even with two distinct phases.

In his first phase, the Daoist Mi will come at you with flowing sword attacks, some of which can emit projectiles waves of force at range when they perform an upward slash in a reverse grip stance.

While most of their basic attacks are simple two-hit strikes, they can also start a combo with an upward slice creating a projectile wave, dash forward into a lunging strike, before spinning to perform a horizontal sweep with one last projectile wave. 

The good news all of their attacks can be deflected with Rock Solid, and pretty much any spell you have will be effective or stagger them greatly. Just treat them as you would any other Sword Daoist, keeping in mind that their greatly expanded health pool should dissuade you from pressing your attack too long so that you can back off to evade their next moves and regain your stamina.

Somewhat surprisingly, Daoist Mi can also employ the move used by the Red-Haired Yaksha of Chapter 3, performing two quick fist strikes, and then turning around to perform a reverse bicycle kick that can hit especially hard -- but its still nothing as dangerous as the Scorpionlord. 

Once you deplete their health bar, the Daoist Mi will invoke the power of the worm's egg, transforming into a Worm Practitioner for the second phase of this fight. Like before, much of their attack patterns will follow the basic enemy, so there won't be too much of a surprise in store.

Much of the worm's moves rely on stumbling and staggering slashes with their long poisonous appendage, either thrusting forward or dragging it along the ground toward you. While they can be a little unpredictable, they still move very slowly.

The one big new move that Daoist Mi can use in this form is spewing a lot more poison across the arena. In particular, if they arch backwards for a long moment before getting up, they'll run towards you while spewing poison in every possible direction. Knowing this in advance, simply keep your distance or prepare a charged thrust attack to repel them.

With Antimiasma powder on hand, the Daoist Mi won't last long against your superior skills. When you finally defeat him, the snake woman will appear and take the egg back from the fallen Daoist, before giving it to you, in the hopes you can make true use of its power. You'll gain the **Violet Hail Transformation Spell** , allowing you to temporarily turn into a Worm Practitioner yourself and become immune to poison!
