# Gold Spikeplate

The Gold Spikeplate is one of the many Curios items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. 

With the Gold Spikeplate equipped your defense is considerably increased. Additionally, when taking hits, you deal damage to enemies surrounding enemies. 

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Gold Spikeplate Location

The Gold Spikeplate can be found in The New West, specifically within the Valley of Ecstasy, Longevity Road Shrine area. Follow the road along until you reach the Dark-faced Overlord in the back of the area. Defeat it to get the Curios item.
