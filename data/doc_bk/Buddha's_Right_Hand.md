# Buddha's Right Hand

The Buddha's Right Hand is a required Yaoguai Chief boss fight that you can find during Chapter 4 of Black Myth Wukong. Located in the middle section of The Webbed Hollow, this creepy long hand is more than it seems, and blocks the passage down to the Lower Hollow.

## Where to Find the Buddha's Right Hand

The Buddha's Right Hand is an main boss and non-missable encounter that you'll find exploring the massive Webbed Hollow Portion of Chapter 4. After descending down to the Vedure Bridge Shrine and defeating the Centipede Guai in the Bonevault, follow the linear path up to the Cliff of Oblivion. 

Just past the Shrine, you'll find a narrow passageway with a creepy hand holding a mirror, but this is actually the boss fight you seek! 

## Buddha's Right Hand Boss Fight and Guide

When you try to interact with the strange mirror, it will disappear as the hand attached to a very long disturbing arm decides to attack you. This fight is a fairly unorthodox one, and you'll need to expect the unexpected as you face this foe in a very narrow hallway with limited room to dodge.

The strange hand has a few different moves it can use both up close and at range you'll need to become familiar with. One of its opening moves will be to slap the wall near you, but that's not all -- the move will cause several rocks to fall from above, and with your limited visibility you'll need to keep dodging around 3-4 large rocks with the last one often being delayed.

If you see the hand curl into a fist before raising up, be ready for it to slam down on the ground nearby and claw into the ground, before scraping along the a length of the arena in a quick dash.

Doing so will often cause the hand to become immobile for a few moments, so be ready to turn around and chase it to follow up some a few attacks.

If it curls into a fist but doesn't raise up, watch for a gold glow to empower the hand as it punches around in a wide arch to try and trap you against the wall with.

At range, it can also charge up a magical dart that can't be deflected with your staff spin. There's a somewhat quick version where it performs a flicking motion, and a longer charged shot where an aura appears behind the hand. 

Thankfully, there's ample opportunities to attack the hand after many of its attacks, but the fun is only just beginning. 

After you get the Buddha's Right Hand to around half of its health it will retreat, and you'll finally meet the owner of the hand.

The terrifying creature will lunge down with a scream, and then begin to spew a literal river of poison into a narrow arena. This stream of bile will damage you continuously, and there are only two real ways to avoid it. 

If you're quick, you can dash under it before it starts spewing poison to get around behind it. If not, quickly get up onto a Pillar Stance to perch above the poison.

Unfortunately, you won't be able to hide up here forever, as the boss will often start to turn its body, and then slam down its hand onto the poison river, but you can slam down first and run for safety. 

Now that its body is now clinging to the walls in front of you, you'll need to aim for its face, and the Pillar or Thrust Stance can help with that.

However, the monster has a few new moves you'll need to worry about, like being able to stab down with its front legs.

If you notice the monster begin to rise up to where you can't hit it with normal swings, back off and get ready, as it will likely try to punch you with its "right hand" slamming through under its body. The good news is the hand is also another target in addition to its head, giving you more places to swing your staff at.

If the body appears to rise up and lurch backwards out of reach instead of straight up, it means that the boss is preparing to lunge forward with a headbutt, but this can be deflected and countered while its head is lowered for some prime damage output.

The Buddha's Right Hand can also use its hand above to swing its body backward, at which point you'll need to be ready for it to rapidly swing forward and slide through the arena with its talons dragging along. Don't bother trying to deflect it, as you'll just be knocked backward without slowing its momentum.

One of its more annoying new attacks is that it can also retch out a cloud of poison bugs that will fly around in front of its head and deal damage to anything nearby. You may just want to back off instead of pressing the attack during this move to avoid taking unnecessary damage.

Since it won't have too much health left, focus on avoiding its attacks and try to get around its face along the sides to score hits while out of range of many of its attacks, and be ready to dodge falling rocks if it begins shrieking or slamming into walls.

Once you have finally depleted its health, it will try to flee the tunnel and fly away, only to be shot down violently -- forming a bridge with its "hand". Your mysterious lady friend will return to urge you onward before she disappears. 

Defeating this monster will award you an actual Buddha's Right Hand Key Item. Once you locate the Buddha's Left Hand deeper into the Webbed Hollow, you'll be able to bring both to the Shen Monkey in the Zodiac Village to craft a unique Gourd!
