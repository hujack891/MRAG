## Rat Governor Location

The Rat Governor can be found guarding the Rock Clash Platform Meditation Spot. To get there, you will first have to defeat the Stone Vanguard at Rock Clash Platform. After you've bested the giant rocky beast, head through the archway on the side of the arena and activate the Rock Clash Platform Keeper's Shrine. Turn around so the Shrine is to your back and head down the path past the houses to find the Rat Governor.

## Rat Governor Fight

The Rat Governor fights like the other enemies of his kind throughout Yellow Wind Ridge. His main go-to attacks include summoning lightning strikes with his staff and using it to beat you around. The location is kind of difficult to traverse, so luring him up further to a flatter area could help if you're having trouble taking him down.

  * **Tribute**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Thunder Damage.

The Rat Governor's power strikes your foe with lightning summoned from his staff. The equipped effect increases Thunder Damage, making this move even stronger. The Kang-Jin Staff weapon also deals Thunder Damage, so combining that with the Rat Governor Spirit will make the most out of all three effects.
