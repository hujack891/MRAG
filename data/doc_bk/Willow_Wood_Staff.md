# Willow Wood Staff

The Willow Wood Staff is the basic weapon you get at the beginning of Black Myth: Wukong. It comes with standard stats, little damage, and overall isn't much use beyond the initial opening moments of the game. Before long you will want to switch to one of the other Weapons. 

The weapon has a basic 30 damage stat, with no additional critical hit chance bonus. It also doesn't have any unique effect.

With it being given to you at the beginning of Chapter 1 - Black Wind Mountain, you can't craft it. However, it can be crafted into a variety of other weapons as you progress.
