# Ebon Flow

Ebon Flow is one of the Transformation Spells you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Focused on dodging and deflecting attacks to then follow those actions up with powerful attacks, Ebon Flow can easily be missed within The New West as it is a part of a long quest chain. 

The spell allows you to transform into the Yin Tiger to ward off incoming blows by holding the sword horizontally, or dashing forward like a gale to close in on foes. Focus is then built up before transformation can be converted for use afterward. Ebon Flow's moveset is as follows: 

  * **Light attack: Onslaught Blade - Raise the Great Iron Blade to strike the target, building up focus with each hit.** As Focus increases, enemies are more easily staggered with this series of attacks that raises your Great Iron Blade.
  * **Heavy attack: Rift Cleaver - Hold Heavy Attack to unleash a powerful cleave, deling massive damage.** The more Focus built up, the more devastating the damage becomes with this attack, which is a slow, powerful slam. 
  * **Deflection: Blacksmith - Raise the blade to deflect assaults, build up Focus with each deflection, or dodge to switch to other moves.** This is one of the only defensive moves a Transformation Spell has, building Focus with each hit and allowing you to mitigate damage.

## **Black Myth: Wukong Ebon Flow Location**

As mentioned, finding Ebon Flow is long-winded, consisting of multiple steps across locations. To find the Ebon Flow Transformation in Black Myth: Wukong, you will need to:

  * Return to Chen Loong and enter the Zodiac Village upon obtaining the Ruyi Scroll") from him

To save Xu Dog, you will need to head through the cave, just next to the Village Entrance Shrine in Sandgate Village in Yellow Wind Ridge.

Beneath Xu Dog you can find a small pond with Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, whom you will need to defeat.

Once you have killed Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw, talk to Xu Dog once again, and he will move to the Cellar location in Crouching Tiger Temple. This can only be accessed by interacting with the Tally in the Tiger Vanguard arena fight, and heading into the temple through the staircase that opens. 

You will need to defeat the Tiger Vanguard and Stone Vanguard to obtain the Keeness of Tiger and Sterness of Stone in order to use the Tally. Both of these bosses are mandatory bosses within Yellow Wind Ridge.

With this area accessed, now you need to  through the majority of Chapter 3 - The New West, until you step off Turtle Island within Bitter Lake. Once off the island and at the North Shore Shrine, head to your left, along the coastline to find Chen Loong.

Defeat him using our Chen Loong boss guide. Once defeated, he will become friendly and you will be able to talk to him. He will ask you for some medicine to help him. This can be obtained from Xu Dog by just talking with him back at the Cellar Shrine in the Crouching Tiger Temple. With it, you can then return to Chen Loong, who will give you Ruyi Scroll"), teleporting you to the Zodiac Village. 

In the Zodiac Village, you can talk to Yin Tiger, who is a blacksmith sitting amongst the other merchants.

Upon talking to Yin Tiger, you can choose to have a duel, which starts a boss battle. Our breakdown of the Yin Tiger boss has a detailed overview of the moves to watch out for and tips to succeed. If you are successful at taking down Yin Tiger, you will obtain the Ebon Flow Transformation.
