### See Both Endings

However, if you want to see both endings, we'd recommend completing Chapter 6 of the game first. When you've beaten the final boss and viewed the original ending, press CONTINUE, rather than start a new cycle and follow the steps below to see the secret ending. 

  1. Go to The Great Pagoda in The New West (Chapter 3)
  2. Find the little Buddha and enter Mount Mei
  3. Defeat Erlang, The Sacred Divinity
