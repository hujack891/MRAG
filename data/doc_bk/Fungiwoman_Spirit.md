## Fungiwoman Location

The Fungiwoman can be found near the Temple of the Yellow Flowers. From the temple entrance, take the path on the left and head up the stairs, taking out enemies as you go. You will come across a small, concrete clearing with two Snake Herbalists and a couple of centipedes to defeat. 

Defeat the enemies and run to the back of the clearing. Turn right and make your way up the hill to reach another small clearing containing a shack and three mushrooms. One of these mushrooms is the Fungiwoman.

## Fungiwoman Fight

The Fungiwoman fight is rather difficult, thanks to her unique skills. To begin with, she has a poisonous staff that she will use to smack you. She can also spin around with the staff at very high speeds, creating a swirling vortex of pain that flings you across the battlefield if you get hit by it. She gets dizzy after this attack, giving you a good opportunity to counter with an attack of your own. 

This is bad enough already, but she also has an attack where she shoots spores out over the arena that target and hurt you. These spores replenish the Fungiwoman's health. The trick here is to fight aggressively so she doesn't have time to replenish much HP. Otherwise, it can drag on for a very long time.

  * **Aloft**
  * Equipped Effect: Significantly increases Maximum Health but considerably reduces Maximum Stamina. 

The Fungiwoman's Spirit allows you to take the form of the Fungiwoman and float through the air, releasing spores as you go. These spores can potentially replenish your health as well as deal massive damage to your foes. Since you float through the air for the majority of the attack, you can also avoid taking damage from moves that can't reach you. The equipped effect increases your Health while slightly decreasing your Stamina. Depending on your style, this might be a fair exchange.
