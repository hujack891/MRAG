# Folk Set

The Folk set of Armor and Gear in Black Myth: Wukong consists of four Uncommon pieces. It is basic, with no special stats or unique effects, and is only available to those who have the Deluxe Edition of the game. The Folk Set of Armor and Gear comes with: 

  * Folk Opera Mask (headgear) - 7 Defense
  * Folk Opera Almsgiving Armor (body) - 14 Defense
  * Folk Opera Leather Bracers (arms) - 5 Defense
  * Folk Opera, Buskins (legs) - 8 Defense

The Set Bonus for the Folk Set is: 

  * Every Bit Counts - Moderately increases the Will gained from defeating the enemy (4 pieces equipped)

All of these pieces of armor are automatically unlocked at the start of Chapter 1 - Black Wind Mountain. You can pick them up from the first Shrine at the Forest of Wolves under the "Trailblazer's Gifts" tab. You can't find these items in-game, as they purely serve as some extra protection to get through the initial sections of the game if you purchased the Deluxe Edition.

The Folk Set of Armor and Gear can't be crafted, as it is a bonus set of gear and not a part of the main game's set.
