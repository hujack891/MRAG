# Flame Orb

The Flame Orb is one of the many Curios items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. 

With the Flame Orb equipped your Burn resistance is moderately increased, which is especially useful in the Flaming Mountains. 

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Flame Orb Location

The Flame Orb is dropped upon defeating the Rusty-Gold Cart in The Flaming Mountains.
