# Xiang River Goddess Gourd

The Xiang River Goddess Gourd is a Legendary Gourd in Black Myth: Wukong, located in The Webbed Hollow. It is one of the Gourds in the game that has the most uses by default: 8 to be exact. Unfortunately, it can't be upgraded beyond this at the Shen Monkey Vendor, but it is still incredibly strong late in the game. 

Using the Gourd grants a moderate amount of Burn Resistance, ensuring you can't have your health peeled away by fire attacks. You also gain immunity from lava-covered terrain for a short duration. This makes the Gourd incredibly useful in Chapter 5, within The Flaming Mountains.
