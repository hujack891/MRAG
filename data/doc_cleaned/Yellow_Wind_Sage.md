As the main objective of Chapter 2's Yellow Wind Ridge, you'll need to defeat the Yellow Wind Sage to put a stop to the chaos in this region. However, the sage has locked himself within the center of the Yellow Wind Formation area, and each door leading to him is locked requiring two Key Items. 

The Sterness of Stone can be gained by defeating the Stone Vanguard in the Fright Cliff Region. 

The Keeness of Tiger can be gained by defeating the Tiger Vanguard in the Crouching Tiger Temple Region.

With both pieces, you can open the door where you defeated the King of Flowing Sands, or open up the temple cellar in the Crouching Tiger Temple, or slide down past the Rock Crash Platform to the Windseal Gate. 

## Yellow Wind Sage Boss Fight and Guide

The final boss of Chapter 2 is a hulking rat who holds an incredible trident spear in one hand, while the other carries… a giant head? If you think this may limit his moves, you’re unfortunately in for a rude awakening. The Yellow Wind Sage has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, and is not only a deadly attacker, but a master of the Samadhi Winds — but more on that later. 

Make sure you're suitably prepared for the fight in the best ways possible: Craft a bunch of medicine to increase your damage absorption and max health, and allocate any Mind Cores you’ve found toward Celestial Medicine buffs. You should also have a full set of either the Galeguard or Insect armor fully crafted, as well as the Cloud-Patterened Stone Staff from defeating the optional Sihandang boss. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you’ve beaten the Chapter 2 Secret Boss and equipped the new Vessel, the Wind Tamer.

Using his giant weapon, the Yellow Wind Sage is able to create huge waves of force by slashing his trident spear, sending out wide projectile slices your way. He’ll often perform two in a row from an upward slash followed by a horizontal slash, and then a delay before jumping upward to create a third vertical slash and send the wave of force your way.

One of his bigger attacks with a slow startup involves him performing a backhanded swing where he spins around first. Watch his movements, and you’ll be able to go Rock Solid to parry this move and stagger him, opening up to a large counter attack!

However, attacking from the front can often prove dangerous, as you don’t want to drain all your stamina and run out of juice for dodging. He can often lure you in, and then stab his imbued weapon down right in front of him. Don’t dodge backward but instead flee to the sides, as the impact will create a line of smaller spears from the sand itself that erupt in a straight line from the point of impact. 

You can get in a few strikes after dodging this stab, but save your heavy attack, as the Yellow Wind Sage will usually follow this up by a jumping stomp attack to create a shockwave around him. This will leave him open for a strong heavy hit and follow up attacks. 

![Wukong Yellow 55.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ac/Wukong_Yellow_55.jpg)

Another frontal assault the boss can perform will start with three quick downward swings of his weapon aimed at his feet. Right after his final swing, he’ll pull his weapon up and leap straight into the air, and then slam back down with another vertical slice that will erupt spears in a straight line when he lands, so keep strafing around to hit his sides. 

![Wukong Yellow 57.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/59/Wukong_Yellow_57.jpg)

Even carrying that bulky head, the Yellow Wind Sage will be quick to retaliate when you try to attack from other sides. Expect him to perform a retreating slash aimed behind him while jumping away if you try to flank him. 

![Wukong Yellow 56.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7f/Wukong_Yellow_56.jpg)

He can also do a very quick jab with the butt of his trident that comes after the end of the weapon glows for a moment, and he’ll soon follow it with a stomp that’ll be hard to dodge if staggered by the first attack. If you spot the other end of his spear glowing, you should have enough time to parry it with Rock Solid when he jabs, and interrupt his follow up attack! 

![Wukong Yellow 58.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/05/Wukong_Yellow_58.jpg)

Once you’ve carved out around a third of the Yellow Wind Sage’s health bar, things will get a little more scary. He’ll suddenly toss the head into the sky, and begin to sweep his spear around him to create a giant sandstorm — the power of the Samahdi Winds. Stay very clear of his repeated swings when this happens, as he’ll end the move with a giant whirling spin attack. 

![Wukong Yellow 62.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bb/Wukong_Yellow_62.jpg)  
Note - if you have the Wind Tamer, you can use it now to fully negate the sandstorm and stop it from happening, which will also force him out of many of the attacks he uses in this phase. As an added bonus, using the Wind Tamer will also stun him for an extended period, so make use of it by hitting him with your biggest charged heavy strikes! 

If you don’t have the Wind Tamer, he’ll vanish into the sandstorm, and instead send out giant sand copies of himself to strike at you in different directions. Since they are copies, you can’t really counter attack them, and they’ll fade away right after attacking: 

![Wukong Yellow 59.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d3/Wukong_Yellow_59.jpg)

  * One version will run up to you with its free hand glowing and swing it upwards to trigger a line of sand spears to explode up from the ground. It will then launch into several sweeping attacks with its spear

![Wukong Yellow 60.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fd/Wukong_Yellow_60.jpg)

  * Another version will dropkick its way into the arena sending it to the far side, and then come roaring back with a spinning jump slash back at you as a quick follow-up attack.

When you finally spot the real version of him performing a leaping stomp back into the arena, he’ll have changed his stance, now holding the spear in a reverse grip. 

![Wukong Yellow 63.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/09/Wukong_Yellow_63.jpg)

In this new phase, he’ll have a few new moves to contend with, and they can get pretty nasty. He has a lot more kicking and stomping attacks, often raising his foot for a moment or even jumping off the ground to hang low to the ground, and then bringing it down hard. If his hand or foot begin to glow, it often means he’ll raise up more spears soon after, so be ready. 

![Wukong Yellow 64.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e9/Wukong_Yellow_64.jpg)

The most annoying move will lock you into an extended grab if you get hit, and has little warning. You’ll need to watch for him to stop and growl, going into a slight crouch before running toward you. He’ll then try and punt you with his right foot, and if connects, you’ll sail into the air only to be pinned down into the ground by his trident, where he’ll give you another stomp for good measure before tossing your body aside, dealing major damage through the whole process. 

![Wukong Yellow 67.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/01/Wukong_Yellow_67.jpg)

One of the more terrifying attacks in this phase comes when the Yellow Wind Sage lets out a large roar. This will summon a new sand creation to come flying in from above, and if you beat the secret boss in the Kingdom of Sahalin you’ll recognize the towering form of Fuban the Scarab Guai. He’ll essentially crash down on you like a meteor, which will either require good timing with a dodge or try to Rock Solid and soak the blow. Just be wary that if you get hit, you’ll take a huge amount of damage! 

![Wukong Yellow 65.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/be/Wukong_Yellow_65.jpg)

If you see the spear tip glow behind the Yellow Wind Sage’s back, be ready for him to sweep the weapon out and then slam the trident down for another of his erupting sand spear attacks in a line. 

![Wukong Yellow 66.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ef/Wukong_Yellow_66.jpg)

He can now also perform huge retreating slashes, jumping over you and slashing downward as he flees to the other side of the arena. Don’t bother trying to parry the move or Immobilize him since you won’t be able to retaliate, and be ready for him to come back with a spinning air slash. 

![Wukong Yellow 68.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0a/Wukong_Yellow_68.jpg)

He can also create a glow in his hand before throwing it into the ground. He’ll then stab the spot with his spear, and cause a giant tremor all around him when he rips the spear out. The time it takes for this move is a bit lengthy, so if you’re feeling gutsy you can try to interrupt him with a big charged hit or Spirit Attack, Immobilize him, or even use the Pillar Stance charge attack to rise above the tremor and smack him after evading it. 

![Wukong Yellow 69.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b5/Wukong_Yellow_69.jpg)

The Yellow Wind Sage also has a tricky feint where he’ll appear to run past you, but then lunge back into a sliding swipe with his arm. If timed correctly, you can cast Rock Solid just as he lunges back after the feint, which will often knock him to the ground and let you get a decent amount of damage in as he struggles to get up. 

![Wukong Yellow 71.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e3/Wukong_Yellow_71.jpg)

Once he’s down to the last quarter of health, he’ll prepare another sandstorm and grab the head back from where it’s been floating up above. During this period he’ll also summon a sand tornado to move around the arena, which you’ll need to avoid at all costs — especially if the Wind Tamer hasn’t recharged enough to use it again. 

![Wukong Yellow 72.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b0/Wukong_Yellow_72.jpg)

He’ll use most of his original attacks from this point on, though many are imbued with more powerful slashes, and he can continue to summon sand phantoms to stomp down on you even if you’ve dispelled the storm. 

![Wukong Yellow 61.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/18/Wukong_Yellow_61.jpg)

If you’re having trouble pinning him down, the Thrust Stance can be handy here for striking at him with heavy charged hits after he likes to dance backward after striking, since it will often still be in range. 

![Wukong Yellow 70.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d1/Wukong_Yellow_70.jpg)

A fully charged heavy thrust with a few focus points built up can also usually stagger him to the ground, and give you plenty more time to follow up with big hits, Spirit attacks, and Transformation Spells (we recommend sticking with Red Tides due to his mobility for chasing him down). 

![Wukong Yellow 73.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/24/Wukong_Yellow_73.jpg)

When the giant rat sage finally falls to your weapon, an unexpected twist will happen as the owner of the head suddenly appears to claim that which had been taken.
