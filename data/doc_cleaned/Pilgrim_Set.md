# Pilgrim Set

The Pilgrim set of Armor and Gear in Black Myth: Wukong consists of four Uncommon pieces. It is basic, with no special stats. Although, it does have a Unique Effect. The Pilgrim Set of Armor and Gear comes with: 

  * Pilgrim's Headband (headgear) - 8 Defense, Allows using the Gourd while sprinting
  * Pilgrim's Garb (body) - 16 Defense
  * Pilgrim's Wristwraps (arms) - 6 Defense
  * Pilgrim's Legwraps (legs) - 10 Defense

The Set Bonus for the Pilgrim Set is: 

  * Swift Pilgrim - Moderately increases sprint speed (2 pieces equipped)
  * When Sprinting, each second moderately increases attack. This effect can stack up to 10 times. (4 pieces equipped)

All of these pieces of armor are automatically unlocked upon reaching the Guanyin Temple Shrine in Forest of Wolves in Chapter 1 - Black Wind Mountain. You can craft them from this Shrine and any of the others once you reach it early on in Chapter 1.
