There are 4 Purple Talismans to find. You can pick up 3 of them throughout the Webbed Hollow, and the last one is collected from the Temple of the Yellow Flowers. You'll find a detailed walkthrough below of where to get each one. 

### Important Note!

Do this **before** you complete the Chapter and beat the final boss. Otherwise, you might be locked out from fighting the hidden boss.

Face away from the Middle Hollow Keeper's Shrine, and go straight up, turning right and taking the stairs and slope up near the green-covered rocks.

Go straight on past the white sacs, and then turn left. You'll see a bridge here and a building on the other side.

As you approach, a cutscene will begin. You'll be able to take the Talisman from the altar straight after. 

### Purple Talisman 2 - Cliff of Oblivion

This one is just to the right of the Cliff of Oblivion Keeper's Shrine (when you're facing it). You'll find the Altar in the water. 

### Purple Talisman 3 - Relief of the Fallen Loong

Go behind the Relief of the Fallen Loong Keeper's Shrine, up the raggedy pathway that's lined with broken logs and rocks. You should be able to see a torch glowing near the top.

Pass through the area covered in webbing, then follow the path, going up and around to the right. When you get to the top, you'll see a big tree and rock with twisted roots in it.

Take the path off to the left, and the altar is just behind.

The final Talisman can be found when you reach the end of the Temple of Yellow Flowers, in the Court of Illumination. Take the path that leads to a set of stairs behind the Keeper's Shrine. 

![Purple Talismans Chapter 4 \(11\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/22/Purple_Talismans_Chapter_4_%2811%29.png)

This will lead you to a courtyard, where the last altar and Talisman is. You'll hear someone shout "Run!" as you approach. 

## What Happens When You Collect All 4 Talismans?

When you collect the final Talisman, the Altar will disappear and a boss called the Supreme Inspector will emerge. Fight for as long as you can and a cutscene will begin. The Supreme Inspector will be taken away by the Crane Immortal who emerges, and the fight will end here. 

When it's over, you can collect a Celestial Nonary Pill from the box behind the fight area and will achieve the trophy Misfit with Merit.
