## Non-White Location

Non-White is a boss you will encounter naturally as you progress through the story. After interacting with the Child Buddha, you will be tasked with finding and resonating with the four Buddha statues hidden around the area. Once you've done that, head up the steps at the back of the clearing to enter the cave system.

Non-White will run away after you get his health bar about halfway down, but you will shortly come across him again deeper in the cave. 

## Non-White Fight

Non-White fights with a double-ended blade that deals ice damage. He can also cast ice spells with it that summon a trail of razor-sharp icicles to rise from the ground. The key to Non-White is anticipating his blows as he winds up and perfect dodging out of the way before they hit you. You could also consider taking some Body-Warming Powder into the fight with you to combat Chill.

  * **Bone Spikes**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Poison and Frost Damage.

Non-White's Spirit Power allows you to take the form of Non-White and rush close to the enemy, leaving a trail of poisonous gas in your wake. Once you're closer to the enemy, you'll roll up into a ball and sprout spikes from your body to stab the enemy with. This is a strong attack that is even further enhanced by the equipped effect that bolsters your poison and frost damage.
