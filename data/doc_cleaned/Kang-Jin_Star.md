# Kang-Jin Star

## Where to Find Kang-Jin Star

Kang-Jin Star is a formidable and umissable boss you'll need to defeat to free Zhu Bajie from being imprisoned in a giant pair of cymbls. You can reach this boss by making your way through the Pagoda Realm and through the Temple of Warding and out the back to a large slope you can slide down onto Turtle Island. 

### Kang-Jin Star Boss Fight and Guide

Like the other Kang-Jin, expect this fight to involve a heaping helping of electricity, and stock up accordingly on Shock-Quelling medicine, or you'll be taking a lot of damage. Though all of her attacks involve lightning, some can come at close range while others come at a distance, meaning there are benefits to either Rock Solid or Cloud Step. Similarly, the new Ring of Fire Spell can help you retreat to a spot to heal, but won't protect against her projectiles, so it may be better to use Immobilize instead.

When the battle starts, Kang-Jin Star will often summon small serpent-like electric projectiles to swim around her in the air before sending them your way. Watch her movement to see when she directs them so you'll know when to dodge their quick movement. 

This boss doesn't move all that much, though she can teleport, meaning you'll be able to close the distance quite fast, but Kang-Jin Star will use a lot of spells to keep you at arms length.

Often after proclaiming "Tremors forge thunder" she can create electrical spots on the ground to erupt with lightning after a moment. The problem is these rings will follow you for a moment before she enacts the strike, so again you'll need to watch when she crackles with light to know the strike is coming and dodge it. At the start of the fight you'll only have to dodge one, but over time she'll do more and more of these for the first part of her attack. 

She'll often follow up these strikes by finishing her sentence with "clashes form bolts" and then toss a projectile straight at you from her hand, requiring a second dodge before can get close and retaliate.

Even when you get in close range to fight, she has a few close-range lightning attacks to deal with. One starts with another mantra "Spin..." causing her to slash at you with lightning sweeps in two quick attacks, before performing a third attack while yelling "and flush!" This third attack can take the form of a floating downward slash, or creating a cross slash in front of her that moves outward. Whichever it is, a Cloud Step can let you bypass her attack by dodging to the side and then hit her from the flank.

Other times, watch her hand movements when attacking up close -- if she waves them around with electric energy before holding them at her side, be ready for an extremely quick lightning burst she'll slam down in front of her to block your advance. 

![Wukong Turtle 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5c/Wukong_Turtle_6.jpg)

After taking a bit of damage, she can teleport away to appear high up in the air. Often times, this will start by turning into a larger electrical dragon resembling Kang-Jin Loong. 

When she's far away, she'll roar to create a lightning storm of sorts, causing large spear-like projectiles to hit the ground with an electric explosion, and only a moment's warning for where they'll strike. 

![Wukong Turtle 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e9/Wukong_Turtle_7.jpg)

Later on, Kang-Jin Star will appear much closer above you in her dragon form, and use a familiar tail slam to explode the ground around you. Luckily, not only can you dodge or deflect this, but you can then strafe to the right to attack the dragon's head before she transforms back. 

![Wukong Turtle 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f1/Wukong_Turtle_8.jpg)

Another terrifying attack she can commence when you're at close range comes when she proclaims "Yield... to your true self!". Floating in the air, she'll create a large electric dome around her that continues to expand, meaning you'll want to break off the attack and retreat to a safe distance. 

Note that the field will also generate an electric ring along the ground to reach even farther that you'll need to jump or pillar stance over - but it also only moves along a flat horizontal axis, and standing on rocks or slope can often cause it to go under you. 

![Wukong Turtle 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/dd/Wukong_Turtle_9.jpg)

When appearing to float up above you, watch carefully if she summons an electrical imbued spike in her hand. She'll fly down close to throw it at the ground, and even if you dodge you'll need to watch for when it creates a tremor to explode the ground around it. 

![Wukong Turtle 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/dd/Wukong_Turtle_10.jpg)

At around half health, she'll start to get madder, and teleport high up to summon several groups of electrical bolts that will fly out in small clusters to track you down. You can't deflect them with your staff, so either use Cloud Step or stick to dodging. 

After this, she'll trigger a thunderstorm that darkens the arena, filling you the area with static electricity and most likely giving you the Shocked status effect. Take a moment to use a Shock-Quelling medicine. 

![Wukong Turtle 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2f/Wukong_Turtle_11.jpg)

Right after she inflicts you with Shock, she'll trigger an even bigger lightning storm to try and maximize her damage against you, which is another good time to make yourself scarce with Cloud Step, and otherwise keep running around to avoid the attacks. 

![Wukong Turtle 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cd/Wukong_Turtle_12.jpg)

Expect her to get more aggressive in this second half, expelling more lightning at the end of some of her close-combat attacks that require more dodging and less room for counters. You can still use Immobilize to keep her from floating away, however. 

![Wukong Turtle 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/78/Wukong_Turtle_13.jpg)

Another move she can now perform in her enhanced state is to expel a bunch of those serpent-like electric projectiles straight up from her body, which will twist in the air before coming back down to track you, and will require you taking some evasive action. 

![Wukong Turtle 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/da/Wukong_Turtle_14.jpg)

Finally (and possibly most terrifyingly), she can hover high into the air and create a giant group of her electrified spears all around her, sending volleys of them outward in several directions to track you down. Try not to panic, and use Cloud Step to give her the slip, or keep strafing and dodging as much as you can. 

![Wukong Turtle 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/39/Wukong_Turtle_15.jpg)

After the spears have been thrown out from around her, she'll summon one last giant spear in her hand, and leap down towards you to pierce you with it. 

![Wukong Turtle 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9c/Wukong_Turtle_16.jpg)

Quickly dodge to the side, and keep your distance as the embedded spear will explode after a short moment, sending rocks up all around it. 

![Wukong Turtle 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a6/Wukong_Turtle_17.jpg)

The good news is this attack is so powerful it will leave her incredibly drained, and give you plenty of time to retaliate with all your saved up focus points, a Spirit Attack, and anything else you can throw at her! 

![Wukong Turtle 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/70/Wukong_Turtle_18.jpg)

As long as your patient to wait for the right moments to get in close and attack, and make sure you're using shock-quelling medicine, you'll be able to come out on top. Even as Kang-Jin Star tries to flee in her dragon form, the Destined One will see to it that she crashes into the large cymbals, freeing the prisoner inside!
