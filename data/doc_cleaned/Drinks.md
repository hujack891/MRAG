# Drinks

Black Myth: Wukong has a selection of different Drinks you can equip that change the Gourdâ€™s behavior. From restoring your health quickly, restoring it over time, or in alternative ways, the drink options allow you to pick an option that suits your playstyle. 

These Gourd Drinks are rare in the game, and there are only a few different options to be found, mostly through exploration. You can also find individual Gourds and Soaks that provide additional perks.
