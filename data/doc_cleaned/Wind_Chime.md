# Wind Chime

The Wind Chime is a Curios item that is rather exclusive in Black Myth: Wukong. You can get the Wind Chime Curios from purchasing the Deluxe Edition of the game or the Deluxe Edition upgrade pack. 

The Wind Chime will slightly increase your movement speed when it is equipped, providing a noticeable but not drastic buff.

Curios in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, you will want to switch to other Curios items to better fit your build as you play. This can be done at any point from the Equipment menu. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Wind Chime Location

The Wind Chime can be obtained from the first Shrine, Front Hills, in the Forest of Wolves in Black Wind Mountain. It is located just after the initial couple of enemies before the bamboo bridge and is hard to miss.

At this spot, you can pick up the Trailblazer Deluxe Edition weapon and Deluxe Edition gear and equipment too, alongside this Curios item.
