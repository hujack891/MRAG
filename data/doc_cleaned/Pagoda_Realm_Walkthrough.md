After winning the battle against Kang-Jin Loong, you'll be swept up and thrown into a jail of sorts, in a new region known as The Pagoda Realm. Thankfully you'll be able to open your cell door without much trouble, but it will be long climb to get out of here. 

Stepping out into this eerie dungeon, you'll find that this part of the Pagoda Realm is a prison made up of several circular tiers that comprise both an inner walkway ring, and an outer ring for cells, hallways, and stairs -- all circling a large pagoda (and that's not even the titular one) made to look like a mani wheel (or prayer wheel), as its slowly revolving and featuring large statues on every side. 

![Wukong Pagoda 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/24/Wukong_Pagoda_2.jpg)

As you begin to step out onto the inner walkway, a voice will call out from the next cell, which has a mysterious purple seal you can't break. You can still speak to the person inside, sitting against a wall next to a dead Rat Captain. 

They'll warn you against trying to make your own way, but you can't exactly do nothing. Still, it pays to heed their warning -- this place is not going to be easy to traverse, especially with minds "ebbing away with the tides of chants". 

![Wukong Pagoda 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/48/Wukong_Pagoda_3.jpg)

Be extra wary when exploring this area, as there are many Cyan Bats hiding up on ceilings. They'll divebomb you with little warning, and explode with ice to harass you as you deal with other threats. 

Past the first Cyan Bat, be sure to check the first open cell on the left to find a Wisp to absorb, and a Snake-Head Mushroom to harvest. 

# The Beguiling Chant of the Pagoda Realm

![Wukong Pagoda 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/16/Wukong_Pagoda_4.jpg)  
It's around this point that you'll likely get your first taste of the "beguiling chants" the prisoner mentioned, and there's a lot going on you'll have to make sense of. A large terrifying sound will echo throughout the realm, the pagoda itself will spin even faster, everyone will start glowing, strange new creatures will appear -- and your health will start lowering!  
Let's break it down: The Pagoda Realm's chanting curse is on a global timer, meaning even if you die or go to different Shines in the realm, or even sit around resting at a shrine, the curse can still trigger and persist. **Every three minutes, the chanting will begin, and last for exactly one minute and thirty seconds before resetting.**  
![Wukong Pagoda 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/65/Wukong_Pagoda_5.jpg)

During this time, your maximum health will be halved! However, there is a silver lining: The curse will actually slowly refill your entire health bar before starting to lower your maximum health bar (but will still account for damage you've taken if you're currently in a fight and not regenerate past that point). As an added caveat, both the Destined One and all other enemies in the Pagoda Realm will start to glow red. This not only makes enemies easier to spot, but also grants everyone a considerable damage boost -- which can be blessing or a curse depending on who you are facing.  
![Wukong Pagoda 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f3/Wukong_Pagoda_6.jpg)

Finally, during this period, strange new enemies will appear along several of the inner ring walkways. These sentries have tall lantern-shaped heads, and will try to grab you and throw you into the pit if they spot you, which is an instant death!The only way to stop this beguiling chant from continuing to manifest is to defeat the boss at the top of the Pagoda, and it will take some work to get there! 

Be wary of Frozen Corpses along this walkway that can come to life and jump at you with their sword, but also of the Lantern Wardens that appear when the beguiling chant's curse begins. There are two in this area, and will slowly patrol back forth while swiveling their heads around casting spotlights on the ground. Should you step in one, you'll be stunned for a moment as they approach to attack. Dodge before they perform their sweeping head attack or you'll be knocked into the realm's pit. 

![Wukong Pagoda 54.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a9/Wukong_Pagoda_54.jpg)

Instead, use your Immobilize spell to lock them down and try attacking from behind, and watch out for their head slamming attacks. 

![Wukong Pagoda 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b0/Wukong_Pagoda_7.jpg)

If you see them perform a hand gesture, expect them to disappear, only to reappear from a different angle to try and kick you without warning. 

## Lower Pagoda (Level 1)

![Wukong Pagoda 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/00/Wukong_Pagoda_8.jpg)

Past another sealed cell, you can finally find the Lower Pagoda Shrine to rest at, but remember that resting at it will not affect the timer of this area's curse. It's not a bad idea to rest at it after the beguiling chant ends and your maximum health returns to normal, but resting during the curse won't reset your health. 

![Wukong Pagoda 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Wukong_Pagoda_9.jpg)

Past the Shrine, the path will lead into the cells, and a long tunnel through the dark. Up ahead, be wary of a Yaksha Archer who will try and bait you into charging him, only for a Cyan Bat above him to divebomb you from behind with its ice attack. 

![Wukong Pagoda 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Wukong_Pagoda_10.jpg)

Just past the duo, you'll find an open gate leading back to the outer ring, while the interior passageway also continues. If you dip out for a moment, you can look right back the way you came to find two enemies guarding a green Wisp by a pile of rubble with another Yaksha Archer at the top. 

![Wukong Pagoda 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f0/Wukong_Pagoda_11.jpg)

Evade the fighters below and hop up the rubble, and use a jumping heavy attack to boost up to the platform and kill the archer first. The giant sword-wielding enemy below is a Blade Monk, who can unleash powerful but slow blade swings and even send out waves of force with their swing, so engage carefully -- especially if you're health is halved! 

![Wukong Pagoda 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6a/Wukong_Pagoda_12.jpg)

The interior tunnel will end with a sealed cell gate, as well as a Starved Abomination that will try to ambush you from a corner. Let the creature tire itself out swinging wildly with its sickle before taking it down with just a few hits. 

![Wukong Pagoda 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/29/Wukong_Pagoda_13.jpg)

If you head along the outside path, you'll find another open jail cell bars to re-enter the interior hall and reach another green Wisp, but be ready to deal with the ambushing Cyan Bat above and Abomination below. 

![Wukong Pagoda 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e4/Wukong_Pagoda_14.jpg)

You'll have to take the outside path to proceed further, but be ready for the beguiling chant to reveal two more Lantern Sentries that patrol this section, and take them out carefully when their backs are turned. 

![Wukong Pagoda 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a4/Wukong_Pagoda_15.jpg)

When you reach an open cell gate ahead with a small lantern posted above it, that's an indication that you've reached a stairway in the interior section that leads to the next level up. 

Before you head up, keep progressing forward to find another Blade Monk by the ledge. Since he's facing away, you can actually hit him from behind with a charged thrust attack to send him into the pit! 

![Wukong Pagoda 16X.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/30/Wukong_Pagoda_16X.jpg)

Behind where the Blade Monk is, you can find a statue with an altar and a tiny chest that holds a **Fine China Tea Bowl Curio**. 

![Wukong Pagoda 17X.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f3/Wukong_Pagoda_17X.jpg)

Next, head past the stairs to continue along the cell tunnel to find a dead end with one more Blade Monk guarding a **Treasure Chest** with assorted materials inside. 

## Lower Pagoda (Level 2)

![Wukong Pagoda 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b7/Wukong_Pagoda_18.jpg)

Making your way up the long stairs to the second level, be ready for a Yaksha Archer to take potshots at you from above, and deflect them with some staff-spinning. 

![Wukong Pagoda 19X.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6a/Wukong_Pagoda_19X.jpg)

As you head outside, mind the Frozen Corpse, and look to the left first. There's a nearby open cell door you can find that has a **Treasure Chest** containing a few materials, guarded by a Withered Corpse. 

Beyond this lone cell, you can find the outside walkway path abruptly ends near a Frozen Corpse, and a darkened pit holds a series of rocky platforms you can drop down. The only thing down here at the moment is a cell with a purple seal, and a route back to where you first arrived in the Pagoda Realm, so unless you really want the green Wisp hovering over the drop back down to the start, it's better to leave this area for later. 

![Wukong Pagoda 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a7/Wukong_Pagoda_20.jpg)

Back at the top of the stairs to the second level, head along the outside path to the right this time. The first open cell as you head this direction will have a green Wisp to absorb to replenish some of your gourd's healing charges. 

![Wukong Pagoda 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Wukong_Pagoda_21.jpg)

Continue past the next open area with a Frozen Corpse and Cyan Bat hiding nearby, and you'll pass another cell with a purple seal that holds a strong enemy with a Spirit inside. There's another Cyan Bat guarding this door, and an Abomination not far ahead waiting to lunge at you. 

![Wukong Pagoda 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fe/Wukong_Pagoda_22.jpg)

You'll need to cross a thin wooden beam next, and to make matters worse, a Yaksha Archer will be posted at the far end to harass you. Resist the urge to perform a mobile Staff Spin, as walking while spinning seems to automatically make you lurch to the side, and you'll plummet to your death. 

Instead, either stop moving to deflect, or take the blows and race to the other side -- but do take a moment to glance to the right at a large purple-lit chamber you can spy ominously through the bars. 

Clear out the archer and the nearby Frozen Corpse after you finish crossing (thankfully the archer won't respawn once killed), and grab a nearby green Wisp to absorb before the outside path crumbles away, forcing you to head into the cell tunnel ring to keep moving forward. 

Move slowly through the darkened hall and be ready for ambushes from Abominations, Withered Corpses, and Cyan Bats on the ceiling. 

![Wukong Pagoda 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ae/Wukong_Pagoda_23.jpg)

Not far after them, you'll encounter an Enslaved Yaksha. You can think of him as the Frozen Corpse in his prime, as he uses a similar very long sword, and can sweep in wide arcs with it, or thrust forward with a huge amount of reach. Luckily, his attacks are all very slow, and easily baited into a Rock Solid deflection. 

![Wukong Pagoda 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Wukong_Pagoda_24.jpg)

Up ahead, you'll finally spot the staircase leading up to level 3 that are guarded by an Abomination, but before you head up there's an optional and challenging encounter further down the hall. 

![Wukong Pagoda 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ae/Wukong_Pagoda_25.jpg)

Keep proceeding past the stairs to find a Snake-Head Mushroom to harvest, and look left through an open cell gate to spy a Blade Monk perched outside on the ledge that you can poke off with a thrust attack. 

If you head to the end of the cells, you'll find a green Wisp to absorb, and a ledge outside leading back down to a small outcropping below with a second green Wisp, and a one-way drop back to the very start (we'd recommend grabbing the next Shrine at the top of the stairs to Level 3 first). 

![Wukong Pagoda 26X.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c7/Wukong_Pagoda_26X.jpg)

If you look to the left of where the Blade Monk was posted to find a section leading back the way you came on the outside ledge. This will lead to a **Treasure Chest** that's guarded by a Yaksha Archer on a high ledge, and a Red-Haired Yaksha in front of the chest. 

These guys are in a league of their own, and you may even want to wait until your max health is restored if you're currently under the effect of the beguiling chant's curse, as this enemy can kill you extremely quickly. Using their large forearm blade, the Red-Haired Yaksha can employ many strong martial arts attacks, including a sweeping lunge to close the distance in a hurry. 

![Wukong Pagoda 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/81/Wukong_Pagoda_28.jpg)

He can also fire off three projectiles after a retreating jump, and then follow up with a running kick to stagger you, before assaulting you with a series of sweeping strikes. Especially deadly is a series of two palm strikes with the smaller end of his forearm blade, followed quickly by a backwards jumping bicycle kick that can hit extremely hard without warning. 

![Wukong Pagoda 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/60/Wukong_Pagoda_27.jpg)

It's not a bad idea to throw off an Immobilize or Cloud Step to bypass the main fighter, and then run to perform a leaping heavy strike to reach the archer and get him out of the way first. 

Once both combatants are dead, be sure to loot the chest, and head back into the cell tunnel, and upwards to level 3. 

![Wukong Pagoda 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c0/Wukong_Pagoda_29.jpg)

A word of warning: You'll soon spot the telltale trail of gold that means the next Shrine is close at hand, but to reach it, you'll need to pass through one last tunnel section guarded by another Red-Haired Yaksha. If the last encounter proved difficult, you may want to Immobilize or Cloud Step and run past him to get the Shrine, rather than risk having to come all this way again. 

![Wukong Pagoda 30X.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/96/Wukong_Pagoda_30X.jpg)

As you reach the Upper Pagoda Shrine, you might notice a large pit nearby in the cell tunnel, with a familiar purple glow coming from below. You're right above where you crossed the wooden beam, meaning the strange chamber you saw through the window is also right below you, and it houses a very important but optional Yaoguai Chief. Defeating him will be the key to unlocking the purple seals you've spotted all over this realm, but it's also worth pointing out that until you defeat the Yaoguai King of this area, you'll have to defeat this optional boss with the chanting curse sapping half your health at any point. 

![Wukong Pagoda 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/04/Wukong_Pagoda_31.jpg)

If you're up for the challenge, carefully drop down onto a rooftop in the pit below to avoid taking fall damage, then jump onto rocky rubble below to face this foe. 

### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Captain Lotus-Vision

One of four Captains of the Pagoda Realm, Captain Lotus-Vision is responsible for sealing many of the prison cells, and must be defeated before you can unlock them. He is a strange Yaoguai Chief, and doesn't really have any melee attacks to speak of, instead opting for a series of projectiles and lasers to attack you with. With that in mind, it's highly recommended that you equip the Cloud Step Spell over Rock Solid for help evading some of his attacks. 

![Wukong Pagoda 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/24/Wukong_Pagoda_32.jpg)

You'll find find Captain Lotus-Vision in front of a large group of kneeling corpses, which he can randomly imbue with magic to create a Withered Corpse that will come to life and attack you. These are nothing more than a distraction, but should still be dealt with immediately so they don't hamstring you later. 

Luckily, he'll get rid of all the corpses later in the fight, and they won't respawn for future attempts. 

Much of this boss's power comes from a purple crystal mounted on the tip of a staff he carries against his shoulder, which will expend a variety of projectile attacks. Some will be easier to anticipate than others, but you'll always want to keep that crystal in view. 

![Wukong Pagoda 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/47/Wukong_Pagoda_34.jpg)

Early on, basic attacks will include a large circle of projectiles that expel from the crystal before arcing toward you. Other times, it will expel a trio of projectiles in three short bursts before they track you down in waves. 

![Wukong Pagoda 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f1/Wukong_Pagoda_35.jpg)

For each of these attacks, be ready with your Staff-Spin counter, and consider investing in skills to keep this move going and to attack out of it once you've deflected all the projectiles heading your way. A lot of this fight will come down to finding the right opportunities to strike after surviving his attacks, and you'll need all the boosts you can get. 

Other times, he may trigger a bunch of explosions on the floor, which only give you a moment's notice to dodge them, so stay mobile and roll around for a better chance of not getting hit. 

![Wukong Pagoda 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/32/Wukong_Pagoda_33.jpg)

Things will get more difficult any time you see the crystal on his staff flare brighter. These brief flashes indicate a laser beam blast that you'll only have a moment to dodge or take considerable damage, and you'll have to deal with even more as time goes on. Early on, watch for a laser to shoot out as he creates projectiles rings before you start spinning your staff. 

![Wukong Pagoda 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5a/Wukong_Pagoda_36.jpg)

Once you take out around a third of his health, he'll teleport back near his original position, and shatter the remaining corpses as he draws power, creating a large and intricate circle of runic power behind him. 

Things will get extremely dangerous and annoying at this point, as he'll not only unleash a constant beam from his crystal, but the ring behind him will form smaller rings to blast you from four different locations. This will result in dodging on top of dodging as you have to escape the constant laser, and also four different blasts, and a final blast from all four circles at once. 

![Wukong Pagoda 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b1/Wukong_Pagoda_37.jpg)

Because of the difficulty of this section (and that you may also be at half health from the chanting curse), we highly recommend using Cloud Step so at your decoy can draw fire for a large portion of this attack. 

After the four circles all emit their laser blasts, they'll float away from Captain Lotus-Vision to take up spots in each corner of the room. Each circle will emit a continuous laser that borders the room, and will slowly pan them around to cross over the floor and each other. 

![Wukong Pagoda 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f3/Wukong_Pagoda_38.jpg)

Dodging them will be extremely difficult, so instead swap to your Pillar Stance and extend off the floor (preferably in range of the Captain) and start charging up as you evade the floor lasers. Once they perform a second sweep, launch your attack the captain. 

![Wukong Pagoda 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/46/Wukong_Pagoda_40.jpg)

In this second phase, the rings in each corner will stay largely dormant, but can still activate with a flash to shoot a laser at you, which you'll need to dodge alongside the laser from his crystal. Luckily they seem to all shoot at once, so you only need to keep one ring in view when continuing the fight. 

![Wukong Pagoda 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8c/Wukong_Pagoda_39.jpg)

In addition to his usual attacks, he'll also start teleporting more aggressively, sending out a new laser beam as he appears at his new location up to three times -- ending with an extended laser beam for several seconds. Several smaller projectiles can also be expelled into the air as he teleports, which will slowly trail after you to deal minor damage if they catch up. 

He can also start detonating a trail of explosions that follow you along the ground, but have a bigger indicator than the randomly placed explosions so you can outpace them by sprinting around and dodging. 

![Wukong Pagoda 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e6/Wukong_Pagoda_41.jpg)

One of the more confusing attacks can happen when he floats up higher into the air, prompting the rings in each corner to send beams straight up in the air. beams will then start appearing at random angles in the ceiling to strike the floor in more and more locations, limiting your movement. Stay mobile and look for spots to safely stand as lasers fire off around you - and if you're still in range, hit the Captain with the Pillar Stance smash. 

![Wukong Pagoda 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/34/Wukong_Pagoda_42.jpg)

Keep building up your Focus with light combos by chasing him down and using Immobilize to keep him from teleporting away, and use any lulls in his projectile attacks to rack up damage, and then unleash a charged pillar or thrust attack before he can escape. 

![Wukong Pagoda 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Wukong_Pagoda_43.jpg)

When Captain Lotus-Vision finally falls, you'll gain the **Frostsprout Twig Curio** , and **The Spirit of Captain Lotus-Vision** , which surprisingly cannot be cultivated like other Spirits. 

Captain Lotus-Vision

More importantly, the purple seals on many of the cell doors are now gone in the Pagoda Realm, allowing you to kick them down and access a few secrets. There's some we haven't encountered in the Upper Pagoda, but be sure to go back and check these cells: 

![Wukong Pagoda 44.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d5/Wukong_Pagoda_44.jpg)

  * Level 1 - Right next to where you entered the realm, you can open the door to speak face to face with the Prisoner. He mentions Lotus-Vision was one of his four Captains, and that Yellowbrow tricked him and imprisoned him here, taking control of his Captains in the process. He'll request that you kill them all to ease their suffering. You can also pull the sword out of the dead two-headed Rat Captain and gain the Ashen Slumber Transformation Spell, letting you turn into a Rat Captain yourself and inflict fire, building up focus to transfer back to your main form.

![Wukong Pagoda 45.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3d/Wukong_Pagoda_45.jpg)

  * Level 1 - On the path from the first locked cell to the Lower Pagoda Shrine, another locked cell holds a Bandit Chief (like the one you encountered in the Forest of Wolves) that guards a **Treasure Chest** of materials.

![Wukong Pagoda 46.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5d/Wukong_Pagoda_46.jpg)

  * Level 2 - Technically the door is back on level 1, but to reach it you'll need to climb the stairs to level 2 and left to find a pit leading back down to the first floor. Here you'll find a cell you can now open, and inside is a Red-Haired Yaksha guarding a **Treasure Chest** with a Mind Core and materials.

![Wukong Pagoda 48.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/db/Wukong_Pagoda_48.jpg)

  * Level 2 - On the path to the right after climbing the stairs, look for the first cell door on the right guarded by a Cyan Bat. Inside is an Abomination in the corner, as well as an empowered Enslaved Yaksha you can defeat to gain the Enslaved Yaksha Spirit. Defeat them both and help yourself to a **Treasure Chest** in the corner full of materials.

## Upper Pagoda (Level 3)

From the Upper Pagoda Shrine, your journey to the top will continue. A singular path will lie on the outdoor ring that you can progress across. 

![Wukong Pagoda 49.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8e/Wukong_Pagoda_49.jpg)

If you defeated Captain Lotus-Vision, the first locked cell you encounter on the left will now be unlocked, allowing you to open and loot the **Treasure Chest** within for various materials. Just beware of a much larger Swift Bat hiding above the chest. 

![Wukong Pagoda 53.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/01/Wukong_Pagoda_53.jpg)

Up ahead, watch out for an ambushing Frozen Corpse before you reach another long wooden plank that you'll need to cross. You may also run into another Lantern Sentry on this section of the walkway, so be sure to take him out as well. 

![Wukong Pagoda 51.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/43/Wukong_Pagoda_51.jpg)

This plank will be even harder to cross than the first, as you'll have to not only deal with a Yaksha Archer on a small platform halfway across, but a second archer in an open cell window on the left, and another near the end of the wooden plank. Worse still -- there's a Cyan Bat hiding above the archer halfway across the plank who will divebomb you if you attempt to fight that archer, and likely send you toppling down to the level below to die from fall damage. 

If you survive the fall, make sure to use the Incense Trail Talisman to quickly warp back to the Shrine instead of having to make the climb yet again. 

There are a few strategies to try if you're having trouble here. Since trying to move while staff-spinning will just send you over the edge, you should instead try to use Cloud Step to evade their arrows and try to kill the archer on the platform quickly (he won't respawn) and then run from the Cyan Bat. 

![Wukong Pagoda 55.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/86/Wukong_Pagoda_55.jpg)

You can also try launching yourself to the archer in the window, by jumping and using a midair heavy attack to give yourself a boost over to the window... but do note that he's not alone. 

![Wukong Pagoda 56.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/60/Wukong_Pagoda_56.jpg)

However you get across, you can find an entrance into the cell tunnel leading to where the archer was stationed, and encounter a Red-Haired Yaksha guarding a green Wisp to absorb, which is helpful for getting back some of your healing gourd after the fight. 

![Wukong Pagoda 57.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5d/Wukong_Pagoda_57.jpg)

Further up the cell tunnel, you may notice a Snake-Head Mushroom glowing blue... that can't be right. Try to harvest it, and you'll uncover an extremely strong Fungiman enemy. 

![Wukong Pagoda 59.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/80/Wukong_Pagoda_59.jpg)

He's much stronger than any plant Guai you've encountered, and summons poison pools all around him. He can also shoot out several poison projectiles at you from all sides, and stab the ground repeatedly to cause poison explosions. 

![Wukong Pagoda 58.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0c/Wukong_Pagoda_58.jpg)

Watch out for his extended spinning attack with his weapon, and wait for him to get dizzy before launching a counter attack and Immobilizing him to extend his downtime. If he floats into the air, be ready for him to crash his weapon into the ground as he lands. 

When defeated, you'll earn his Fungiman Spirit to add to your collection. Not far past where the Fungiman was hiding you can spot the stairway up to Level 4, but there's a bit more to explore here first. 

![Wukong Pagoda 60.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d1/Wukong_Pagoda_60.jpg)

Back on the outside ring, you may notice two more Lantern Sentries patrolling when the beguiling chant is active, so it's a good idea to take them down whenever the chanting begins. 

![Wukong Pagoda 61.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f6/Wukong_Pagoda_61.jpg)

If you keep heading past the two sentries, you'll find a few more open cells that have Snake-Head Mushrooms and a glowing green Wisp to absorb. The third cell has a purple seal on it -- unless you already defeated the Yaoguai Chief Captain -- in which case you can open it to grab a second green Wisp guarded by a Withered Corpse. 

![Wukong Pagoda 64.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e0/Wukong_Pagoda_64.jpg)

At the far end of this path past another open cell with a green Wisp, the walkway will have crumbled before you can reach the last green Wisp, but there's a side passage into an open cell. (a Lantern Sentry will also appear walking out of this cell when the chanting is active!) 

![Wukong Pagoda 62.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b9/Wukong_Pagoda_62.jpg)

The cell beyond will require you to have beaten Captain Lotus-Vision to unlock, and holds a **Treasure Chest** with materials in addition to the Wisp on the ledge, guarded by another Red-Haired Yaksha. 

## Upper Pagoda (Level 4)

![Wukong Pagoda 63.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8b/Wukong_Pagoda_63.jpg)

Once you reach the fourth level, the escape from this hell is closer than ever, but there's still one last stretch to cover. 

![Wukong Pagoda 65.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e5/Wukong_Pagoda_65.jpg)

Head outside the cells slowly, and you can poke a Blade Monk on the outside off the ledge he's standing on the edge of. 

![Wukong Pagoda 66.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1e/Wukong_Pagoda_66.jpg)

Then head to the cell on the right to find another Blade Monk guarding a **Treasure Chest** full of random materials. There's also a green Wisp just outside on the ledge. 

![Wukong Pagoda 67.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d6/Wukong_Pagoda_67.jpg)

Stepping outside, you can see a long path down the left leading up and out of the prison at the far end, but walking the path is another tough Red-Haired Yaksha to deal with first. 

Be wary of ambushes from Frozen Corpses that will try to hamper your battles with the Red-Haired Yaksha, and engage them cautiously when you feel like you have the upper hand. Once he's out of the way, grab the green Wisp and then head up the broken wooden ramp. 

![Wukong Pagoda 68.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/de/Wukong_Pagoda_68.jpg)

After you defeat the lone archer guarding the ramp up out of the prison, you may notice any current curse applied to you will dissipate the moment you reach the top! You can celebrate this breath of fresh air, just be wary of a Frozen Corpse waiting to try and attack you as you cross the last wooden beam. 

![Wukong Pagoda 69.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f9/Wukong_Pagoda_69.jpg)

To the left, you can find the Mani Wheel Shrine and a path to the boss, but there's one last section of the fourth level of the prison we need to complete, which unfortunately means going back to the madness. Be sure to unlock the Shrine regardless so you can teleport back to it easily. 

Take the path going right from the wooden beams, and you'll come upon a group of frozen corpses by a raised platform. They'll be smashed to pieces as a new enemy flies down -- a Falcon Fan-Maker. 

![Wukong Pagoda 70.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/04/Wukong_Pagoda_70.jpg)

This enemy is built fairly tough, and can launch themselves high up to slice the air with their fan to create projectiles to slash your way. 

When he descends back to the ground, use Immobilize to keep him pinned down as you press the attack, and use Spirit attacks to keep him staggered. Be ready for him to flap his wings to push your back or create whirlwinds as he flies up. 

The Falcon man can also use a slow two-handed overhand swing in melee range, or at a distance to create giant tornadoes hurtling your way. 

![Wukong Pagoda 71.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e7/Wukong_Pagoda_71.jpg)

His most dangerous attack is a repeated spinning divebomb attack he can perform repeatedly to dash at you from all angles. Once you get the timing down, a Rock Solid deflection can stop him cold, or you can Cloud Step to the side and retaliate as he flies past. 

![Wukong Pagoda 72.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6d/Wukong_Pagoda_72.jpg)

Once defeated, look to the right past where he appeared to find a broken walkway with several rock platforms you can carefully drop down to find the other side of the pagoda's Level 4 walkway. 

![Wukong Pagoda 73.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/45/Wukong_Pagoda_73.jpg)

Head up the path where you'll find one more Red-Haired Yaksha patrolling, and lure him away from the enemies at the end of the path to take him on alone. 

![Wukong Pagoda 74.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c5/Wukong_Pagoda_74.jpg)

Past where the Yaksha was patrolling, you should find two cells. One is already open, and holds a green Wisp inside near a Frozen Corpse keep traveling down this cell tunnel past an Abomination, and you can find a **Treasure Chest** with some materials inside. 

![Wukong Pagoda 75.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a0/Wukong_Pagoda_75.jpg)

Next door, you can find the final sealed cell, which you can now open if you defeated Captain Lotus-Vision. Inside is another **Treasure Chest** that has more random materials, but it's guarded by an Enslaved Yaksha. 

Past that last cell door, there's a big open area with a few final important things to do: 

![Wukong Pagoda 76.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ac/Wukong_Pagoda_76.jpg)

First, look for a Blade Monk surrounded by frozen corpses, and note his blue glow. He's a lot more durable than the others, but by taking him on patiently and using your cooldowns, you'll be able to defeat him and gain the **Blade Monk Spirit**. 

Just past where the was stationed, you can spot a glowing pot in the corner. Break it open to gain a new **Awaken Wine Worm** , and be sure to travel back to the Shen Monkey to upgrade your Gourd (and make sure you grabbed the new items he sells!). 

Outside the Pagona Awaken Wine Worm

![Wukong Pagoda 77.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ad/Wukong_Pagoda_77.jpg)

Finally, wait until the distressing chants begin and curse you one last time, and a final Lantern Sentry on this level will appear nearby. If you defeat him (and have defeated all the other Lantern Sentries in the Pagoda Realm), he'll drop the **Auspicious Lantern Curio** , which allows you to trigger the "chant-beguiling" effect of this prison at will when using Cloud Step. 

## Mani Wheel

As you head back to the shrine before the next big boss fight, now is a good time to take stock on what you've gained thus far. 

  * Be sure to spend all your will by cultivating chosen spirits, and crafting a strong weapon, either the Loongwreathe Staff if you've defeated both the Red Loong and Black Loong in Chapter 1 and 2, or the Kang-Jin Staff which can deal electric damage if you have the right skils unlocked for Punishing Downpour.
  * Travel back to the Shen Monkey and upgrade your Gourd's healing capabilities, and stock up on whatever new items he's selling.
  * Make sure to keep Cloud Step equipped over Rock Solid, as it'll be equally worthwhile for this boss as it was for the last.

When you're ready, it's time to stop that awful chanting once and for all by heading into the pagoda itself. 

## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Captain Wise-Voice

![Wukong Pagoda 78.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/ba/Wukong_Pagoda_78.jpg)

Much like Captain Lotus-Vision, the second Captain of the Pagoda Realm is a creepy one, with a strange construct-like shape with four legs, housing an golden sphere adorned with dragons that serves as its central core. The rest of the construct is highly resistant to damage, meaning you'll need to stun it so that you can take a shot at its most vulnerable part. 

Only one of its legs is susceptible to attack, where you can see an orange glow emanating from its front right leg, so try to focus your attacks there whenever possible to try and stagger it. 

![Wukong Pagoda 79.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3c/Wukong_Pagoda_79.jpg)

Captain Wise-Voice has a lot of unorthodox attacks, made by violently spinning its golden sphere of a head around to emit thin beams of light. If you start to see beams erupt in different directions, start strafing to get distance, and prepare to dodge or sprint away when all the beams finally flash down in your direction at the same time. 

![Wukong Pagoda 83.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/51/Wukong_Pagoda_83.jpg)

After a short delay, he'll perform another blast as the laser cuts upward, requiring a second dodge. 

Other times, it will create a sustained laser much faster, roving around you to slash upwards, and then create a trail of lightning strikes in a vertical line you'll need to quickly strafe to outpace. 

![Wukong Pagoda 80.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fd/Wukong_Pagoda_80.jpg)

It can also generate electrical power in its front leg, and stomp down to create a ring that extends outward, requiring you to dodge over it or use the Pillar Stance to evade it entirely. 

![Wukong Pagoda 85.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/91/Wukong_Pagoda_85.jpg)

Other times, it will perform a series of slow stomps, causing multiple electric spots to appear around you. You'll need to sprint away from these spots before a delayed lightning blast can strike the ground where you are. 

![Wukong Pagoda 82.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5f/Wukong_Pagoda_82.jpg)

Captain Wise-Voice also has a number of up close melee stomps, smashes, and kicks you'll need to be wary of when attacking the hoof, which can be hard to anticipate with the camera angle. Whenever you see it start to move erratically, that's your cue to back up and be ready to evade. 

![Wukong Pagoda 84.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2f/Wukong_Pagoda_84.jpg)

Certain times, it can even perform a charging attack by moving its head down, but you can lure it into charging the wall and dazing itself, letting you score a bunch of free hits. 

![Wukong Pagoda 81.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1d/Wukong_Pagoda_81.jpg)

After taking a bit of damage, the boss will charge up to emit its "beguiling chant", blurring your vision somewhat, and performing an effect similar to when you were ascending the prison. Thankfully this will only lower your maximum health by around a fourth, and still give you a damage boost in return. The effect doesn't last forever -- only for around a full minute -- so make the most of it! 

![Wukong Pagoda 86.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/67/Wukong_Pagoda_86.jpg)

Once enough damage has been sustained to its leg, you'll see its leg start to explode with light, meaning your attacks have successfully staggered the boss. He'll fall to the ground in a heap, with its sphere-like core right in front of you. 

![Wukong Pagoda 87.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7a/Wukong_Pagoda_87.jpg)

This is your best chance to get in some real damage, but it's worth noting that a big charged heavy strike can sometimes knock it completely out of its dazed state. Instead, build up some more focus with one or two light combos, and then expend all your focus points on a bit charged hit to end its daze, taking off a huge amount of health in the process. 

Repeat the process of damaging its leg, or look for any opportunities to strike at its head -- particularly when it triggers the beguiling chant again to take off a chunk of your maximum HP. 

However, you'll also need to be ready to deal with its one major attack, which usually comes after you've assaulted its sphere at least once. 

At a certain point, the construct will step into a corner of the room while the sphere lifts up and float high up toward the center, spinning wildly. It will send out beams of electricity in all direction as it twirls around, and the music swells. 

![Wukong Pagoda 88.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bb/Wukong_Pagoda_88.jpg)

Keep strafing, and wait for lasers to start hitting the ground near you to trigger incoming lightning strikes on your position. This is a great time to use Cloud Step to give it the slip, allowing you to conserve stamina for the final act. 

Eventually, you'll see the entire floor light up with criss-crossing lines over almost every inch of the surface. Keep dodging the lightning strikes, and as soon as the floor glows red, hop onto your Pillar Stance to extend off the ground (the more stamina you have built up, the better). 

![Wukong Pagoda 89.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/60/Wukong_Pagoda_89.jpg)

With a massive blast, the ground will explode in color, dealing a ton of damage if you aren't grounded at the top of your staff, and then the sphere will return to the construct body. 

![Wukong Pagoda 90.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6b/Wukong_Pagoda_90.jpg)

To defeat him, stay patient by building up focus points with sustained damage on his leg, using your Spirit Attacks too to rack up damage so that it can stagger the boss, then unleash more combos before your biggest charged up strike to maximize damage to his weak point before he rises. Use Cloud Step to get away from some of his more pesky lighting strikes and beams, and use Immobilize to stop Lotus-Vision's wild melee stomps and attacks (it generally doesn't work to help extend his stunned state). 

![Wukong Pagoda 91.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/82/Wukong_Pagoda_91.jpg)

When Captain Wise-Voice finally falls to your assault, the Pagoda Realm will at last be free of his beguiling chant. This means you can head down to re-explore if you missed any areas without worrying about the debuff (but it also means any Sentry Lanterns not killed are gone forever). 

Captain Wise-Voice

![Wukong Pagoda 92.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/35/Wukong_Pagoda_92.jpg)

Like Captain Lotus-Vision, you'll also get The Spirit of Captain Wise-Voice that can't be cultivated. You can now step out through the opposite opening to exit this pagoda, and you can check the rim of the cliff to the left to find a **Treasure Chest** with materials inside. 

## Outside the Wheel

Your journey through the Pagoda Realm isn't done yet however, as there's a large linear mountain pass with a few branching paths to explore as you exit this particular area. 

![Wukong Pagoda 93.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/90/Wukong_Pagoda_93.jpg)

From the Outside the Wheel Shrine, head through the large cave tunnel devoid of foes where you can harvest some Jade Lotus. Over on the left, look for a lone tree in the cave pool to find a **Luojia Fragrant Vine** to grab, and be sure to revisit the Shen Monkey to upgrade your gourd. 

Outside the Wheel Luojia Fragrant Vine

As you exit the cave, you'll find yourself at the bottom of a gorge with more plants to harvest as you proceed. 

![Wukong Pagoda 95.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Wukong_Pagoda_95.jpg)

Absorb the green Wisp in a small tunnel you can pass through, and on the other side you'll see a few stone lanterns marking an area with a small gold pot. Open it, and you'll find a **Celestial Taiyi Pill** inside to boost your maximum mana. 

The New West Celestial Taiyi Pill

![Wukong Pagoda 96.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/47/Wukong_Pagoda_96.jpg)

Before continuing along the main path, break open the wooden fence behind the pill containers, and you'll find an alternate path. 

![Wukong Pagoda 97.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/87/Wukong_Pagoda_97.jpg)

This will lead to the bottom of a giant frozen waterfall, and guarding it is a strange type of Abomination enemy. This foe sports two tentacle-like appendages growing over his shoulder that he can use to attack with, alternating lashes with both sides before bringing them both upward. 

He can also spin in place while using his appendages to grab a snow-covered rock out of the ground, using his momentum to slam it down on you for a startling amount of damage, requiring you to dodge quickly to avoid taking damage. 

![Wukong Pagoda 98.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e9/Wukong_Pagoda_98.jpg)

He can also lure you in and open his robe, revealing even more tentacles along his chest to strike you with, so attack cautiously, and don't be afraid to go all in with your spells and Spirit Attacks to keep him staggered. 

![Wukong Pagoda 99.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/49/Wukong_Pagoda_99.jpg)

After defeating this abomination, you can find a **Meditation Spot** by a small tree at the base of the frozen falls, earning you a free Spark Skill Point. 

The Bottom, Pagoda Realm Meditation Spot

![Wukong Pagoda 100.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7a/Wukong_Pagoda_100.jpg)

Back on the main path, be wary of Frozen Corpses that you'll find littered around this area. As the gorge path opens up, you can spy an even bigger pagoda than the one you just escape from high up above you. 

Head through this area either taking the low path to the left, or check the upper path on the right where many Frozen Corpses have gathered around a Tree Pearl you can harvest. 

![Wukong Pagoda 101.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8b/Wukong_Pagoda_101.jpg)

The lower left path leads to another tentacle abomination you'll have to deal with carefully to avoid his lashing an boulder slam, and then head into a tunnel on the right. 

![Wukong Pagoda 102.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9f/Wukong_Pagoda_102.jpg)

Clear out the Frozen Corpses in the small tunnel leading into another narrow gorge guarded by a Yaksha Patroller. 

![Wukong Pagoda 103.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/87/Wukong_Pagoda_103.jpg)

Just past him, you'll find a long stone staircase to ascend and chase the golden trail of a nearby Shrine. Grab the green Wisp as you make the climb, and at the end you'll find the next checkpoint. 

## Snow-Veiled Trail

The next area is a bit deceptive in its multiple paths when in reality the rest of the Pagoda Realm is fairly linear (and even quick) should you be interested in progressing as soon as possible. 

The main path leads up a slope to the left of the Shrine, and then to a large rock-filled forested area further left that you can ignore if you keep on the main path up to the Warding Temple where the last boss of this area is. 

However, you can first explore a second short area off to the right from the Shrine leading downhill. 

![Wukong Pagoda 104.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/73/Wukong_Pagoda_104.jpg)

Crossing a short rope bridge high above the gorge you came in through, you'll reach a large rocky snowfield with low visibility due to snowy winds. Many Frozen Corpses are scattered around this area can be tough to pick out as you advance, so move cautiously. 

![Wukong Pagoda 105.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4e/Wukong_Pagoda_105.jpg)

Be sure to check the right corner first to find Tree Pearls to harvest, and a floating green Wisp in the left corner to absorb. 

Making your way up the snowfield, the winds will die down as the giant titular pagoda of this realm appears to loom up in front of you. This may seem like the main path to advance, but in reality it's more of a teaser. 

![Wukong Pagoda 106.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e7/Wukong_Pagoda_106.jpg)

You'll find a large empty field up the slope, leading to a shrouded gate of fog that lets you enter The Great Pagoda. Inside, you can activate a Shrine, but you'll find there's no one in this grand room. 

![Wukong Pagoda 107.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b3/Wukong_Pagoda_107.jpg)

What you will find are two large murals on the first two walls on the left, and looking closely you should be able to recognize them -- they are the scenes depicted to you after completing the previous chapters! With that in mind, you'll want to come back here after getting close to completing the game, once all the scenes have been unlocked in this room, but for now, head back to the Snow-Veiled Trail Shrine. 

![Wukong Pagoda 108.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/24/Wukong_Pagoda_108.jpg)

Head up the slope full of Frozen Corpses to the large forested area full of rocks. A golden trail will soon appear leading straight ahead and up a broken stairway to the Warding Temple on the hill, but there's an optional area to consider first off to the left. 

![Wukong Pagoda 109.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/51/Wukong_Pagoda_109.jpg)

Exploring this large rock-filled forest, you'll find a lot of Frozen Corpses that will come to lift, and more than a few plants to harvest as well. 

![Wukong Pagoda 110.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5f/Wukong_Pagoda_110.jpg)

The further back you get, the more enemies you'll encounter, including a strange new aggressive plant that can spin in place or shoot poison projectiles at you. Defeat this Golden Lotus Guai for a good chance to earn a Golden Lotus. You can also encounter a lone Yaksha Patroller in the middle of the field. 

![Wukong Pagoda 111.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f9/Wukong_Pagoda_111.jpg)

As you head up the right side of this field just past where the Yaksha Patroller was, be ready for another Falcon enemy to swoop down between two small gnarled trees. Like the one at the top of the Mani Wheel, he'll attack at range with projectile slices, divebomb you with forward spins, or create tornado gusts to keep you at bay. 

![Wukong Pagoda 112.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f7/Wukong_Pagoda_112.jpg)

Another Falcon Guai will appear not far up on the left side between two much larger trees, but apart from these enemies the rest of this sloping forest is largely devoid of enemies. Be sure to check behind the trees where he appeared to absorb another green Wisp. 

You can find a path continuing at the top of the slope off to the right, past another Golden Lotus Guai. 

![Wukong Pagoda 113.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/08/Wukong_Pagoda_113.jpg)

When the path turns into a large valley, another Falcon Guai will appear, only this one is empowered by the Spirit within. You'll need to attack cautiously against this stronger foe, using Spirit attacks to stagger him, and Cloud Step to sidestep his gusts to flank him from the sides. Defeat him, and you'll gain the Falcon Hermit Spirit. 

![Wukong Pagoda 114.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/94/Wukong_Pagoda_114.jpg)

Head through the rest of the valley and deal with a Yaksha Patroller, which will lead to another rope bridge leading to a higher ledge. 

![Wukong Pagoda 115.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/23/Wukong_Pagoda_115.jpg)

Up ahead, you'll find a large stone obelisk with a **Treasure Chest** at its base, which is unfortunately guarded by another strong Abomination with its twin tentacle appendages. Time your attack carefully to avoid its high damage strikes, and then loot the chest to gain some valuable items, which should include a Knot of Voidness and Blood of the Iron Bull.

The rest of the path leads right back along a ridge that overlooks the forest you ventured through earlier (as well as some Celestial Pears you can harvest), and eventually over to the side of the Warding Temple that you can drop down to reach the Shrine. 

![Wukong Pagoda 117.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6e/Wukong_Pagoda_117.jpg)

Before you head in, be sure to explore the bottom of the stairway for a small narrow path beyond. Check to the left of a small tunnel to find another Abomination guarding a **Treasure Chest** with materials, then head through (watching out for a Cyan Bat lurking above) to reach a dead end cliff overlooking the Grand Pagoda in the distance, and check the left side of the cliff to grab a green Wisp guarded by a Frozen Corpse. 

## Warding Temple

![Wukong Pagoda 119.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/94/Wukong_Pagoda_119.jpg)

When you're ready and all rested up, head up into the Temple to follow the sounds of someone fighting. What you'll encounter inside seems to be a pretty one-sided fight, as the Macaque Chief you battled previously is trying in vain to get at the Wise Master you upgraded your Gourd. The Macaque seems unable to reach the man through the ring of fire that's been erected, so it'll be your job to teach this boss another lesson. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Macaque Chief (Second Encounter)

The good news is the Macaque Chief doesn't have many more surprises for you since the last fight -- even less since he won't bother trying to fake begging for mercy this time around. You'll also be much stronger since the last time you met, so this fight may not even take a long. 

![Wukong Pagoda 120.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/41/Wukong_Pagoda_120.jpg)

If it's been awhile since you fought him last, remember that his one major attack will have him jump into the air and slam his blade into the ground, and then perform series of quick claw swipes in front of him with surprising reach, all while keeping close to the blade behind him -- meaning he can't really pivot if you dodge and attack from the sides. 

He'll step back to grab the sword with his foot and jump onto its hilt, before preforming a quick roll along the ground to drag the sword in a whirlwind slice with a large reach to it, followed by a final downward slam, so don't press your attack too hard during this combo, or Immobilize him before the second part of his combo.

A longer deadly combo attack he can employ comes with three quick slashes ending in a jumping upward slash. After a brief pause in the air, he'll use his foot to send the blade slamming down vertically, and then yank it back up in an arc for a final two-hand diagonal slice attack. Your Rock Solid won't always stagger him mid-combo, so it's better to wait and parry the final slice so you can retaliate faster. 

![Wukong Pagoda 122.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9e/Wukong_Pagoda_122.jpg)

If he begins to hold the blade in both hands, prepare for an extended attack with three alternating slices ending in an upward swing with a long delay. When he finally brings the blade down, he'll do so in a spinning multi-hit slash, followed by a final slam to emit a projectile slash. 

![Wukong Pagoda 123.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/df/Wukong_Pagoda_123.jpg)

As an added bonus for this fight, you can actually use the Ancient Master's circle of fire to your own advantage, as the Macaque Chief can't move through it. If you ever see him preparing for a big series of slashes or need to get away and heal simply move to the opposite side of the circle, and his attacks won't reach you. 

![Wukong Pagoda 124.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/33/Wukong_Pagoda_124.jpg)

When you've depleted the Macaque Chief's health yet again, he'll retreat for a second time, but the Wise Master will ask that you hold off your pursuit. In exchange for staying put for a bit, he will impart to you the secret of his **Ring of Fire Spell**! 

Macaque Chief (Warding Temple)

This spell can be swapped out with Immobilize, providing a more defensive variant on temporarily neutralizing enemies. With it, you'll be able to create a small limited barrier for yourself, which can be essential when preparing for a tough fight and using consumables and heals, or removing chilling effects. 

![Wukong Pagoda 125.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/70/Wukong_Pagoda_125.jpg)

Head around the side of the temple after the Wise Master departs, and you can find a **Treasure Chest** around the side of the temple holding some materials. 

![Wukong Pagoda 126.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1b/Wukong_Pagoda_126.jpg)

Head up the stairs to the left and head through the hall lined with more Frozen Corpses to leave this area behind. At the top of the nearby hill, you can spot a large cymbal wedged in the rocks of a high peak overlooking a lake below. By sliding down the slope, you'll enter the new region along the **Bitter Lake**, and slide headfirst into a formidable boss fight!
