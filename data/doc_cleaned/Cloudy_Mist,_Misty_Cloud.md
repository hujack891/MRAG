# Cloudy Mist, Misty Cloud

Cloudy Mist, Misty Cloud are a pair of Yaoguai Chiefs you'll fight before you reach The Emerald Hall in Chapter 5 in Black Myth: Wukong. This is the second duo of chiefs you'll fight in Chapter 5 and they'll try a number of tricks to disappear right before your eyes. 

## How to Find Cloudy Mist, Misty Cloud

Continue up the path, past where you'll fight the Flint Chief. At the top, you'll reach a crossroads, where you can go left, or right. Take the path up to the right and at the top, you'll come to another archway and the start of Rakshasa Palace.

As soon as you pass through the archway, the next boss battle will begin and you'll discover who was responsible for the voices you heard earlier.

Cloudy Mist and Misty Cloud are another duo that will use different elements to fight you. You'll go up against Cloudy Mist first, who is the creature with the staff.

It will mainly shoot lasers from the smaller face on its chest and use projectiles. The way that these attacks appear can vary wildly from one laser at a time, to multiple in a criss-cross pattern. As for the projectiles, you'll see either a few larger balls of mist or multiple tiny ones sent your way.

The lasers can be avoided by dodging or jumping over them, and the projectiles can be outrun or you can dodge to stop them hitting you. When there are numerous, we'd recommend outrunning them, and when there are just a few, dodge out of the way. During this fight, you want to stay as close to Cloudy Mist as possible, to remove the advantage of his long-range attacks.

Misty Cloud will soon appear, though he will look almost see-through initially. He will often pop up as soon as Cloudy Mist has finished a set of moves, hoping to catch you off guard and hit you with his flaming bundle. 

The key to keeping track of this creature is to see where the cloud moves and jump out of the way when it gets close to you. Misty Cloud favors the use of a flaming bundle, operating it like a hammer and delivering fire attacks.

As Cloudy Mist is the first to appear, this should be where you first attack. Things will change when you manage to hit Cloudy Mist enough times that it will send out a bright light as a flashbang that can stun both you and Misty Cloud. For a brief moment, Misty Cloud won't be able to see you and Cloudy Mist will become its eyes.

When this happens, you'll want to focus on dodging the fire attacks from Misty Cloud. These often happen with him dragging the flaming bundle along the floor, to try and create a ripple of flames to get you. Or slamming it down like a hammer. There will be times when he puts the bundle on his back, and he's slow with this move, so you've got plenty of time to attack.

The fight can feel quite fast-paced as they swap in and out to attack, so to put an end to their teamwork and slow things down, make use of spells like Immobilize. You should then aim to build as much Focus as possible and look for opportunities to perform heavy attacks. Both bosses can be staggered by this, giving you a chance to whittle down their health.

After defeating them collect the Spirit they drop, then continue up the stairs toward the palace.
