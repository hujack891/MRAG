# Frostsprout Twig

The Frostsprout Twig Curios item in Black Myth: Wukong can be found within Chapter 3 of the game. While well-hidden, you will want to pick this up as it is locked behind a secret boss that will open additional areas in the Pagoda Realm. 

With the Frostsprout Twig equipped, your Chill resistance is moderately increased, which is incredibly useful in The New West, especially in the locations after you find this Curios item.

As with all other Curios' in Black Myth: Wukong, the Frosprout Twig can't be upgraded, so you can't increase its power or potency. Therefore, you will want to switch to other Curios items to better fit your build as you play via the Equipment menu. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Frostsprout Twig Location

The Frostsprout Twig can be obtained by defeating Captain Lotus-Vision in the Pagoda Realm within The New West. From the Upper Pagoda Shrine, jump down in the gap behind the Shrine (inside the cave, not near the outer platforms) and defeat Captain Lotus-Vision to obtain the Curios. It is quite a difficult fight, but our boss breakdown and guide has tons of tips to help you out.
