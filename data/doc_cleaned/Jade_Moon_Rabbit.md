# Jade Moon Rabbit

The Jade Moon Rabbit is one of the many Curios items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. 

With the Jade Moon Rabbit equipped your damage reduction is slightly increased. This effect is enhanced when you have the Gold Sun Crow also equipped. 

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Jade Moon Rabbit Location

The Jade Moon Rabbit Curios item is dropped by Zhu Bajie upon defeating him in The Webbed Hollow.
