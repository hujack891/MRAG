# Azure Dome

Azure Dome is the final of the Transformation Spells in Black Myth: Wukong and one of the trickiest to find, requiring you to obtain the secret ending. 

With the Transformation equipped, you can transform into a stone monkey, gaining immunity to Shock and Poison. At the same time, you are able to absorb and convert Frost and Scorch to empower yourself, retaining access to the Destined One's Spells and converting any pre-transformation Focus for use afterward. 

This spell is one of the most powerful thanks to its moveset: 

  * **Light Attack: Primal Punch - Unleash a rapid flurry of punches, building up Focus.** This is an immensely effective, series of rapid punches that deal a large amount of damage, building up Focus at the same time. 
  * Heavy Attack: Earthshatter Slam - Leap into the air, bringing both fists down with an earth-shattering strike. This attack can be charged. This chargable attack can be used on its own or in conjunction with Monkey Mind to deal a powerful slam. 
  * Spell: Monkey Mind - Build up Focus and cast a variety of spells. Upon casting the Spell, you can deal a variety of different powerful attacks by asborbing elemental effects nearby, dealing extra damage.
