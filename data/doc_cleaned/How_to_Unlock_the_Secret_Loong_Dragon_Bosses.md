# How to Unlock the Secret Loong Dragon Bosses

Chapter 1 of Black Myth: Wukong has more than one secret boss for you to find, and one of these is a Dragon that's tucked away behind a waterfall. Getting to the boss, however, requires finding a key item that you can't get until Chapter 2. This isn't the only Loong boss you can find in the game, so if you want to access the secret area, and know the whereabouts of the Loong Dragon Bosses, here's everything you need to know.

## How to Get the Loong Scales

If you've managed to fight what feels like all available bosses in Chapter 1 and still finished it with a missing entry from your journal, don't fear! You'll actually need to make some progress through Chapter 2 until you can find the key item that will allow you to gain access to the area and tick off the last boss from Chapter 1.

The item you're looking for is the **Loong Scales** , and they're cleverly hidden away just beyond Sandgate Village. After the mini-boss fight against the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, follow the golden trail to find the next Keeper's Shrine. From here, enter the nearby cave. 

In the main room of this cave, you'll find a pit, and near it is a wall where a section has lots of tiny statues carved into it. You'll need to **break this wall to reveal a crack** that will allow you to squeeze through it. Inside, you can find the Loong Scales in a treasure chest.

Breaking the wall is a little bit trickier than it seems because it requires **an especially powerful attack** , and what happens in the pit also depends on how the fight with the King of Flowing Sands went. You'll either see a cutscene if you let him live or need to use a Pungent Flesh Chunk to get the First Prince of Flowing Sands to appear if you killed him.

If you're lucky, you can actually use the First Prince of Flowing Sands to crack the wall for you if you are able to bait him into lunging into the wall. Alternatively, you can use a spirit such as the Wandering Wight Spirit and transform into it to use the head bash and split the wall.

Once you've picked them up from the treasure chest, a voice will begin speaking to you. This will also happen when you're near the bosses, but now that you've collected the Loong Scales, you're ready to unlock some secret areas! 

## How to Find Red Loong - Chapter 1 Secret Dragon Boss

You’ll need to return to Chapter 1 and the Black Wind Mountain once you have the Loong Scales. Use a Keeper’s Shrine to return to Outside the Forest. From here, head straight up toward the two wolves. 

![Secret Loong Bosses \(2\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a4/Secret_Loong_Bosses_%282%29.png)

Take the first left, past the big stone rock. And then follow it around to the right. This will bring you to the section of the path, where there’s a small bridge going right and a chest on the left. Head down toward the chest, and a voice should start speaking to you. 

![Secret Loong Bosses \(3\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/45/Secret_Loong_Bosses_%283%29.png)

From here, you should be able to see the waterfall up ahead. This is where you need to head for. Take the path down, and go toward the stream. Then turn left, and you can climb up the green mossy rocks. 

![Secret Loong Bosses \(1\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b6/Secret_Loong_Bosses_%281%29.png)

Jump over the tree branch and head toward the waterfall and the enemy waiting outside of it. If you have the Loong Scales, you’ll see an Examine prompt appear, but you’ll need to deal with the nearby enemy first. When the area is clear, press Examine to make the waterfall disappear and a hole in the wall will appear.

For Chapter 2, you'll want to wait until you've got to the Rockrest Flat Keeper's Shrine in Yellow Wind Ridge. If you're facing the Keeper's Shrine, turn to the right and head all the way up the stairs. If you haven't already collected it, you'll be able to fight a Spearbone here for a Spirit.

This one is slightly different than the bosses you'll find in Chapters 1 and 2, as there's nothing you need to interact with. Instead, play through Chapter 3 until you reach the Bitter Lake and the Turtle Island Keeper's Shrine. 

![Secret Loong Bosses \(20\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/49/Secret_Loong_Bosses_%2820%29.png)

You'll need to wait until you can interact with the Shrine, but when you can, turn and face the water. As you walk toward it, you'll hear a voice again. Look toward the edge of the cliff and down to the left slightly, to see a Dragon Statue that sits by the water. 

![Secret Loong Bosses \(22\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e6/Secret_Loong_Bosses_%2822%29.png)

As you approach the statue, it will come to life and you'll be thrown into a fight against Cyan Loong. When you've beaten him, a Treasure Chest will appear in the nearby waterfall, which contains Breath of Fire Soak and Mountain-Shaking Core. You'll also unlock the crafting recipe for the mythical Golden Loong Staff.

## How to Find Yellow Loong - Chapter 4 Secret Boss

Progress through Chapter 4 until you reach the Cliff of Oblivion Keeper's Shrine. You'll pass through a corridor beyond it, where you'll meet Buddha's Right Hand. 

![How To Find Yellow Loong \(2\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/45/How_To_Find_Yellow_Loong_%282%29.png)

After this fight, the hand will become a bridge that you can use to get down to the lower levels. Go across the hand and the insect body attached to it, then drop down from the wooden path. 

Follow the path around to the right and continue following it as it loops. You'll come to a point where you see a wooden path going off to the left, with a bridge, or the path continues to the right.

Drop down to the left and head toward the bridge, crossing it to get to the other side. Go up the stairs and through the corridor filled with webs. Up ahead, you'll see a light and cocoons hanging from the ceiling. 

![How To Find Yellow Loong .png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/37/How_To_Find_Yellow_Loong_.png)

There's a bridge here you can cross, but you'll need to do it very carefully and avoid being hit by the spiders inside the sacs. You can take them out or just zip across using Cloud Step.

When you get to the other side, continue on to the grassy area, then head to the left to go up the stairs. Follow this path and the voice that has narrated each of the Loong boss encounters so far will begin again. 

![How To Find Yellow Loong \(6\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/85/How_To_Find_Yellow_Loong_%286%29.png)

The path will start to wind back up, and there will be stairs on the left and a broken bridge on the right. Head right across the broken boards, to find the Relief of the Fallen Loong Keeper's Shrine.

From here, continue up the stairs to the right and you'll see a figure waiting by the shelter. As you approach, a cutscene will begin and you'll be thrown into the fight against Yellow Loong.
