# Gold Ridge Beast

The Gold Ridge Beast is one of the Treasures in Black Myth: Wukong. Unlike other Crafting Materials, this can be sold as soon as you get it. 

The item has no practical use, besides giving you some extra Will once sold. This is the highest rarity of Treasure and there is only one in the game.

The Gold Ridge Beast can be found in Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge within the secret Kingdom of Shahali area. It is located in a chest on the far side of the area. You must open this chest before you defeat Fuban as the area becomes inaccessible once the boss is defeated.
