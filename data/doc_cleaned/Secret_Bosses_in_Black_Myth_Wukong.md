# Secret Bosses in Black Myth Wukong

Black Myth: Wukong has a wealth of secrets to discover, from Transformation Spells to hidden Key Items and, of course, bosses. While some secret bosses can be found through exploration, others are well-hidden and require completing NPC questlines, collecting multiple items, or even fighting mini-bosses to make them emerge. Here's a breakdown of all the secret bosses in the game, organised by chapter. 

Secret Bosses in Chapter 1| Secret Bosses in Chapter 2| Secret Bosses in Chapter 3

Secret Bosses in Chapter 4| Secret Bosses in Chapter 5| Secret Bosses in Chapter 6  

# Secret Bosses in Chapter 1

Chapter 1 has two secret bosses for you to take on. The first can be found in the chapter's secret area Secret: Ancient Guanyin Temple; the second, you'll find behind a waterfall, but only after collecting the Loong Scales from Chapter 2. 

## Elder Jinchi

To access the secret version of the Ancient Guanyin Temple, you'll need to ring 3 bells that are guarded by 3 other bosses you'll encounter in Chapter 1. When you do this, you'll be automatically transported to the secret location, where you can fight Elder Jinchi. Defeating him grants you the Fireproof Mantle Vessel, which can be a huge help in this Chapter.

After collecting the Loong Scales in Chapter 2, return to Chapter 1 to find Red Loong. From the Outside the Forest Keeper's Shrine in Forest of Wolves, head to the nearby waterfalls. With the Scales in your possession, you can now enter the waterfall and fight Red Loong.

When you've got the Loong Scales, you can also access the secret boss in Chapter 2 that you can find behind a sandfall. From Rockrest Flat Keeper's Shrine, go right and up the stairs to find the sandfall. With the Loong Scales in your inventory, you can step right through it into the hidden cave.

## The Mad Tiger in the Well

It's not just the Tiger Vanguard you can take down in Chapter 2, you can also find a Mad Tiger. First, find the Tiger's Acolyte in Windgate Village. He'll drop an Old Rattle-Drum which you can use in three spots across the chapter to uncover its secret. Once you've found all three and used the drum, a well will be revealed near Sandgate Village. Drop down into it and go head-to-head with the Mad Tiger.

Chapter 3 had the purple seals, but Chapter 4 has the Purple Talismans. Collecting all four and getting the final one at the Court of Illumination lets you have an early visit with the Supreme Inspector. 

Supreme Inspector

## The Scorpionlord

![Secrets Black Myth Wukong .png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/83/Secrets_Black_Myth_Wukong_.png)

Chapter 4's secret area is called the Purple Cloud Mountain and there are 3 bosses to fight here! Scorpionlord can be found near the Bounds of Deity's Abode Keeper's Shrine. Smash his precious pots and he'll start a fight. 

The Scorpionlord

### Don't Miss This Boss!

We've listed the secret bosses in Purple Cloud Mountain in a particular order because players have reported that this is a missable encounter. For that reason, we'd recommend tackling the Scorpionlord first when you're in Purple Cloud Mountain. 

## Daoist Mi

Daoist Mi

![Secrets Black Myth Wukong \(2\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c4/Secrets_Black_Myth_Wukong_%282%29.png)

Daoist Mi can be found near the Petalfall Hamlet Keeper's Shrine. He'll ask you to find Violet Hail for him, which you can get from the yellow-robed enemies in the area. Return to him with Violet Hail and you'll get to fight him and gain a spell! 

### Don't Miss This Boss!

Just like The Scorpionlord, you won't be able to fight Daoist Mi if you head straight for The Duskveil. We'd recommend tackling him second, as you make your way up to Cloudnest Peak. 

## The Duskveil

![Secrets Black Myth Wukong \(3\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a6/Secrets_Black_Myth_Wukong_%283%29.png)

Head to Cloudnest Peak for The Duskveil. This is the final boss of the secret area, so killing it will trigger a cutscene and transport you out of the area. You'll also receive the Weaver's Needle Vessel from completing this fight. 

The Duskveil

# Secret Bosses in Chapter 5

All of the secret bosses in Chapter 5 can be found in the secret area. This is revealed when the spiked iron ball stops terrorizing you along a path. When you head back along that same path, the flames will have disappeared, and instead, you can go down the Cooling Slope. 

## Mother of Flamlings

![Wukong Secrets \(1\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a0/Wukong_Secrets_%281%29.png)

Mother of Flamlings is one of 3 bosses that will drop Samadhi Fire Crystals in Chapter 5. But getting mother's attention requires a delivery. She'll only accept payment in the form of 4 Flame Ores, so get to killing the Flamlings in the area. Once you've handed over the ores, she'll appear from the ground. 

Mother of Flamlings

## Baw-Lang-Lang

![Secrets Wukong \(6\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d1/Secrets_Wukong_%286%29.png)

Baw-Lang-Lang can be found at the start of the Bishui Cave but not technically in it. Once you've completed the five cart questline and smashed through the frozen door of the Bishui Cave, you'll want to head inside and down to the left to find another of the frog bosses. 

Baw-Lang-Lang

## Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top

![Secrets Wukong \(1\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f8/Secrets_Wukong_%281%29.png)

Inside Bishui Cave, Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top are the first bosses you'll encounter. You'll get to them just after the Purge Pit Keeper's Shrine

The last of the bosses in Bishui Cave is the Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast beyond the corridor of Fire and Ice.

# Secret Bosses in Chapter 6

### Ending Spoilers!

As you enter Chapter 6, you'll be reaching the conclusion of the game. While the last Chapter does have a secret boss, you should proceed with caution as the last secret boss relates to the ending of the game.   

SPOILERS AHEAD! 

## Giant Shigandang

![Five Skandhas \(26\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/00/Five_Skandhas_%2826%29.png)

You'll need to collect four Skandhas across Chapters 1-4 to be able to reveal the Giant Shigandang in Chapter 6. The Skandhas to collect are: 

  * Chapter 1 - Skandha of Form
  * Chapter 2 - Skandha of Feeling
  * Chapter 3 - Skandha of Thought
  * Chapter 4 - Skanda of Choice

See our page on How to Find the Five Skandhas and Unlock a Secret Boss for detailed information on getting each of them.

## Erlang, the Sacred Divinity

![Secret Bosses Wukong .png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/85/Secret_Bosses_Wukong_.png)

In Chapter 3 of the game, you may have already visited The Great Pagoda. This is where tapestries are hung after you've completed chapters of the game. 

However, there is a final spot that can be unlocked if you meet the right conditions. You'll need to finish the secret areas from each chapter by beating the final bosses in each one and finish the questline for the Green-Capped Martialist from Chapter 3. 

When you return to The Great Pagoda, a cutscene will play as you head toward the top of the room. You'll also unlock the secret area, which is Mount Mei. Waiting for you here, is Erlang, the Sacred Divinity. 

You can head to Mount Mei as soon as you complete the secret areas and the Treasure Hunter quest. But we've included these bosses as part of Chapter 6, as we'd recommend completing the game first and then pressing CONTINUE, going to Mount Mei and beating the secret bosses there. Beating the final boss again after doing this will unlock the true ending of the game. 

Erlang, the Sacred Divinity

## The Four Heavenly Kings and Erlan Shang

When the battle with Erlang, the Sacred Divinity is over, you'll then need to take on The Four Heavenly Kings. The final part of this epic battle is to take on Erlang Shen.
