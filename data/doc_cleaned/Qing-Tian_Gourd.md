# Qing-Tian Gourd

The Qian-Tian Gourd is the most unique Gourd in Black Myth: Wukong, with an ability unlike any of the other Gourds. It's strength and one-of-a-kind nature mean it can't be upgraded at all at the Shen Monkey Vendor. 

With the Gourd equipped, using it will cause your Gourd uses to slowly recover. However, the catch is you only have one use of the Qing-Tian Gourd, so you will have to wait for each charge to recover after use. This makes it entirely unique when compared to everything else in the game. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Qing-Tian Gourd Location

The Qing-Tian Gourd can be found at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Black Wind Mountain. However, it will only become available after you kill every type of enemy in the game to obtain all the portrait data. This covers the 90 Lesser Yaoguai enemies, the 55 Yaoguai Chiefs, and the 26 Yaoguai Kings. You will also need to meet every character (all 32 of them). 

Once you have found all this data, the Gourd will only set you back 66 Will at the Shen Monkey Vendor.
