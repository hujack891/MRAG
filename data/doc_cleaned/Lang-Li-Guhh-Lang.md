## Where to Find Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang

Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang is located early on after entering the Valley of Ecstasy proper, which requires sliding down a large snowy slope from the Mindfulness Cliff after crossing the Bitter Lake.

As soon as you arrive in the Forest of Felicity, you can find two small tunnels in the ridge on the left, one before and after the Shrine, and both lead to a canyon with a frozen pond where the frog boss waits for you. 

### Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang Miniboss Fight and Guide

Like the two Frog Guai before him, Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang is a formidable foe with surprising reach, and if you thought you'd seen everything a frog boss could do, you're sadly in for a surprise. Much as Chapter 2's frog boss was imbued with lightning attacks, so too does this boss have the power of ice on his side, and unless you take precautions, you'll be frozen solid and out of stamina -- unable to move while you're torn to pieces. 

Having body warming medicine for this fight is a must, and it's highly recommended you equip the Frostspout Twig Curio, Fiery Gourd, and Circle of Fire Spell to offset his many frost-filled attacks.

While you've likely seen what a Frog boss can do with their extremely quick belly thrusts, rear kick attacks, and jump slashes, there's a lot of new tricks up this yaoguai chief's sleeve. Many of his moves, including his arm swipes that end with a slam, will now create a field of frost upon the frozen lake.

His tongue-lashing attack has now been altered to be even more deadly: It will create fields of frost on the ground as it swings back and forth -- and also lob rocks at you each time his tongue whips back, forcing you to stay mobile out of the frost and dodging the boulders at the same time.

He can also take a deep breath and bellow chilled air straight at you, which can make it tough to get out of his range unless you lock him down with Immobilize or Cloud Step away. 

Any time his icy attacks create a frost field, you'll need to evacuate quickly from the affected area, or you'll rapidly become chilled and eventually immobile while your stamina is sapped. 

Remember to take control of the battlefield, and dictate where the fighting happens by luring him away from any lingering frost field that tend to stay longer than you'd expect. He'll always end up coming to you, so back up and be ready to retaliate when he lunges forth.

Certain times, Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang will also let out a loud screech, causing ice shards to form at various points around the arena. Stay mobile and away a good distance away, but not too far. 

After his screech, he'll crouch down and perform another bellow that sends a shockwave out, exploding all the crystals to deal additional frost damage to you. Since it's a bit harder to evade, you can get in a bit closer and prop yourself up on the Pillar Stance to evade the attack, then send your staff smashing down on him after the explosion.

While he doesn't have a ton of health or as much defense as other bosses, he can still get even more dangerous when low on health. His standard arm attack combo can be supercharged, causing icy explosions in a line from each of his swipes, and causing his slam to build up a giant frost area below him while also boxing you in a ring of icy crystals. 

Surviving this can be very tough as he'll try to keep you trapped and locked in his icy lair until you can't move, and then follow up with a loud screech to explode the icy and rocks around him, or perform another follow-up attack.

As with his other big attack, your Pillar Stance can help keep you away from the blast, but you can also try creating a Ring of Fire to give yourself "holy ground" of sorts to stay safe in from the otherwise chilly prison. 

Defeat this third frog menace, and you'll gain another Tadpole and other materials to upgrade your Spirits and gear.
