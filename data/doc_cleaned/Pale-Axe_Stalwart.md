# Pale-Axe Stalwart

The Pale-Axe Stalwart is a Character boss you'll go up against at the start of Chapter 5 in Black Myth: Wukong. After defeating the imposing Stalwart, you'll be asked to complete a side quest for him.

From the first Keeper's Shrine of the Chapter, go right. On the other side of the underpass, you'll walk straight into another round of fighting. This time, you'll find the Revenants fighting Bull Sergeants.

Before you go over to them, harvest the **Fire Bellflower** by the Buddha statue on the right. Then, go straight up and into the midst of the fighting, to find the Pale-Axe Stalwart taking on nearby Revenants. Alongside the fighting, the area is also being pelted with firebombs so having the Fireproof Mantle Vessel here can help you focus more on the fighting and less on the fire attacks.

The health bar for the Pale-Axe Stalwart will appear as soon as you approach the open area. There will be Revenants and Bull Soldiers fighting around you, but you can ignore these and focus solely on the Pale-Axe Stalwart for this miniboss fight.

He uses a huge axe, so most of his attacks are slow swings. The main approach to this fight should be to dodge the slow attacks, then immediately follow up with a combo as he takes time to recover.

Occasionally, he will kick at you or jump up in the air, raising his axe above him. When he does the latter, he will slam it down as he lands, but even with this move, dodging is still the way to go.

The most beneficial thing to you here is the fire from above. He is also impacted by the fire attacks, so watch where the projectiles land and bait him into standing in the vicinity of them. This will build up his Fire Damage, weakening his health bar while you attack, and also completely stagger him at times, leaving him vulnerable to longer combos and heavier attacks.

When you've knocked his health bar almost all the way down, he will kneel. To make the area safer, clear out the rest of the fighting Yaoguais, then approach the Pale-Axe Stalwart, who will now become an NPC with his own side quest for you to complete.
