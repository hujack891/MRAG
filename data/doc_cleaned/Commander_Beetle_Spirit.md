## Commander Beetle Fight

The Commander Beetle fight is a tough one since the beetle is so strong, and he has a whole class of monks to tackle at the same time. Using a Pluck of Many to take care of a majority of the monks is a good idea to start with. That way, you can focus on the Commander Beetle alone. 

When fighting the Commander Beetle, watch out for its two sweeping swords that create a delayed shockwave in the air that slices you moments after the attack is complete. The Commander Beetle also shoots a volley of projectiles from its head that deal poison damage. Antimiasma Powder could come in handy in this fight.

  * **Blade Flurry**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Poison Resistance. 

The Commander Beetle's Spirit allows you to take the form of the Commander Beetle and slash at your foes with the two long swords it wields. This attack is very powerful initially, but also creates a whirlwind that detonates moments after the first attack, dealing area damage to your enemies. The equipped effect increases Poison Resistance, making the Commander Beetle a great Spirit to channel when exploring the Webbed Hollow.
