## Where to Find Yellowbrow

As a required boss fight, you'll encounter Yellowbrow at the top of the New Thunderclap Temple located beyond the Valley of Ecstasy. You need only follow the main path from the Temple Entrance Shrine and courtyard through the central plaza, and up a stairway where two Dark-faced Overlords guard the final stairs to the Mahavira Hall. 

Yellowbrow is actually a two-part boss fight, and will include a secondary boss fight in between your first and final encounter with the boss of Chapter 3. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 72.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/73/Wukong_Thunderclap_72.jpg)

After resting at the Mahavira Hall Shrine at the top of the stairs, be sure to take assessment of your gear. Cultivate your best Spirits, make sure you have a lot of pills on hand an craft a bunch of extra Shock-Quelling Powder (you're going to need it). 

You should also have any anti-shock gear/curios/soaks on hand as well, along with whatever else can keep you alive for awhile. This final encounter is spread out into three distinct fights, and while you'll be able to respawn and pick up where you left off for the first two sections from the Shrine, the final section won't take you back to the Shrine.

## Yellowbrow Boss Fight and Guide

No longer the small chubby monk you've seen previously, this much larger giant of a man is an incredibly dangerous and formidable foe, and uses a host of lightning attacks to try and inflict Shock status on you. Taking double damage from any of his attacks is highly inadvisable, so make sure your Shock-Quelling Powder is on your quickbar for this fight. 

Yellowbrow chiefly attacks with a large spiked mace while he holds his magic seedbag in the other hand. Be incredibly wary of his weapon, as it has the ability to change its shape, and he can extend the handle at will both in size, length, and flexibility. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 73.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a3/Wukong_Thunderclap_73.jpg)

To start, Yellowbrow will often charge up his spiked mace before thrusting it right at you, increasing its length and size with surprising reach. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 74.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/aa/Wukong_Thunderclap_74.jpg)

Expect him to follow up this attack be retracting it, and then slamming it over his head down in front of him with another ranged mid-range attack. 

These two attacks have a lot of weight to them, and leave him with considerable openings to get in plenty of hits while he retracts his weapon and resets his posture, so make the most of them! 

![Wukong Thunderclap 81.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/ba/Wukong_Thunderclap_81.jpg)

If he slams his mace straight into the ground directly in front of him with the handle up, back off and wait for him to charge it up. He'll slide it along the ground in a sweep around him, which will then send out a shockwave you'll either want to jump or Pillar Stance over (just make sure you're out of range of his sweep when you do). 

![Wukong Thunderclap 75.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7f/Wukong_Thunderclap_75.jpg)

At range, he'll often swing his mace upward several times, sending electrical currents along the ground toward you. They aren't too bad to deal with, so long as you strafe to the side as you advance and avoid their paths. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 76.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e8/Wukong_Thunderclap_76.jpg)

After fighting for a bit, Yellowbrow will often vanish into thin air, but you can get a heads up on where he's going by looking for his shadow on the ground and which direction it darts off to. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 78.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b0/Wukong_Thunderclap_78.jpg)

Early on, he'll reappear just to gloat, and if you see him raise his arms in a taunt, that's your cue to retaliate by expending your focus points to hit him hard. Three Focus Points on a Pillar Heavy Strike can often send him staggering to his knees, giving you a lot of opportunity to continue your assault. 

Just be warned that as the battle progresses, he'll come out of his vanishing act with another attack prepped, so you'll need to both find his new position (or listen for it), and react quickly. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 77.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1a/Wukong_Thunderclap_77.jpg)

When he starts to chastise you and proclaim you "insolent", watch for him to wave his mace around to create small little motes of electricity around his head. Hang back when he does this, and wait for a moment for the orbs to come racing in your direction. Use your staff spin to quickly clear them out, while being ready to dodge if Yellowbrow employs another attack. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 79.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7a/Wukong_Thunderclap_79.jpg)

As he starts getting madder, his attacks will start to have more range. Simple sweeping strikes of his mace can alter to have his weapon handle extend to bend the weapon around his back to cover a wider arc and catch you with. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 80.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6d/Wukong_Thunderclap_80.jpg)

If you see his foot rise as it crackles with electricity, you're better off staying back, as you can be knocked into the air of his stomp connects, which turns into a "grab" where he'll pierce you with his mace and slam you into the ground for a ton of damage. It's still possible to deflect the stomp with Rock Solid or rise above it with your Pillar Stance, but if you're not sure on the timing, just play it safe. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 82.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b6/Wukong_Thunderclap_82.jpg)

Once he gets to around half his health or less, be especially prepared for his ultimate attack. He'll usually begin by proclaiming that he will "meet you in combat, devoid of any relics", and charge his weapon above his head, drawing in a much large amount of crackling energy above his head and motes all around. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 83.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9b/Wukong_Thunderclap_83.jpg)

Once all the motes coalesce into his weapon, he'll slam it into the ground to create a massive electrical storm, and soon after, a giant detonation that can usually kill you in a single hit. This attack can't be dodged (even in Pillar Stance), but it can be outrun if you flee to the far corners of the room away from him (though it still has a mighty range). 

If you feel like you can't escape in time, you can also try interrupting this attack - the Wind Tamer Vessel is a great pick for this as it will stun him no matter what he's doing! 

![Wukong Thunderclap 84.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/ba/Wukong_Thunderclap_84.jpg)

Finally, in his angered state he can also unleash a much longer combo attack, often while yelling about how he's going to guide the world. If you can't get enough distance from him, be ready to try deflecting or Immobilizing him, or you'll have to dodge a series of three sweeping attacks as he slides his mace along the ground, then swings it over his head four times, followed by a large windup as he pulls it around from behind his back in one large sweeping strikes. 

The better understanding you have of his attacks and their range, the more ready you'll be to deal with each of them in turn, evading his lightining strikes and quelling any shock status to minimize damage. Use the downtimes from his slower attacks to hit him hard with Spirit Attacks and expending your Focus Points to stagger him onto the ground. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 85.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/42/Wukong_Thunderclap_85.jpg)

Once you've taken out his entire health bar, he'll disappear again, sometimes summoning a lightning storm to track you as you try and race back over to him. Take it slow and focus on evasion rather than trying to close the distance. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 86.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a8/Wukong_Thunderclap_86.jpg)

This battle may be won, but the war is far from over. Yellowbrow will freeze you in place, and use his magic seed sack to draw you into a perilous prison. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 87.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ed/Wukong_Thunderclap_87.jpg)

You'll need to defeat the Macaque Chief inside his magic sack to escape, whereupon you'll be transported to his floating shelf, and you'll be able to fight him one last time. 

## Yellowbrow Boss Fight (Second Encounter)

![Wukong Thunderclap 101.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d6/Wukong_Thunderclap_101.jpg)

When this final match begins, you'll still be stuck in the Macaque Chief form, but only for a short duration (and won't return to this form if you die and respawn) so you might as well unleash as many attacks as possible while you can. 

Yellowbrow has a lot of his same moves from your last fight, but several new ones that are even more devious and annoying to deal with. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 102.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/14/Wukong_Thunderclap_102.jpg)

The one you'll likely encounter fairly early on is his new ability to cast himself in a gold-plated protection form. 

In this form, your attacks will simply bounce off like the Tiger Vanguard's Stone Form, but he won't readily revert back, and continue to attack in this impervious form. 

Instead, you'll want to find openings to hit him back with a heavy attack. If you have any Focus Points stored up, you can briefly stagger him, but even without any focus points its a better alternative than getting knocked back trying to use a light attack. You can also try ingesting consumables that raise your focus for an easier time breaking his gold form. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 104.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b3/Wukong_Thunderclap_104.jpg)

After 2-3 heavy hits (or a single heavy strike with 3 focus points), his golden protection will shatter, and leave Yellowbrow stunned for an extended period of time. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 107.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d8/Wukong_Thunderclap_107.jpg)

Use this period to unleash your best Spirit Attack (Non-Pure's extended combo can be huge here as he's unable to attack back) and hit him with your biggest stikes while he's unable to move. 

When he regains his composure, he'll strike back with more lightning attacks than ever, and once again you'll need to be extremely careful about not retaining the Shocked status, or you'll often die from a single stray blow. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 103.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/19/Wukong_Thunderclap_103.jpg)

One of his hardest hitting new attacks will start with him holding his mace up and imbuing it with light, causing a huge light to shine out from its end as he holds it back over his head. 

You'll need to avoid this overhead strike at all costs by rapidly strafing and dodging around him, as the vertical slam will cause that giant bolt of lightning to cleave the ground, creating a permanent electric scar in the ground (and will almost certainly cleave more than half your health on hit, or instantly kill you if you're taking double damage from a Shocked state). 

![Wukong Thunderclap 106.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7a/Wukong_Thunderclap_106.jpg)

The scar will persist and continue to deal lightning damage if you walk too close to it, and as you learn this attack, you may want to try baiting him into slamming down in a corner to cover the least amount of ground. 

Among his more familiar attacks, he can also detonate his mace after slamming into the ground after a short delay, so be ready if you notice the mace continue to glow (if it doesn't, you'll be a bit safer to engage near his weapon). 

Other times, these detonations can trigger a series of lightning bolts to explode outward around him, both spreading in a line from his strikes and also seeking you out. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 105.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/44/Wukong_Thunderclap_105.jpg)

This second fight is spaced into three phases, during which Yellowbrow will stop the fight momentarily to string you about like a rag doll. This means you can only take a third of his health bar off before he'll stop taking damage and stun you, which is worth noting so that you don't try and unleash a huge stored up attack when he's about to start a new phase. 

Even worse, when you take off the first third of his health, he'll stun you with electricity and then smack you around with his mace. This unavoidable cutscene actually takes off around 40% of your health, and is what we like to call a dick move. 

He'll usually begin the next phase of the fight be performing another of his electrical cleaving attacks to tear another part of the ground, and with your low health, you'll need to quickly heal up or evade or risk an instant death! 

![Wukong Thunderclap 113.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fa/Wukong_Thunderclap_113.jpg)

In his second phase, he'll often throw in more attacks into the mix, including a deadly binding spell that creates a ring of electricity around you. You'll be unable to escape this ring, and he will start tossing projectiles at you that you'll need to spin your staff to get rid of. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 114.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Wukong_Thunderclap_114.jpg)

Luckily, he'll usually stand around gloating after this, giving you time to heal up and ingest more consumables to buff up until the ring dissipates (You can also use Wind Tamer to immediately dispel the ring if you don't feel like waiting). 

![Wukong Thunderclap 112.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/17/Wukong_Thunderclap_112.jpg)

Other times, he can now raise his mace up to trigger a lightning storm all around the arena. These strikes will both track your position and also appear all over the arena, making it tough to evade them all unless you can stagger him out of it. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 110.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/06/Wukong_Thunderclap_110.jpg)

If he starts to channel energy within himself, watch for light to shine out of his body and electrical threads appear all around. You'll need to quickly sprint away as the very air around him will raise your shock meter, and after a few moments, he'll explode and deal a lethal amount of damage in a very large radius. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 109.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f3/Wukong_Thunderclap_109.jpg)

When you finally reach the last third of Yellowbrow's health, he'll again toss you into the air, and this time the Apramana Bat will catch you and fling you around. You'll actually gain the Apramana Bat Spirit during this sequence, and fly right at him only to be knocked to the ground - again taking off a chunk of your health in an unavoidable scene. 

In this final phase, Yellowbrow is more likely than ever to summon his giant lighting blast again as he creates motes of lightning all around him, meaning you'll need to race to the far corner or use something like the Wind Tamer to snap him out of it. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 111.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1d/Wukong_Thunderclap_111.jpg)

He can also more frequently employ lots of very deadly moves, like repeatedly swinging his electrified mace around him in multiple arcs with large electric waves of force that have an additional delayed detonation. 

You'll need to play things very smart and cautious now, and don't be afraid to pause and use additional consumables, including rare ones given by the Xu Dog in the Zodiac Village. This match is a true endurance test, and you'll want to use everything in your arsenal to keep Yellowbrow on the defensive. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 108.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/97/Wukong_Thunderclap_108.jpg)

If you've run out of juice from your gourd, consider consuming medicine to increase your max health, or swap to a Transformation Spell to survive attacks you may not otherwise live through. 

With enough patience and practice, and dodging his particularly deadly attacks, you'll at last cut Yellowbrow down to size. He'll try to flee the temple back onto the frozen lake at Mirrormere, only to be swallowed up by the Sage's Relic under the lake.
