# Boshan Censer

The Boshan Censer is a rare Curios item you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. While it has a specific use, the Boshan Censer's buff is rather strong, making it quite useful for those who like to play aggressive when they are out of healing. 

With the Boshan Censer equipped, it grants considerable damage reduction when Gourd use is depleted. So, if you are someone who hasn't upgraded their Gourd or is running a Gourd with a low amount of uses, this can be incredibly powerful, granting you enhanced survivability for an extended period. Dodge masters and those using Cloud Step and Rock Solid can really benefit from this Curios item.

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or boost the effect of them. Therefore, you will want to switch to other Curios items to better fit your build as you play if needed. This can be done easily from the game's Equipment menu. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Boshan Censer Location

The Boshan Censer can be found upon defeating Red Loong in the Forest of Wolves \- Outside the Forest area in Black Wind Mountain. Red Loong is located behind the waterfall in Black Wind Mountain, and you will need to obtain the Loong Scales in Yellow Wind Ridge first to enter this secret area. 

The Loong Scales are a rather well hidden item in Yellow Wind Ridge, requiring you to have the First Prince of Flowing Sands boss destroy a wall with its attack. You can also destroy it with the powerful Transformation Spells. Our guide below on how to get behind the waterfall will take you through the steps, alongside the links above to the individual places. 

Once you have defeated Red Loong, you can open the chest to finish everything in the area, obtaining the Boshan Censer in the process.
