# Cloudtreading Deer

Cloudtreading Deer is one of the main Yaoguai Chiefs you'll need to find in Chapter 6 of Black Myth: Wukong. This two-phase fight will have you facing frost and poison, in order to get a key piece of Wukong's armor. 

## How to Find Cloudtreading Deer

When you've beaten the third Poison Chief, head over to the start of the red trees. As you enter the clearing with the lightning, you'll find the next Keeper's Shrine on the left.

Activate the Deer Sight Forest Keeper's Shrine and go toward the lightning and red tree in the middle of the clearing. Underneath the tree sits the Cloudtreading Deer.

The Cloudtreading Deer will try to put as much distance as possible between you, so you'll want to use spells like Immobilize to keep it in place or Cloudstep to catch up to it. There are two phases to this fight, and aggression is key in the first one, so you can get to the second phase in as little time as possible with spells left over.

It will start by attacking with its horns, sweeping at you to try and hit you. It will also rear up, and hold itself for a few seconds, before slamming down and sending out ripples of frost damage. If you get behind it, just like the Rhino, it will buck to kick you with its hind legs.

In this first phase, you'll want to have plenty of Body-Warming Powder, as the Cloudtreading Deer uses frost as its elemental attacks. But the most dangerous aspect of this first stage is the fact that the deer sends out lots of little tornadoes. While the small whirlwinds of ice are easy to dodge, these tornadoes are much harder to avoid and also signal when the deer will ramp up its attacks.

To make the first part of this fight easier, we'd recommend equipping the Wind Tamer as your vessel. It will wipe these tornadoes out as soon as you use it, and mean there's one less thing to focus on. The deer will still leap in the air and tread the clouds to attack you, but you won't need to worry about being hit by the annoying tornadoes. While this is useful once, you'll obviously need to wait for it to become available again, and in the meantime, the deer will continue to use this attack.

If you're taking it on without the vessel, the best thing you can do is get as far away from the tornadoes as possible and let the deer come to you. You'll be able to get a better look at it like this, while it jumps around in the air and prepares to slam into the ground. When it lands, dodge or jump to avoid the shockwave of frost, and then go all in on attacking the deer.

When it seems like the fight is over, it's just getting started and entering its second phase. Blood will spill from the deer and pool all around it. The blood will poison you, so you'll want Antimiasma Powder to help you deal with any damage that comes from it.

In this phase, you'll need to avoid the pools of blood. There are also some projectiles, where little orbs of blood will float up in the air and then hone in on you. Thankfully, you'll have a little bit of help with this one, as Zhu Bajie will appear in the second phase to give you a hand.

This part of the fight is more about managing how long you can stand in the blood for, and jumping back out when you're about to be completely poisoned. Try to bait the deer to run out of the patches of blood, and into the ice where you can attack it freely. You can also use the Wind Vessel in this phase to down the deer temporarily.
