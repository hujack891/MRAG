# Crouching Tiger Temple Walkthrough

The Crouching Tiger Temple is one of two possible second main regions of Chapter 2 in the Yellow Wind Ridge of Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide for the Temple and its main boss fight against the Tiger Vanguard, as well as the secret Cellar beneath it once you have the Keeness of Tiger.

  * **Temple Cellar**

The Crouching Tiger Temple is one of the two sub-regions you’ll need to explore in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong in order to unlock the large sealed doors that lead to the end of the chapter. You can first reach this area by heading through the Sandgate Village and defeating the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, taking the left path through the Valley of Despair and through a crack in the wall leading to a small canyon.

Exiting the tunnels of the Valley of Despair and fending off a few Swift Bats, you’ll spot the imposing Crouching Tiger Temple down a narrow canyon. There’s some **Aged Ginseng** and **Licorice** to harvest along the path, but beyond that there isn’t much to worry about in terms of enemies. 

### Temple Entrance

![Wukong Tiger 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/38/Wukong_Tiger_1.jpg)

After resting at the Shrine at the foot the temple, head up its foreboding steps into the temple’s front gate. The path is strewn with the meat of many a Rat Guai sacrifice — a sacrifice to whom you’ll soon find out. 

![Wukong Tiger 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/96/Wukong_Tiger_2.jpg)

Be sure to stop and look to the right as you begin to climb the steps, and you’ll find an alcove with a shining chest that holds a **Blood of the Iron Bull** , 1 **Small Piece of Gold** , and 4 **Tiny Piece of Gold**. 

![Wukong Tiger 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e5/Wukong_Tiger_3.jpg)

Keep heading up, and look left before reaching the top of the stairs. This time, you’ll find a **Meditation Spot** around the corner at the foot of a large tiger statue, and resting at it will award you a free Spark Skill Point.

Once you reach the top, you’ll come face to bloody face with the Tiger Vanguard, who looks like he just found his next meal. 

## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Tiger Vanguard

Compared to the slow and measured slams of the Stone Vanguard, the Tiger Vanguard is a relentless beast of a foe. You’ll need to be well prepared to take him down, and make sure you have the best armor and weapons crafted. If you haven’t been using them much before, now is also an excellent time to invest in crafting consumable medicines. Items like the Evil Repelling Medicament to reduce incoming damage, and the Tiger Subduing Pellets to increase your own. 

![Wukong Tiger 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ec/Wukong_Tiger_5.jpg)

Despite carrying a sword on his back, it’s the Tiger Vanguard’s fists you’ll need to worry about — at least for the start. He’ll use adapting martial arts moves with a mix of heavy punches, kicks, and slams that can come from any direction due to his agile movements. 

![Wukong Tiger 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/02/Wukong_Tiger_6.jpg)

Be ready for him to begin by quickly strafing to your side before launching into a flying punch. Moves like this will take him a moment to get up from the slam, giving you a good amount of time to start a light combo on him. 

He can also quickly employ two different two-punch strikes — one that you’ll want to punish, and other avoid. If he starts with an uppercut and downward fist slam, he’ll pause for a moment to shake off his fist from the force of the impact, which is your time to shine and lay into him. 

![Wukong Tiger 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/67/Wukong_Tiger_15.jpg)

However, if he starts with a right hook and then a delayed forward moving punch with his left, he’ll always follow up with a quick leg sweep as he bounds away to safety, making it an unwise move to try and counter, unless you’re playing things safe with a long-ranged jab from the Thrusting Stance. 

![Wukong Tiger 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/76/Wukong_Tiger_10.jpg)

Things can get even more dangerous when you see him assume a martial arts stance with one fist in front of him. Be ready for him to approach with a spinning kick that you’ll need to wait to dodge until the last moment. He’ll follow up with two quick punches, and then leap high into the air for a moment before twisting his body to come crashing down with a punching slam. He won’t shake this hand off, but you will at least have some room to fight back after he lands and slowly pulls his fist back up. 

![Wukong Tiger 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/95/Wukong_Tiger_11.jpg)

This leaping twisting fist slam attack can even come with little warning, as he’ll sometimes yell out while crouching before charging you and jumping into the move. 

He may also abandon his martial arts stance to quickly dive to the side, and then pounce on you to follow up with two quick downward punches, and a heavy stomp afterwards. Don’t expect much room to fight back during this one unless you can Immobilize or get a charged strike ready to knock him off-balance. 

![Wukong Tiger 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cb/Wukong_Tiger_7.jpg)

One major trick the Tiger Vanguard has up his sleeve is the power to turn to stone. He’ll try and bait you into this when spreading his arms wide or crouching down, but try not to take the bait, and use the time to heal, use consumables, or ready a Transformation. 

At the start, attacking him will prompt him to soak the blow and retaliate with a large punch when he comes out of his stone form. This time can be much better spent charging up your own heavy attack to hit him with the moment he comes out of the form and shakes off the dust. 

![Wukong Tiger 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/78/Wukong_Tiger_14.jpg)

Unfortunately, after the fight goes on for a bit, he won’t wait around to fool you. Whether you strike his stone form or not, he’ll use his own version of Cloud Step to race around the arena, and try to ambush you from a random angle. Watch for the signs of the blood splashing to anticipate where he’s coming from, and either let your stamina recharge to evade, or turn the tables on him with a Cloud Step of your own when he comes out of hiding. 

After the fight has raged for a bit and you may think you have a handle on this, you must still beware the Tiger Vanguard’s sword. He may deploy it sparingly, but when unsheathed it can deal a world of hurt and easily kill you before you’re able to find a time to heal. Knowing when that blade is coming is crucial to surviving the latter half of the fight. 

![Wukong Tiger 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/33/Wukong_Tiger_9.jpg)

The first instance is the easiest to spot, as he’ll assume a new stance putting two fingers in front of his face while his other hand rests on the handle of his sword. After a shout, he’ll unleash a single slashing attack that hits hard enough to launch its own projectile slash. Caught unaware, and it’ll easily take off more than half your health bar! It’s also the easiest one to punish, as he’ll usually take the time to put the blade back before starting his next attack, giving you a lot of time to strike back. 

![Wukong Tiger 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/05/Wukong_Tiger_8.jpg)

The other attack can come extremely quickly and unfortunately has a few variants. The most common one starts as the Tiger Vanguard approaches with a spin ending in a downward kick. As soon as he finishes his kick, he’ll seamlessly unsheathe his sword as he performs a downward swing to catch you off guard. This will be followed by a quick upward slash in the same direction, and then a large arcing spinning slash finale. 

![Wukong Tiger 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/79/Wukong_Tiger_16.jpg)

The last hit he’ll try to throw you off by spinning in place before the swing, so don’t be fooled! While there’s a chance he’ll perform a flourish and sheathe his sword after this, it’s more likely he’ll try to fool you again before starting up a second combo, which comes in three quick slashes with no delay at the end. 

If you try to retreat from the second combo, be warned that he can slice the bloody water to form waves of force as projectile slices with three hits, so you’ll need to keep dodging either way. 

![Wukong Tiger 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/31/Wukong_Tiger_18.jpg)

There’s also the chance he can start the sword combo while doing a spinning retreating jump, sneakily taking out the blade in a reverse grip in the process. He’ll retaliate with a quick reverse slash, before getting a proper grip on the blade for two more quick slices, and then begin the normal combo attack. 

![Wukong Tiger 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a5/Wukong_Tiger_17.jpg)

Finally, if you try to get too far away from him to rest and heal up, there’s a chance his single blade slash will instead create tornadoes of blood to seek you out! This only seems to happen when you stay at range from him, and he can follow these up with his other blood slashes to keep you from getting close. 

![Wukong Tiger 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/64/Wukong_Tiger_12.jpg)

This will be a tough fight no matter what you do, so the best thing you can do is to learn his moves, and which ones you can afford to hit back with a big charge attack. Certain times you may even be able to stagger him before he can perform a combo, or Immobilize him to shut him down from going on a sword-swinging spree — but if you don’t crash him out of it, he may just pick up where he left off. 

![Wukong Tiger 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c7/Wukong_Tiger_13.jpg)

Try using your Thrust stance to ensure your heavy hits give you some breathing room at range, especially if you’re not confident he’s done attacking when you try to get big hits off. Similarly, you may want to rely on quick-hitting Spirits. Since you don’t get a different health bar like the Transformation Spells, there’s a good chance you may be stuck attacking right into a sword slash unless you time your Spirit attack well. In fact, a well-timed Earth Wolf Spirit can knock him right out of an attack and stagger him against a wall! 

![Wukong Tiger 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/db/Wukong_Tiger_19.jpg)

While you can use the new Azure Dust transformation, there’s a good chance he’ll keep staggering you before you can get many moves off, so it might be better to match his nimbleness with the Red Tides spell, and find a good time to dodge and unleash your ultimate attack. 

![Wukong Tiger 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bc/Wukong_Tiger_20.jpg)

When at last the Tiger Vanguard is finally beaten by your attacks, he’ll turn to stone and crumble away. The headless musician will reappear, and return Sun Wukong’s legendary stone form back to the Destined One, giving you the **Rock Solid Spell**! This is your one big defensive parry, taking the place of Cloud Step to completely negate and incoming attack when timed right, and will stagger the enemy to open them up for attack. 

![Wukong Tiger 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/59/Wukong_Tiger_21.jpg)

Defeating the Tiger Vanguard will award you a Mind Core, and the Keeness of Tiger, the second Key Item needed along with the Sterness of Stone to finally open the big stone doors in this chapter that lead to the final boss. In fact, there’s one of those tallies in this very arena that can open up a secret path! 

Tiger Vanguard

![Wukong Tiger 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6b/Wukong_Tiger_22.jpg)

Using the Keeness of Tiger and Sterness of Stone, head up the steps to the large headless statue in the middle of the temple’s blood-soaked plaza. By activating this two-headed tally, you’ll drain the bloody pool, and reveal a large lion mouth that serves as a pit into the cellar below. 

## Temple Cellar

![Wukong Tiger 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6e/Wukong_Tiger_23.jpg)

Drop down into the mouth of the stone tiger, which leads to a very narrow tunnel passage inside the bowels of the temple. There are few Withered Corpses here to jump out at you from behind pots, but won’t be too much of a problem. 

![Wukong Tiger 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f5/Wukong_Tiger_24.jpg)

Once you’ve cleared the hall of Withered Corpses, look where the one hiding behind several large pots was, and you can find an altar with a gold pot. Open it, and you’ll receive a **Celestial Jade Lotus Pill** , massively improving your maximum health! 

Yellow Wind Ridge Celestial Jade Lotus Pill

Past the Celestial Pill, there will be a large pillar decoration, with a passage on the other side leading down to an open cave below the temple. 

![Wukong Tiger 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ea/Wukong_Tiger_25.jpg)

Here, you’ll find a large group of unique enemies not found elsewhere - Civet Sergeants. These small cat-like Yaoguai are armed with two swords apiece, and are led by an emboldened Civet Sergeant who boasts more health and attack, as he drops the Civet Sergeant Spirit when killed. 

![Wukong Tiger 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d6/Wukong_Tiger_26.jpg)

Due to their overwhelming numbers and ferocity of their relentless strikes, it can be hard to clear them out safely. This is a perfect place to unleash the Azure Dust Transformation to slam into them as a Rock Guai. The more they attack you on all sides with tiny blades, the faster you’ll charge your Might to unleash your big area of effect spell attack. 

Outside of your transformation, try to use Spirits who can attack multiple targets like the Earth Wolf’s charge, and consider using the Pillar Stance’s heavy attack to spin around on staff and attack the group as a whole. 

![Wukong Tiger 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Wukong_Tiger_28.jpg)

As you head up the stairs of the darkened cave, be sure to keep an eye on the right of the chamber for a long wooden chest that holds **Will** and 2 **Silk**. 

![Wukong Tiger 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/28/Wukong_Tiger_27.jpg)

When you finally find your way outside, look to the right to find a sloping sandy path leading down. There’s actually a ledge ahead in the ruined building with a chest, but getting it to can be the most aggravating experience unless you use a trick. 

![Wukong Tiger 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/31/Wukong_Tiger_29.jpg)

Ordinarily you’ll slip and slide on past, unable to do much or jump off to the sides. However, if you jump right before reaching the ledge, perform a heavy attack in mid-air, and you’ll do a small double jump before crashing down. Done correctly, you’ll get enough height to land right by the small turtle chest, which holds a **Tiger Relic** Soak for your Gourd! 

![Wukong Tiger 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2e/Wukong_Tiger_30.jpg)

Slide down the rest of the way, and you’ll come up to a Shrine for the Crouching Tiger Temple’s Cellar. In the far corner of the cellar, you’ll find a familiar friendly face - the Xu Dog you helped get medicine recipes for! 

Talk to him while he’s in front of his large furnace, and the Xu Dog will thank you for your help thus far with a Mind Core. He'll also teach you the art of crafting your own Celestial Medicines in addition to the Mortal Medicine consumables you’ve been creating. 

![Wukong Tiger 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ec/Wukong_Tiger_31.jpg)

Celestial Medicines are sort of like passive buffs you can apply by trading in Mind Cores, which can be found in a variety of places - both by defeating bosses and sometimes regular enemies, or in chests. The buffs range from the familiar ones like health/stamina/mana increases much like the Celestial Pills, but also other stats like Crit Chance or resistance to certain afflictions. 

The best part of these new passive buffs is that you have the option to reset them like your Skill Tree, which will give you back all the Mind Cores you’ve used thus far, allowing you to come back and reallocate points to suit your needs. 

Before heading out, be sure to also buy the **Longevity Decoction** formula for 2,700 Will. It will allow you to craft a consumable that temporarily raises max health, allowing you to survive a bit longer in deadly boss fights. 

Down past the Shrine, you’ll finally find the way down to the final boss of Chapter 2. However, there’s a lot more to the Yellow Wind Formation sub-region than just the boss, including the path beyond the Crouching Tiger Temple, and the other doors yet to be unlocked. Our next stop will be to explore a large optional part of the **Yellow Wind Formation** above at the Windrest Bridge.
