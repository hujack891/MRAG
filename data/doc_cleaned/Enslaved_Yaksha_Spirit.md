## Enslaved Yaksha Location

The Enslaved Yaksha requires you to complete a secret side quest before you can reach him. To begin, you will have to make your way to the Pagoda Realm. Work your way up the Pagoda until you reach the Upper Pagoda Keeper's Shrine. Once you reach the Shrine, turn 180 degrees to face the cliffs. Walk to the edge and look down to see a boss arena containing Captain Lotus-Vision.

Defeat the boss to unlock the purple seals preventing you from entering all of the jail cells in the Pagoda. The Enslaved Yaksha is locked inside one of these cells. 

Follow our guide on how to remove the purple seals from the Pagoda cells if you're having trouble finding the boss! 

## Enslaved Yaksha Fight

The Enslaved Yaksha is armed with a massive metal spike, and he's not afraid to use it. The sheer size of the spike means the Enslaved Yaksha has a lot of reach. Use Immobilize to freeze him in place so you can wail on him safely and watch out for the other enemies that lurk in the cell with him.

  * **Mutilate**
  * Equipped Effect: Grants a moderate amount of Focus when hit. 

The Enslaved Yaksha's Spirit Power allows you to take his form and stab your enemy with the long spike he wields. This deals initial impact damage while also staggering the enemy so you can land another combo before they get up. The equipped effect allows you build Focus when you take damage, so getting hit doesn't sting quite so bad.
