# Gourds

Gourds are your main source of health regeneration in Black Myth: Wukong. They can be used several times each life to restore a chunk of your health, alongside some other buffs for a brief period, as you upgrade each Gourd. 

They are pretty rare, and there are only a few different ones hidden throughout the game’s chapters, so you will need to keep an eye out to get them all or find the best Gourd to use. 

Below you can find a breakdown of each Gourd in the game, where they are located, and the buffs they offer. Over time each link will take you to a dedicated page on where to find the Gourds. You can also use our Walkthrough. Additionally, you can check each one off as you find them.
