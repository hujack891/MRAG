## Wolf Assassin Location

The Wolf Assassin is located in Chapter 1 and can be quite tricky to find. Locating him is much easier after collecting the upgrade that allows you to identify Spirits. You can find the Wolf Assassin on the way up to Bodhi Peak after exiting the cave. Head up the path a little until you reach a large wooden platform. There is a small plank of wood on the left leading to a secret area.

## Wolf Assassin Fight

The Wolf Assassin isn't a boss by any means, so the fight won't give you as much trouble as Wandering Wight or some other big Spirit battles. The Wolf Assassin fights like many of the other wolves you will face on Black Wind Mountain - with knives. The Wolf Assassin can throw them, so make sure you keep your eyes peeled for any long-range attacks.

  * Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Critical Hit Chance. 

The Wolf Assassin Spirit allows you to take the form of the Wolf and throw out knives towards your foes. The knives return back to you like a boomerang, damaging anything in their path. The Wolf Assassin also increases your Critical Hit chance. This can be empowered even further in the skill tree to create a formidable combination.
