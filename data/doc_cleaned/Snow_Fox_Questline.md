# Snow Fox Questline

The Snow Fox is a character you can encounter in Chapter 3 of Black Myth: Wukong. Completing her side quest will unlock a secret boss for you to take on and a unique Curio. 

## Where to Find the Snow Fox

To meet the fox, progress through Chapter 3 until you get to the Valley of Ectascy section, which is toward the end. You'll eventually slide down a snowy slope, and arrive at the Forest of Felicity. To the left of the Forest of Felicity Keeper's Shrine, you'll see a skeletal body slumped against a post at the start of a wooden path.

Approach the body and interact with it, to learn about the fox guai whose soul resides in it. You'll need to keep prompting the fox to talk throughout this interaction, to learn the entire story of the fox being caught in a hunter's trap and rescued by a young scholar. Despite the fox trying to thank the scholar by helping him, the scholar ended up taking the fox's life. With revenge in mind, the fox has managed to track down the scholar, who is now a monk in the New Thunderclap Temple â€“ a place you'll conveniently be visiting soon.

When the story is over, examine the body and the fox will beg you to transform and wear the fur so you can confront the monk. After this, you'll automatically become the fox, and receive a Snow Fox Brush special item. 

### Returning to Fox Form

Much like previous transformations, if you're in this state and are hit, you'll automatically return back to your original form. The difference with this instance, however, is that you can rest at a Keeper's Shrine and then use the Snow Fox Brush from your inventory to return to fox form.

Although you're automatically thrown into the fox form, we'd recommend **not worrying about it until you are ready to explore the New Thunderclap Temple.** To get there, you'll need to follow the wooden paths behind the body and turn right when you see the stone figures. 

Keep following this snowy path through the archways. You'll go past a red one with torches, where you'll take the path around to the left and end up at the Longevity Road Keeper's Shrine. 

![Snow Fox Questline \(9\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/06/Snow_Fox_Questline_%289%29.png)

From here, you'll go through the arch behind it and take a right. Head up the stairs and you'll be at the start of the New Thunderclap Temple.

If it's your first time visiting, you'll have a boss to deal with before you can enter. But after this, you can go and activate the Temple Entrance Keeper's Shrine. Go right from the shrine and down to the building up ahead. 

![Snow Fox Questline \(10\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1f/Snow_Fox_Questline_%2810%29.png)

Head through to the other side, where you'll see two sets of stairs. Take the ones on the left, and go up. 

![Snow Fox Questline \(12\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/50/Snow_Fox_Questline_%2812%29.png)

When you get to the top, turn right and look for the stairs on the left just up ahead. Go down these and straight across into the building. 

![Snow Fox Questline \(14\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/57/Snow_Fox_Questline_%2814%29.png)

As you head inside, **stick to the right side of the building and then go up the then go up the stairs**. This will bring you to the top of the building, where you'll want to go outside using the door on the left. When you're on the balcony, go right, and then right again to find a wooden bridge. 

![Snow Fox Questline \(13\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/17/Snow_Fox_Questline_%2813%29.png)

Go up the sloped wooden bridge, and straight up the stairs to the left. This will bring you to the temple where the monk is. However, **this is also when you'll need to be in fox form**. Doing so will activate a cutscene and trigger a boss fight against the Yaoguai Chief Non-Void. Transform into the fox by using the Snow Fox Brush from your inventory, then step inside the temple. 

### Yaoguai Chief Boss - Non-Void

![Snow Fox Questline \(16\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a1/Snow_Fox_Questline_%2816%29.png)

During this fight, you'll see Non-Void disappear intermittently either as a reflexive dodging move to counter your attacks, or in between his own attacks. He'll often throw punches or kicks, and quickly spin away becoming almost invisible and putting distance between the two of you. On top of this, he can become completely invisible and dash across to the other side of the room. 

![Snow Fox Questline \(69\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d9/Snow_Fox_Questline_%2869%29.png)

To counter this, you want to get him to stay still as often as possible. So for this fight, you'll need to be quite aggressive to try and interrupt the flow of his attacks and keep him stunned for as long as you can. 

![Snow Fox Questline \(23\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/13/Snow_Fox_Questline_%2823%29.png)

Use Spirits that can deliver heavy hits like Wandering Wight. If you can land the head-smashing Faithful Kowtow move on him, you can knock him completely over. This will stagger him for a moment, giving you the chance to move in quickly to follow up with combos. 

Team this spells like a Pluck of Many to overwhelm him, and transformations. Azure Dust is good if you can keep him pinned, so you can continue with the heavy attacks and build Might for a finisher while doing so. Alternatively, Red Tides works due to the quick nature of the attacks, and the ability to inflict burn damage. 

![Snow Fox Questline \(57\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/49/Snow_Fox_Questline_%2857%29.png)

If you're having a hard time finding the right moment to attack, try getting him to stand still as often as possible by using Immobilize. We'd also recommend having Cloud Step equipped for this fight so you can match his dashing ability. Using Cloud Step will allow you to gain the upper hand on him at times and surprise him. 

![Snow Fox Questline \(64\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3a/Snow_Fox_Questline_%2864%29.png)

The biggest attack he performs is one where he whips up a load of papers into a tornado that will follow you around the temple. You can dodge this or run away from it, but he'll use it as cover at times to get closer to you. Toward the end of this move, the papers will start to fall and there's an opening where he doesn't move much at all. This is the perfect moment to Immobolize him or dash over to attack as much as you can. 

Any chance you get where you're able to make him stagger backward, keep attacking. When he appears to be losing his balance, he'll be slower to get back into his pattern of attacks and you can keep finishing combos and use your Focus points for heavier attacks. 

![Snow Fox Questline \(65\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/67/Snow_Fox_Questline_%2865%29.png)

When he's down, you'll earn 1x Tonifying Decoction, 2x Cold Iron Leaves, Blood of the Iron Bull, 1,201 Will, and you'll be able to absorb the spirit of Non-Void. 

## How to Complete the Snox Fox Mission

When you've beaten Non-Void, return to the fox guai near the Forest of Felicity Keeper's Shrine. Examine the body and the spirit of the fox can finally be free. By completing the mission, you'll earn the Snow Fox Brush Curio.
