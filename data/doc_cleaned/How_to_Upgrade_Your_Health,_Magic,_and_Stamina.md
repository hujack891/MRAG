The first way to upgrade your Health, Magic, and Stamina levels is to unlock skills. Open the Self-Advancement sub-menu from the main menu. 

Once you're here, you can use the Foundation tab to upgrade your Health, Stamina, and Mana. Look for the Survival category, and you'll see the top two icons are for increasing your Health and Stamina.**Robust Constitution increases your health, while Rampant Vigor will boost your Stamina**. You can upgrade these both 6 times to give you an extra boost. 

When you reach **Level 30, you'll also unlock Spiritual Awakening** under the Survival category, which will increase your Maximum Mana.

In Chapter 2 of Black Myth: Wukong, you can explore the Crouching Tiger Temple. You can even enter the Crouching Tiger Temple Cellar if you use the Sterness of Stone and Keeness of Tiger Key Items to unlock it. 

You can collect the Sterness of Stone from the Stone Vanguard near Rockrest Flat and the Keeness of Tiger from the Tiger Vanguard in the Crouching Tiger Temple.

Head down into the Cellar, until you reach the sand where you'll automatically start to slide down. Just off to the right, you'll see a fire burning and a Keeper's Shrine. Here, you can find Xu Dog by the fire.
