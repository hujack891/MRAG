As an optional character you can meet, the Man-in-Stone can easily be missed, but shouldn't if you want to unlock an important spell. He's located in a small crevice of the Fright Cliff, found by heading to the right of the Squall Hideout below a large ruin.

In order to fight him, you'll first need to complete his questline by defeating the Mother of Stones found in a large cave tunnel to the left, and return the Stone Essence to him. He'll then mock you for being gullible enough to give him the stone, and you'll then be able to fight him for the prize.

While he technically has a boss health bar and everything, he’s kind of a pushover, barely having much more health than a regular Pinstone, and only doing their regular attacks anyway. Simply Immobilize him, rack up some Focus Points, and deliver a charged strike to send him packing.

Realizing the error of his ways, the Man-in-Stone will promptly burrow right back in the ground and plead for mercy. You’ll then be able to re-harvest the Stone Essence from him, which will turn into the **Azure Dust Transformation Spell**! Finally, the slow yet sturdy power of the Rock Guai is yours to command in battle!
