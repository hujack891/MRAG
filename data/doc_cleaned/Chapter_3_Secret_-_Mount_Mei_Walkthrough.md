# Chapter 3 Secret - Mount Mei Walkthrough

Mount Mei is the secret area in Chapter 3 - White Snow, Ice Cold of Black Myth: Wukong. However, you'll only be able to access it in Chapter 5 after completing all the secret areas in the game. We'd recommend waiting until you've finished Chapter 6 of the game and beat it before you visit Mount Mei, due to it being a vital place to see for the secret ending of the game.

## How to Enter Mount Mei from The Great Pagoda

![Mount Mei Walkthrough .png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c0/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_.png)

When you’re in The Great Pagoda, you’ll see tapestries around the room. One tapestry, at the very top of the room, will be red. Head for this, and a cutscene will begin where the small Buddha from Chapter 3 will be waiting for you. He'll open the tapestry and let you into Mount Mei. 

## Mount Mei

When you're through the tapestry, head up the stairs and follow the path. About halfway up you'll need to shimmy across a ledge on the left to reach the other side, then you'll continue up to the Mei-Jian Peak Keeper's Shrine. 

## Mei-Jian Peak

Here is where you'll need to get your gear together before you go up to the tip of the mountain, where you'll be entering a boss battle against a familiar face. 

### Erlang, The Sacred Divinity

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(1\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b8/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%281%29.png)

As you reach the peak of the mountain, you'll see a black dog. It will run toward the building at the top of the peak and soon join Erlang, The Sacred Divinity, who you fought at the very beginning of the game. This time, however, it's a bigger challenge. 

Erlang is undoubtedly one of the toughest bosses in the game. To make it harder, he has a health bar and a shield bar, and you'll need to deplete his shield to do maximum damage. There is a quick way to knock this down, however, and that's to use the Plantain Fan. Each time you're able to throw this out, it will get his shield gone in a few seconds. You can then make the most of his vulnerable state, by following up with heavy attacks. 

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(5\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/17/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%285%29.png)

You can opt for a build where you try to use spells against Erlang, but he's pretty good at countering them all. For example, if you use a Transformation, he will transform as well, and sometimes will just remove your Transformation entirely. If you are going for spells, Immobilize is good but only when you've knocked his shield down. Be mindful that he can use it against you as well. Cloudstep also is useful to evade the more dangerous attacks and sneak up on him. If you do go with Spells, you'll want to get your Plantain Fan back as quickly as possible to keep knocking down his shield.   
  
However, we'd actually recommend using Spellbinder (fully upgraded), which you'll have picked up from the Treasure Hunter/Green-Capped Martialist side quest in Chapter 3. Equip medicines like the Loong Aura Amplication Pellets and Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets to make the most out of your Attacks and Critical Hit chances. It's also worth using Ginseng Pellets to help you with Focus recovery, and if you're finding it very hard, you might want to take the Soul Remigration Pill, which will resurrect you if you die. 

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(10\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b0/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%2810%29.png)

There are four stages to this fight. You can knock his health down by 25% quickly, by using the Plantain Fan as soon as you enter the fight. Either use Immobilize immediately here if you're going for Spells or throw out Spellbinder.   
  
You'll want to run about halfway across the field before you throw out the Plantain Fan, but if he goes to perform his attack, it's best to dodge this and then use the fan. Once you've knocked the first shield down, use Spellbinder and go in for the attack. 

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(7\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f6/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%287%29.png)

When the second stage begins, he'll fly up in the air and a giant axe will appear. This will swing and eventually crash down but can be dodged quite easily. The attack doesn't end here, however, as Erlang quickly follows up with his own attack to try and catch you off guard. This will send out a ripple that looks like ice, that you'll need to roll over or jump to avoid. 

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(6\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%286%29.png)

From this phase onward, you will have to deal with lighting from Erlang, so Shock-Quelling Powder and resistance to shock attacks are a huge help here. 

The second stage is a series of combo attacks, where he'll use his staff and swap between a small version of the axe or a sword. When he has the sword, you can expect projectiles to follow. These can be blocked by spinning your sword or dodging. 

The problem with this stage is getting the timings right, as his attacks can often seem delayed from when they feel like they should end. If you're using Spells, do not try to use Immobilize until his shield is down again. You'll want to keep hitting him and use Cloudstep to build up your Focus, then whittle his shield down or use the Plantain Fan to do it, if you can get it back quickly. All other Spells aren't worth wasting your Mana on. 

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(4\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d2/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%284%29.png)

When his shield is down again, follow up with heavy attacks, and Immobilize if you're using Spells. He'll quickly reach 50% health and go up in the air again. 

This time, he'll shoot a laser beam from his forehead toward you, and duplicates will appear one after the other, pointing beams at you. You can dodge these to build up focus and avoid their attacks. 

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(11\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/47/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%2811%29.png)

However, when he brings his duplicates back together, he will be surrounded by swirling spears. This is when the attacks start to get far more dangerous. You'll see pulses of red flashing as well as lightning as the spears spin faster and faster. The projectiles can be reflected, but it's the end of this attack that causes the greatest damage. 

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(3\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%283%29.png)

This attack ends in a red, charged attack, which can be hard to dodge. Unfortunately, unless you're running Cloudstep, all you can do is learn the timings to run or dodge to escape these attacks. You can deflect the spears until he charges up to perform the full attack, but as soon as your staff stops spinning, start dodging. He'll hang for a moment once he's fully charged, and then dart toward you, but again, this is a move that seems like it has a delayed reaction. 

On top of this, you'll start to see him dragging the long sword toward you quickly. Again, this requires fast dodging to avoid it colliding with you. The third time he does this, he will start to shoot lasers, and you'll need to dodge around 4 times to completely miss the attack. 

As you enter into the last 25% of his health bar, you can approach the fight in the same way. Just focus on knocking his shield down one last time and following up with your heavy attacks, Immobilize, and if you have enough Mana, now is a good time to throw out Pluck of Many. 

When his health bar is depleted, Erlang will turn into a bird and fly off. The Destined One will follow, and you'll soon be clashing in the sky. 

Erlang, the Sacred Divinity

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(12\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f5/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%2812%29.png)

After crash landing back on Mount Mei, two giants will emerge. This is the Destined One's Stone Monkey form and Erlang Shen. When Erlang is thrown off into the distance, you'll be thrown into a fight against the Four Heavenly Kings. 

### The Four Heavenly Kings

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(15\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/76/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%2815%29.png)

Thankfully after a huge battle against Erlang, The Sacred Divinity, the fight against the Four Heavenly Kings is much more straightforward. They share one health bar between them, and in your Stone Monkey transformation, you can use Primal Punch as your light attack, Earthshatter Slam as your heavy attack (this attack also heals), and Rock Solid to deflect their hits. 

Use Rock Solid when it's available and when one of the four giants will launch themselves at you. Other than that, you'll just want to keep using Primal Punch to build up Focus. When you've built your points, use Earthshatter Slam. 

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(14\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2b/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%2814%29.png)

About halfway through the fight, you'll also be able to start using Ice Bath. When you use the Ice Bath Spell, the Stone Monkey's arms will be covered in frost, and when you punch, you'll inflict frost damage. 

The Four Heavenly Kings

When the Four Heavenly Kings have been taken down, there's just one more giant to deal with, which is Erlang Shen. 

### Erlang Shen

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(13\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/16/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%2813%29.png)

You should similarly approach the fight to the Four Heavenly Kings, and use Primal Punch to build up your Focus. When it's built up, use Earthshatter Slam to replenish your health and perform a heavy attack, and keep Rock Solid for moments when you can deflect Erlang Shen's blade attack. 

When Erlang Shen's health reaches around 70%, he'll imbue his sword with fire, and start to use it as a whip. This will make the fight a bit tougher, but you'll replenish your health whenever you use Eartshatter Slam. Be sure to use Ice Bath to counter these fire attacks. 

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(16\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8c/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%2816%29.png)

Around the halfway mark, Erlang Shen will grab you and breath fire on you. Your health bar will drain all the way down, but you won't die. instead, you'll switch to Fiery Fist and be able to perform Scorch Shower instead of Icy Fists. Your health bar will slowly replenish after this, and the second part of the fight will begin. 

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(18\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0b/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%2818%29.png)

Just keep pummelling away at Erlang Shen and making use of all the Spells until he's defeated. 

Erlang Shen

![Mount Mei Walkthrough \(17\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fc/Mount_Mei_Walkthrough_%2817%29.png)

At the end of the fight, a cutscene will begin and Erlang and the Destined One will return to their previous forms. You'll hear a barrage of voices while the wind spins around you, and you'll be transported out of Mount Mei. 

A cutscene shows the Old Man and the small Buddha talking outside of the tapestries, and you'll return to The Great Pagoda. Finishing this secret area in Chapter 3 will earn you the Azure Dome Transformation, where you can transform into the Stone Monkey. 

Now that you've defeated Erlang and the Four Heavenly Kings, you'll be able to see the secret ending of the game. To see the secret (true) ending, complete Chapter 6 as normal and defeat the final bosses to watch it play out. 

Mount Mei Complete
