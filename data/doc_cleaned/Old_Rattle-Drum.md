# Old Rattle-Drum

The Old Rattle-Drum is one of the more well-hidden Key Items in Black Myth: Wukong. However, it is one of the more important optional ones, as it unlocks a secret area, a hidden boss, and one of the Gourds in the game.

You will have to venture off to find it, and figuring out where to use it is even harder. But, below, you can find details on its location and the three spots in the game where you can shake it, to unlock the secret area. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Old Rattle-Drum Location

The Old Rattle-Drum is located on the bridge at the end of the Windrest Hamlet in Yellow Wind Formation in Yellow Wind Ridge. It is given to you after defeating the Tiger Acolyte on the bridge. 

To get to the bridge with the Tiger Acolyte, you simply need to head across the rope bridge at the Sandgate Village - Valley of Despair shrine. It is next to the big locked gate. Continue through the initial area until you reach the Windrest Hamlet Shrine. Kill the enemies on the initial bridge into the hamlet and head down towards the next bridge.

The Old-Rattle Drum can be used in the following spots: 

  * The area just before the Windrest Hamlet Shrine
