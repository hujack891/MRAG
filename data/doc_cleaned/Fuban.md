# Fuban

Fuban is a secret optional Yaoguai King boss fight that you can encounter in Chapter 2's secret area in Black Myth Wukong. Located in the Kingdom of Sahali locked away in the past, you'll need to help fulfill a drunken Boar's quest to access this area. 

  * **Rewards:** Wind Tamer, Sky-Piercing Horn

## Where to Find Fuban

The Kingdom of Sahali is a Chapter 2 Secret area that can only be accessed by meeting the Yellow-Robed Square in Fright Cliff (aka the Drunken Boar), and helping him in his search for the "Realm of Gold" which requires a few steps (and for you to best him in combat).

In order to unlock this secret area, you need to find the Drunk Boar (the Yellow-Robed Squire) who can be found in the Rockrest Flat part of the Fright Cliff region in Chapter 2. Head straight to the back of the area from the shrine to find a small breakable wooden fence protected by a Spearbone enemy.

In this large open field, you’ll find a friendly boar-like Guai resting on a rock. He’s apparently extremely inebriated, and needs you to help him find something to sober him up. He’ll mention “Windrest” if you talk to him again, providing a clue to where you can find such an ingredient. 

There are two ways to get the item required: 

![Wukong Fright 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Wukong_Fright_34.jpg)

  * If you complete the Man-in-Stone’s questline, you’ll find that the Man-in-Stone sells a **Sobering Stone** if you don’t want to explore.

![Wukong Yellow 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/13/Wukong_Yellow_10.jpg)

  * To locate the stone itself, you’ll need to head through the Yellow Wind Formation to the Windrest Hamlet, which is across the Windrest Bridge up the road past the Crouching Tiger Temple. Once you enter the hamlet, take a left to find a large building guarded by a Rat Soldier and Rat Imperial Guard. On the left side when looking at the large building, defeat a Blazebone monster, and then look to the right for a small alcove, where you can spot a glowing pot. Break the pot, and you’ll find the **Sobering Stone**.

![Wukong Yellow 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/55/Wukong_Yellow_33.jpg)

When you return it to the Drunken Boar, he’ll thank you, and declare that he’s now off in search of a meaty meal. He doesn’t actually want you to get some for him, and will set off himself to the Crouching Tiger Temple. 

![Wukong Yellow 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4f/Wukong_Yellow_34.jpg)

At the temple entrance, start to head up the stairs, and then turn right before the top — opposite where the Meditation Spot is. You’ll find the Boar resting against a far wall under one of the giant tiger sculptures.He’ll complain of the poor meat quality, and instead ask that you bring him a **Jade Lotus**. If you don’t already have plenty gathered, you’ll find Jade Lotus to harvest in most ponds and bodies of water, like the one right at the start of the chapter. 

![Wukong Yellow 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Wukong_Yellow_35.jpg)

When you give the Boar the Jade Lotus, he’ll relay some interesting information about a “Realm of Gold” that he’s seeking, and will leave the temple. 

![Wukong Sandgate 71.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/94/Wukong_Sandgate_71.jpg)

This “senior brother” is the First Prince of Flowing Sand — aka the giant rat Yaoguai Chief that you can fight in the Valley of Despair on the road from Sandgate Village to the Crouching Tiger Temple. If you didn’t kill the rat king, he’ll summon the prince to fight you. Otherwise, you can use the Pungent Flesh Chunk to summon and defeat him yourself. He’ll drop the Arhat Gold Piece when defeated, which is the gold the Boar needs. 

![Wukong Sahali 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ae/Wukong_Sahali_1.jpg)

The Boar will actually return to near where you first met him at the Rockrest Flat area of the Fright Cliff. However, instead of sitting on a rock, he’ll now be standing over by the stairs leading to a large door you can’t access yet. 

Unfortunately, he’s not too pleased that you’re in possession of the gold, and will challenge you to a duel. Upon defeat, he’ll relent and offer to let you join him in exploring the Realm of Gold together, before vanishing off behind the giant gate up the stairs. 

![Wukong Sahali 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Wukong_Sahali_10.jpg)

Once you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into the Kingdom of Sahali. 

After besting the "Tiger Vanguard", you'll find none other than the Yellow Rat Sage, who needs your help defeating a giant scarab Guai in the sands below. 

## Fuban Boss Fight and Guide

![Wukong Sahali 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/43/Wukong_Sahali_27.jpg)

Once you make your way down either of the slopes into the large sandy dunes where the giant Scarab Yaoguai called Fuban has emerged, you’ll be in for a battle against a juggernaut of a scarab beetle. 

Don’t let its imposing size scare you too much - this battle isn’t as hard as many others in Chapter 2 despite being a secret boss, as long as you know when and where to attack. 

Fuban will likely begin by burrowing into the ground and vanishing, and the Yellow Wind Sage will call out to watch for the sands rumbling to tell where Fuban is approaching from. 

![Wukong Sahali 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/65/Wukong_Sahali_28.jpg)

He’ll then leap high into the air and try to crash down on you, which can be a bit confusing due to the camera angle, but you’ll need to dodge just before he crashes down (or use your Rock Solid, though it won’t stagger this boss). 

![Wukong Sahali 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c0/Wukong_Sahali_29.jpg)

After he lands, you’ll be instructed to strike at its claws, so move yourself to the side and lock onto one of the front claws of the beast. Fuban won’t move around too much during this period, but may shake its head around requiring you to dodge a few slams. 

![Wukong Sahali 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/15/Wukong_Sahali_30.jpg)

Fuban can also slowly pull one of its claws back to then sweep upward in front of his face, which can damage you if you aren’t paying attention. If you’re worried about getting hit, you can also play it safe and stick with the Thrust Stance to hit its claws with a long range heavy attack. 

![Wukong Sahali 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/ca/Wukong_Sahali_32.jpg)

Other attacks can include swipes with both hands that sweep side to side, so even if one hand swipes past, don’t get too confident in thinking the danger has passed in case another claw on the other side sweeps your way. 

![Wukong Sahali 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/17/Wukong_Sahali_31.jpg)

Fuban can also rear back on its hind legs before slamming down to create a large shockwave, and will require a well-timed dodge, or you can turn into stone form to soak the blow. 

![Wukong Sahali 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9a/Wukong_Sahali_33.jpg)

Be wary if you see Fuban start to pivot and turn away from you. It will duck down and show you the giant vessel attached to its carapace — a huge stone head — and then promptly ram it into you. This is a tough attack to dodge neatly if you aren’t expecting it, and will deal a ton of damage if it lands. 

![Wukong Sahali 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e6/Wukong_Sahali_34.jpg)

Once you’ve taken off around a third of its health, Fuban will back up and burrow back into the ground. Once again, it will start to swim through the sand at you, which your lock on will thankfully stick to. 

![Wukong Sahali 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/63/Wukong_Sahali_35.jpg)

This time, Fuban will swim right under you, and pierce upward with its horn to try and skewer you. The good news is that by using your Pillar Stance, you can raise up away from the explosion, and will only lose a chunk of stamina as the sand erupts, while avoiding damage. 

![Wukong Sahali 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/96/Wukong_Sahali_36.jpg)

However, this won’t end Fuban’s underground reign of terror, as he’ll keep moving his horn up and down from below the sands to attack twice as his horn moves up and down, so keep dodging to stay out of the way. 

![Wukong Sahali 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/92/Wukong_Sahali_37.jpg)

Once Fuban starts another charge, he’ll repeat doing several leap attacks in a row that you’ll need to keep avoiding. Luckily, the Yellow Wind Sage will put an end to this by banging the drums more to stun Fuban entirely. 

![Wukong Sahali 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f2/Wukong_Sahali_38.jpg)

At this point, the battle will be paused and Fuban stunned, allowing you to climb up via its head to reach the large statue on its back. Jump onto the statue head, and look for a glowing eye to examine. You’ll then retrieve the Vessel that gives Fuban much of its power to fend off the yellow rat, who can now join you for the rest of the battle! 

![Wukong Sahali 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/92/Wukong_Sahali_39.jpg)

In this second phase, things will get even easier thanks to the Yellow Wind Sage on your side. You’ll be able to let him to the main talking. He can deal incredible damage with his wind attacks, which you can supplement by continuing the assault on his claws.You’ll still need to be mindful of his charge attacks and claw swipes, but you’re given more room to hang back and heal while the rat takes the brunt of his aggression. 

![Wukong Sahali 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1e/Wukong_Sahali_40.jpg)

By dealing enough damage, the Yellow Wind Sage can also knock Fuban to the ground. Be wary when approaching at first, if you see Fuban start to thrash left and right, it’s better to hang back, and wait until the rat can follow up with another powerful attack to stun Fuban until he lies on his side. 

![Wukong Sahali 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5b/Wukong_Sahali_41.jpg)

That’s your cue to rush in and hit Fuban’s exposed area with your biggest hits, using charged strikes, Spirit Attacks, and Transformation Spells to unload on the beetle before he can rise up. 

When following this strategy, you’ll quickly burn through the rest of Fuban’s health bar, and between you and the Yellow Wind Sage, the beetle will stand little chance. He can still repeatedly slam his head in the ground to create shockwaves, and finally pull up with a massive explosion. Again, the Pillar Stance can be useful for dodging these blasts, so long as you have a bit of distance away from him too. 

![Wukong Sahali 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5b/Wukong_Sahali_43.jpg)

When he’s finally out of health, the battle will be won, and the Yellow Wind Sage will valiantly land the final blow. It’s a shame we’ll have to beat him up in the future. For your part in the battle, you’ll earn a Sky-Piercing Horn weapon material, and a new Vessel: The Wind Tamer!
