## Flint Vanguard Location

Once you've completed the Iron Ball challenge in the Flaming Mountains and unlocked the Fallen Furnace Crater Keeper's Shrine, head back down the hill and take the newly opened passage on the left. Follow the path until you find a pile of glowing rocks lying in a large clearing. Approach the rocks to awaken the Flint Vanguard.

## Flint Vanguard Fight

The Flint Vanguard is a lava-rock copy of the Stone Vanguard you face in Yellow Wind Ridge. He has all the same attacks, but the battle is further complicated by his fire abilities and the horde of enemies that join the fight as well. 

The Flint Vanguard is protected by a significant amount of Searing Fire and Scorching Fire enemies. These enemies make it extremely easy to get overwhelmed in this fight. A Pluck of Many can help you clear out some of the minions so you can focus on the Flint Vanguard itself. 

The best way to fight this foe is by sticking behind it. The Flint Vanguard punches into the ground with its fists and has a sweeping attack that reaches either side of the beast, but both can be avoided by staying directly behind the creature.

The Flint Vanguard's Spirit allows you to take the form of the rocky beast and beat your great fists into the ground, inflicting Scorch Bane and dealing Burn Damage to any enemies caught in the blasts.
