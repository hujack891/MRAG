## Snake Herbalist Location

The Snake Herbalist is in the secret area in Chapter 4 called Purple Cloud Mountain. To reach this area, you must first defeat the Venom Daoist in the chamber to the right of the Pool of Shattered Jade Keeper's Shrine. From there, revisit him again in an empty room on a path branching off to the right of the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Defeat him to unlock the secret area. 

Once you're at Purple Cloud Mountain, head down the path, past the snake, and over the bridge. Turn left and run up the hill to find the Snake Herbalist.

## Snake Herbalist Fight

The Snake Herbalist fights like all other enemies of its type. Its main weapons are a sharp spear and its long neck that it can use to strike you at very high speeds. The Snake Herbalist pulls its neck all the way back before launching this attack, giving you a visual indication of when to dodge. 

The Snake Herbalist has a basket full of poison on its back as well, so keep an eye on your status effects during this fight. Take some Antimiasma Powder when necessary.

  * Equipped Effect: Recovers a small amount of Health when taking Medicines. 

The Snake Herbalist's Spirit allows you to take the form of the Snake and launch a volley of poison from the basket on its back. This poison pools on the ground and inflicts enemies with Poison Bane if they step into it. Thankfully, these pools don't damage you, so you don't have to worry about watching your step after launching the attack. 

The equipped effect replenishes Health when you take any sort of Medicine, which can be handy in the Webbed Hollow and other places where you are likely to get status afflictions.
