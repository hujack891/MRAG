## Where to Find the Elder Amourworm

The Elder Amourworm is an optional encounter that you can seek out while exploring the massive Webbed Hollow Portion of Chapter 4. After descending down to the Vedure Bridge Shrine, head right and cross the nearby bridge, staying to the left to find an archway with two lanterns who seem to be chattering "Big day!". 

After meeting a suspicious ally who will tell you of treasure nearby, head through the gate to find several treasure chests, and an exit onto a cliff filled with cocoons where the Elder Amourworm sits. 

## Elder Amourworm Boss Fight and Guide

While not a particularly challenging fight, the Elder Amourworm is a hefty foe that makes up for its lack of abilities with a few dirty tricks you'll need to be ready for, and also be stocked up on Antimiasma Medicine.

The Elder Amourworm sports a large creepy mask that you can see when it rears up, and it will use it to shoot out sticky threads in frontal arc. If you get caught, you'll have to mash to get out before being charged and attacked while unable to defend yourself.

If the sticky webs weren't bad enough, its other main trick is the ability to shoot out globs of poison, that will stay on the ground for a short duration even if it misses you. The Elder Amourworm can shoot out these poison globs when facing you, but also when you try to attack from its back, making it dangerous no matter which direction you fight from.

Even when knocked down, it can behave erratically, wriggling and slamming down to splash out more poison from its sides before getting back up, which can sometimes limit where you can press your attack.

Beyond this, most of its attacks will come in the form of simply using its weight to thrash about. You'll usually be able to see it coming when the worm twists around to prepare to swing its body toward you -- but a deflection using Rock Solid can stop the worm in its tracks.

It can also perform a surprising leap into the air to crash down on you, which is thankfully slow enough that you'll be able to dodge around to the side when it lands.

If you find yourself having trouble avoiding getting poisoned, consider using the Pillar Stance to boost yourself up off the ground.

Otherwise, you can also try keeping your distance and strafing during initial poison volleys, and then rush back in so you don't have to dance around poison when getting close. 

When the Amourworm is defeated, you'll gain a Proto-Amourworm Key Item. It may seem mysterious, but it does have a use. Bring it to Chen Loong at the Zodiac Village, and then return later to find the tiny Amourworm in a little basket outside his shack. You'll need to feed the Proto-Amourworm three Rice Cocoons, which are randomly found by breaking apart small cocoons in the Webbed Hollow. 

Once all three have been given, rest and return to find a Spirit has replaced the little worm, and you'll be able to absorb the Elder Amourworm Spirit!
