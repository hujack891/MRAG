# Skandha of Feeling

The Skandha of Feeling is one of the rarer Key Items in Black Myth: Wukong, as it is easy to miss, hidden away behind a secret boss in Yellow Wind Ridge. Despite collecting the Skandha of Felling in one of the earliest chapters, you won't actually be able to use the item until the very last area of the game in Chapter 6. 

_"Emotion is the child of uncertainty, born from the touch of experience. Once hidden inside the Buddha's head, this treasure has a secret yet to be revealed."_
