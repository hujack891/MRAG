# Supreme Celestial Inspector

Supreme Inspector is one of the main Character Bosses you'll need to fight in Chapter 6 of Black Myth: Wukong. The winged creature is the first boss you'll encounter in the Chapter, as The Destined One makes the climb to the top of the mountain. 

## How to Find the Supreme Celestial Inspector

The beginning of Chapter 6 is a linear path, so proceed down the slope from where you spawn until you reach the first Keeper's Shrine. Continue straight up from the Keeper's Shrine and into the clearing that's adorned by chains.

Make your way into the center of the clearing, where Bajie will exclaim it's a dead end. However, you'll soon be joined by the Supreme Celestial Inspector. If you found all of the Purple Talismans in Chapter 4, then this will be a familiar face to you. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Supreme Inspector

The Supreme Inspector will use two types of elemental attacks in this fight, which are thunder and fire. In the first third of the fight, it will mainly use thunder attacks, so you'll want to have plenty of Shock-Quelling Powder with you and equip any gear or curios that give you extra resistance to shock. Fire will be introduced in the second portion of the fight, so you'll also want Body-Cooling Powder, and the final part will be a combination of the two elements.

Though it might seem tempting to equip the Fireproof Mantle, we'd recommend using the Plantain Fan, which will be able to help you in the second phase of this fight. 

The first thing to note as you start the fight is that the Supreme Inspector will use its wings like a pair of arms. It will lunge and punch at you, so you'll need to learn the timings of its wing attacks.

Secondly, you can expect The Supreme Inspector to fly up into the air quite often, where it will continue to attack you but be unreachable. When it's up in the air, it will largely use projectiles. These are typically in groups and need to be dodged to avoid them. You can throw the Plantain Fan out when it's airborne to immediately bring it back down and leave it vulnerable to attacks.

The Supreme Inspector is also able to turn its wings to solid gold and deflect your attacks. You can still do damage when this happens, but it'll be minimal. Bajie will explain to you that when this happens, it's best to wait until it spreads its wings again. Still, you should try to be as aggressive as you can while you have Bajie helping you in the first part of the fight. As always, try to reserve any Gourd usage while you have Bajie, as he'll often top up your health. 

Besides the projectiles and using its wings to attack, the Supreme Inspector also uses a sword. This is where the thunder attacks come from, and they can vary significantly.

In the first portion of the fight, the Supreme Inspector will perform a combo of melee attacks using the sword, often followed by a grab from its feet. Alternatively, he will fly close to the ground and quickly charge toward you. You'll also see The Supreme Inspector rise up from the ground, twirl around, and send out shockwaves in multiple directions. You can move from side to side to avoid these or dodge out of the way. 

Around the halfway mark the Supreme Inspector will switch up attacks and they'll become more aggressive. The combos will become longer, but you'll see the same moveset from the first section.

The biggest change from here on out is that it introduces a fiery unicycle into the mix. This will make it easier for him to move around the arena, but he'll also kick it out and send this to attack you independently. When this is introduced, he'll be able to burn you.

The problem with this attack is there are two types of heavy attacks he'll perform here and they can be hard to avoid.

He'll either launch himself at you and then spin the unicycle around until he flips it up and lands down heavily where you are, or he'll start to spin around the entirety of the arena and multiple duplicates of the unicycle will appear. These will then launch into a crisscross attack to get you, and he'll follow up with a heavy attack.

When his health is down to the last third, he will cover the arena with a red haze, reducing the size of the arena that you'll fight the creature in. He will also begin to use two swords instead of one. This is when you want to throw out the Plantain Fan. It will clear the red haze immediately and continuously stun him, giving you more time to whittle down his health.
