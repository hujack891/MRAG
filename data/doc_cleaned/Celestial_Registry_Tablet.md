# Celestial Registry Tablet

The Celestial Registry Tablet is one of the many Curios items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. 

With the Celestial Registry Tablet equipped the experience points you earn from defeating enemies is slightly increased. 

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Celestial Registry Tablet Location
