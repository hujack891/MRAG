# How to Find the Five Skandhas and Unlock a Secret Boss

One of the earliest Key Items you might stumble across in Black Myth: Wukong is the Skandha of Form. However, it's not until the later stages of the game that this item becomes useful. There are 5 Skandhas to collect throughout the chapters, with 4 unlocking a secret boss in Chapter 6. Here's everything you need to know to get your hands on them. 

  1. Skandha of Form
  2. Skandha of Feeling
  3. Skandha of Thought
  4. Skandha of Choice
  5. Use the Four Skandhas
  6. Skandha of Consciousness
  7. How to Use the Five Skandhas

## How to Find the Skandha of Form

  * **Location: Chapter 1 (Black Wind Mountain, Forest of Wolves, Front Hill).**

From the Front Hills Keeper's Shrine in the Forest of Wolves, you'll work your way toward your first boss fight with the Bullguard. Opposite the mini-boss, you can find a stream.

As you approach for the first time, you'll see a monkey that's looking around by the river. Near where it stands, is a statue's head in the water.

When the monkey has run off, go to the head and collect the **Skandha of Form**. 

## How to Find the Skandha of Feeling

  * **Location: Chapter 2 (Yellow Wind Ridge, Fright Cliff, Rockrest Flat).**

This one can be obtained after finding the secret boss Shigandang in Chapter 2.

To fight Shigandang, you'll need to collect the 6 Buddha's Eyeballs. Deliver these to the area near Rockret Flat, where you'll fight the Stone Vanguard and Shigandang will appear.

When you've beaten the boss, it'll drop the Skandha of Feeling. 

## How to Find the Skandha of Thought

  * **Location: Chapter 3 (The New West, Valley of Ectascy, Mindfulnes Cliff)**

![Five Skandhas \(3\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4d/Five_Skandhas_%283%29.png)

You can collect the Skandha of Thought in Chapter 3 when you reach the Mindfulness Cliff Keeper's Shrine. To the right of the shrine, there's a large canyon, and there's actually a path below that you can drop down onto. 

![Five Skandhas \(10\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/37/Five_Skandhas_%2810%29.png)

Jump down there and follow the cave system, until you're back outside, then continue up the stairs and along the path. Turn right and head through the corridor to emerge on another cliff that's covered in snow. 

![Five Skandhas \(4\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/32/Five_Skandhas_%284%29.png)

Continue along the cliff's edge, where you'll see a statue above another cave entrance. Go inside here and up the stairs on the opposite side, where you'll see the monkey you saw near the first Skandha. 

![Five Skandhas \(14\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Five_Skandhas_%2814%29.png)

Once it's run away again, go up the stairs and get the Skandha of Thought from the head it was stood near. 

## How to Find the Skandha of Choice

  * **Location: Chapter 4: (The Webbed Hollow, Webbed Hollow, The Purifying Spring).**

![Five Skandhas \(5\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2e/Five_Skandhas_%285%29.png)

The Skandha of Choice can be found in Chapter 4. Go right from The Purifying Spring Keeper's Choice and up the stairs and through the gap in the wall. 

![Five Skandhas \(6\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d4/Five_Skandhas_%286%29.png)

Hug the wall on the right as you follow the path up to the next set of stairs and a wooden bridge. Cross the wooden bridge, and follow the path as it curves around to the left. 

![Five Skandhas \(7\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c6/Five_Skandhas_%287%29.png)

When you get to the end, you'll see a pathway leading up to the right and white sacs to the left of it. Behind these sacs is a bridge that will take you down to where you want to go. 

![Five Skandhas \(8\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/96/Five_Skandhas_%288%29.png)

Follow this to the end to be met with a Buddha's head and the monkey sitting on top of it. Approach, and the monkey will run off but you'll be able to collect the Skandha of Choice from the Buddha's head.

## Where to use the Four Skandhas

  * **Location: Chapter 6 (Mount Huaguo, Foothills, Verdant Path)**

Now that you have the Skandha of Form, Skandha of Feeling, Skandha of Thought, and Skandha of Choice, you'll need to wait until Chapter 6 and once you acquire the ability to travel on the clouds. 

![Five Skandhas \(19\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Five_Skandhas_%2819%29.png)

Fly using the clouds and go from the edge of the cliff, almost directly north of where you came. This will be where you can find the Son of Stones optional boss, with the Son sitting at the edge of the cliff. 

![Five Skandhas \(20\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5d/Five_Skandhas_%2820%29.png)

Beyond that, however, there's a large open area and a path that goes off to the right. 

![Five Skandhas \(21\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fc/Five_Skandhas_%2821%29.png)

You'll need to ascend quite high up, but where the path reaches a dead end, up above there's an opening in the cliff that you can pass through. Follow this until you enter an area that's slightly covered and pass through this tunnel. 

![Five Skandhas \(24\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/82/Five_Skandhas_%2824%29.png)

As you emerge in the wide open space, a Giant Shigandang will appear. 

![Five Skandhas \(26\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/00/Five_Skandhas_%2826%29.png)

Unfortunately, you will need to be on foot during the fight, so head for its fists and attack the blue crystals on it.

![Five Skandhas \(25\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/71/Five_Skandhas_%2825%29.png)

After defeating the boss, climb the arm that touches the ground and you'll meet the monkey again. Let the cutscene play and you'll get the Skandha of Consciousness. 

## How to Use the Five Skandhas

![Five Skandhas .png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2e/Five_Skandhas_.png)

With all five in your inventory, go to Xu Dog and deliver the Skandhas. You'll then have the option to tell Xu Dog to make the Five Skandhas Pill. Receiving this will boost your health, mana, and stamina.
