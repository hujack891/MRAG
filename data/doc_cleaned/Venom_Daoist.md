## Where to Find the Venom Daoist

The Venom Daoist's boss fight is a two-part optional boss encounter that you'll first find exploring the massive Webbed Hollow Portion of Chapter 4. When in the Upper Hollow, look for a ledge to drop down leading to the Pool of Shattered Jade past several hanging cocoons. In a small tunnel past the Shrine, you'll encounter a large cocoon that holds the Venom Daoist. 

After defeating him a first time, proceed through to the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Once you reach a fork in the road where the left path leads to the Court of Illumination Shrine, look for a path leading right up a mountain trail. Once you reach the top of the stairs, you'll find an alcove to the left leading down a large slope to an arena where the rematch will occur. 

## Venom Daoist Boss Fight and Guide - First Encounter

![Wukong UpperHollow 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Wukong_UpperHollow_36.jpg)

To commence the fight against the Venom Daoist, you'll need to bat the Odd Cocoon around like a pinata for awhile, until about half of its health bar is gone. Once your attack gets bounced away, the Venom Daoist will emerge, sporting two swords and eight arms to tear you apart. 

In reality, the Venom Daoist isn't the toughest opponent you've faced, but the low lighting will make it a little hard to see his attacks in his tangle of arms. Once you learn his positioning for his various attacks, you'll find plenty of opportunities to get in some of your own.

The Venom Daoist usually starts with his most basic attack, holding both swords to his side, and then springing forward with a dual slash on your right. He'll quickly follow up by rolling over to stab at the ground, and then after a moment leap into the air to slam down on top of you. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3e/Wukong_UpperHollow_38.jpg)

With a quick dodge to the side and behind him, you can avoid his first two attacks, and then sidestep his leap and begin your counterattack -- as it takes him several moments to rise up a second time. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/36/Wukong_UpperHollow_39.jpg)

If you see him hold his sword to the side but one sword high up behind his back, it means he's going to charge at you at a very fast speed. Dodge to the side, but then be ready for a second dash to come soon after requiring you to dodge once more. Try dodging alongside his second dash or lure him into a corner, and you'll find time to hit him while he resets himself. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f7/Wukong_UpperHollow_40.jpg)

When up close, he'll usually either perform an overhand slash followed by a leaping attack, or he'll pull back his swords to your left for two quick slashes followed by a dash attack. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/21/Wukong_UpperHollow_42.jpg)

Be ready for him to leap back with two more slashes after the dash, and wait until he returns to counter -- or simply Rock Solid his dash attack to stagger him back. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0d/Wukong_UpperHollow_41.jpg)

Attack his back when you can either by Immobilizing him or using Spirit Attacks for large area of effect hits, and you'll actually be able to start tearing apart his extra limbs, dealing massive damage in the process. 

When he starts to complain about this, be ready for more quick dashes as a retaliation strike. Still, he's not too great at adapting, since his attack with two jump slams will still cause him to expose his back when his swords are buried in the ground. 

![Wukong UpperHollow XX.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/af/Wukong_UpperHollow_XX.jpg)

When he starts getting low on health, expect him to get more desperate, throwing more sword slices into his combos. If you see him roll over himself at a distance, he'll slide at you foot first, but then vanish for a moment to appear straightened up before lashing out at you with a leap. Don't bother avoiding the slide, and just prepare to deflect his leap when he reappears. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2d/Wukong_UpperHollow_43.jpg)

After taking out 2-4 of his extra limbs, he'll likely run out of health, and will beat a hasty retreat. This isn't the last you'll see of him, and in fact he's essential to unlocking a secret area, so we'll look for him again later. At the very least, you'll earn experience and will both for beating him and his cocoon! 

## Venom Daoist Boss Fight and Guide - Second Encounter

In your last encounter with the Venom Daoist, he sported quite a bit of arms -- some of which you may have lopped off during the course of the fight. This time, he only has two extra arms, but the same rules still apply for this fight -- at least part of it. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 44.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/82/Wukong_YellowFlower_44.jpg)

In his first phase, he'll still use all the same moves you remember, including his most familiar crouching slash that hits twice before he leaps into the air to stab the ground. 

Just like before, this is also the best time to attack his extra arms, as you'll be able to deal a ton of damage and even jumpstart the second phase if you destroy them both. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 46.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ac/Wukong_YellowFlower_46.jpg)

Remember the timing of his other attacks, including his fast swipes before charging past you, then jumping back for another two hits. 

You'll also have to be ready to deflect or dodge if he crouches down with sword raised behind his head, as he'll dash forward and back at rapid speed. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 45.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/50/Wukong_YellowFlower_45.jpg)

A new move he can employ will have him toss one of his swords straight at you, then dash to pick it up while slicing with his second blade as he slides by. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 47.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/71/Wukong_YellowFlower_47.jpg)

Taking off one of his arms will deal a chunk of damage, but if you can try targeting both of his extra arms, removing them both will instantly deplete his health, and begin the second phase where demands a true fight: two arms vs two arms. 

He's got a lot more aggressive moves for this phase, and you'll need to be a bit more cautious as he has a lot less openings to retaliate than before. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 48.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8b/Wukong_YellowFlower_48.jpg)

To start, he often jumps up to float in the air a moment, tossing one sword after another at you, with the second sword landing a little farther past you. He'll then leap towards you and slash as he grabs both swords, ending with a mighty spinning slash to catch you trying to score a hit. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 49.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b5/Wukong_YellowFlower_49.jpg)

Be wary when he assumes a crouched stance with his swords up. He'll start walking forward while performing a series of twirling slashes, which can be tough to avoid as all six slashes come out very rapidly, so keep your distance or try to deflect them. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 53.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/41/Wukong_YellowFlower_53.jpg)

If his stance moves into holding both swords up high, he'll perform a similar combo string of four quick hits, followed by twirling both blades around him as moves forward to perform a final double slash that hits extremely hard -- again, making staying out of range your best bet. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 51.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2b/Wukong_YellowFlower_51.jpg)

His hardest hitting attack will come when he swaps to a reverse grip with his left sword, before dashing close to unleash three quick hits before flipping high into the air and slamming down for his "Flood of Blood" attack. Watch out for when he lands, as he'll also perform a last sweeping attack as he reorients himself. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 50.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/11/Wukong_YellowFlower_50.jpg)

Much of the rest of this fight will revolve around avoiding his lengthy combo attacks and retaliating after his last hit, or quickly evading or deflecting his charging dash attacks to stop him in his tracks. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 54.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/39/Wukong_YellowFlower_54.jpg)

Once the Daoist is defeated for good, he'll impart a mysterious message, telling you to "find the needle on Purple Cloud Mountain". As he departs, he mural will form on the nearby wall, which you can now interact with to travel to **Chapter 4's Secret Area: Purple Cloud Mountain**. As with other Secret Areas, we recommend exploring it before you proceed to the final boss of this chapter, as it will be instrumental in helping to defeat the final boss of this area.
