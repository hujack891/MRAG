# Flame Mediator

The Flame Mediator is one of the Uncommon Soaks for your Gourds in Black Myth: Wukong. 

With the Flame Mediator Soak equipped, using the gourd moderately increases Burn resistance for a short duration. 

Soaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Flame Mediator Location

The Flame Mediator Soak can be obtained from any of the Searing-Fire enemies within the Flaming Mountains. Farm them around the Field of Fire at the Cooling Slope until it randomly drops from one of them. 

Soaks are far more plentiful than the drinks for your gourds. They are scattered throughout the game, across each chapter. For even more guides on these areas, check out our full Black Myth: Wukong walkthrough. You can also keep track of the Awaken Wine Worm locations and Luoija Fragrant Vine locations, which are key to upgrading your healing potential and Gourd.
