## Turtle Treasure Location

Turtle Treasure can be found in the Furnace Valley. To reach it from the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine, run straight ahead until you can drop into the lava river on the right. Turn around in the lava and head back in the direction you came from to find Turtle Treasure guarding a chest at the end of the lava flow.

## Turtle Treasure Fight

Turtle Treasure is a large enemy that you must fight in a relatively enclosed space. The fight also takes place on lava, so you are going to want to get your hands on the Xiang River Goddess Gourd, which grants you temporary immunity from the lava after you use it. That way, you can fight without having to worry about your health constantly depleting. 

You can find the Xiang River Goddess Gourd in the chest-filled chamber you pass through on your way to fight the Elder Armourworm in the Webbed Hollow. 

While fighting Turtle Treasure, you will want to make sure to look out for the mallet it swings at you. A Pluck of Many or Immobilize makes this fight a lot easier if you don't have the Gourd.

  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increase Damage dealt by Heavy Attacks that cost 3 or 4 Focus Points. 

Turtle Treasure's Spirit allows you to take the beast's form and leap up into the air before slamming your massive mallet down onto the ground, creating a fiery explosion that deals epic damage to any enemies unfortunate enough to get caught underneath it. 

This move is powerful, as is the equipped effect, which increases the damage of any Heavy Attack that takes 3 or more Focus Points. Heavy Attacks that cost that many Focus Points are already strong, so to have them boosted even more is a great effect.
