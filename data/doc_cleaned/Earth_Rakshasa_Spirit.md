## Earth Rakshasa Location

Earth Rakshasa is a foe you can find in Furnace Valley in the Flaming Mountains. From the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine, run straight ahead until the stone pillars marking the entrance to the Misty Cloud, Cloudy Mist boss arena become visible. Take the path branching off to the left before you enter the boss arena to find Earth Rakshasa guarding a chest.

## Earth Rakshasa Fight

Earth Rakshasa enemies are one of the more difficult overworld enemies in Black Myth: Wukong. They are armed with giant, metal shields akin to those of Spearbones and use them to perform a similar charge move. Unlike Spearbones, however, the Earth Rakshasa can also create an explosion of fire to damage you even further. 

To defeat the Earth Rakshasa, hang back and wait until the enemy charges you. Dodge to the side just before the attack hits and quickly run back to hit it in the back and damage the Earth Rakshasa's body instead of its shield. It can be difficult to get around the shield, but casting Immobilize makes it much easier if you're struggling.

  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Damage Reduction for a short duration after being hit. 

The Earth Rakshasa's Spirit allows you to take the form of the creature and charge forward before smashing its giant shield into the ground, creating a barrier between you and your enemies. This not only damages foes but also creates a blockade, protecting you from enemy attacks while the shield remains. This can be an excellent way to block yourself from your enemy for a moment to take a sip from your Gourd or take some Medicine in relative safety. 

The equipped effect is also defensive, increasing your Damage Reduction after you get hit. This allows you to take less damage when experiencing a bombardment of attacks.
