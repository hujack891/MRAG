## Father of Stones Location

The Father of Stones is a large, black creature clutching a skeleton like a doll. He can be found lurking in the Flaming Mountains just past the Heart of Ember Keeper's Shrine. You will walk straight into his path as you progress further up the mountain, so don't worry about accidentally missing him.

## Father of Stones Fight

The Father of Stones is a unique enemy that relies on his massive body to deal damage. His most common attacks are stomps and spin attacks, where he flings the top half of his body around in a circle. You can also expect to see belly flops and a loud roar attack that deals damage and sends you flying if you are too close. The Father of Stones has a long tongue that he can whip you with, almost like the frog bosses, although it's not quite as powerful as theirs. 

The Father of Stones hits hard but is also rather slow. Stick to his back and press the dodge button to recover quickly when flung backward from his roar.

  * **Brute Force**
  * Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Critical Hit Chance and Critical Damage.

The Father of Stone's Spirit allows you to take the form of the beast and release two loud roars that both damage and cause any enemies within range to fly backward. This is a great attack to pull out if you're getting overwhelmed by a lot of enemies and need some space to sip from your Gourd or take any Medicine. The equipped effect is also good, increasing both your Critical Hit Chance and Critical Damage. You can boost this even further in the Skill Tree.
