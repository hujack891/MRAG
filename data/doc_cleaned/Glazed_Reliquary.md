# Glazed Reliquary

The Glazed Reliquary is one of the Curios items in Chapter 2 of Black Myth: Wukong. Unlike some of the other Curios' in this chapter, this one can easily be missed as it is in a rather well-hidden area. 

While perfect dodging, you will recover a small amount of stamina with this Curios equipped. Compared to most of the others, this one is particularly situational and unlikely to be as helpful for most players compared to many of the other Curios items.

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, you will want to switch to other Curios items to better fit your build as you play if you find the Glazed Reliquary isn't working for you anymore. This can be done from the Equipment menu. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Glazed Reliquary Location

The Glazed Reliquary can be found in a box by a statue, within the Windrest Hamelet area of the Yellow Sand Formation in Yellow Wind Ridge. As you make your way through this area, you will fight the Tiger Acolyte, obtain the Old Rattle-Drum, and be able to continue onwards into a cave. 

Just ahead, you can find the box with the Curios in.
