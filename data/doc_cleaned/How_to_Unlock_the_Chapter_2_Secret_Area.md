## How to Find the Yellow-Robed Squire (Drunken Boar NPC)

The first step to getting into the Chapter 2 secret area is to find the **Yellow-Robed Squire.** You won't be able to do this until you pass through Sandgate Village and into Fright Cliff. Pass by the Squall Hideout Keeperâ€™s Shrine and continue on the Rockrest Flat.

To the right, there's a set of stairs leading up to the sandfall. On the left, you'll find the entrance to an arena where you can fight the Stone Vanguard. If you go straight ahead, however, you'll see a small pathway that looks like it's blocked by a wooden fence. 

Smash through the fence and go straight ahead to find the Yellow-Robed Squire on the rock. Unfortunately, you won't get much out of him except for retching and mentions of jars from Windrest until you find a **key itemcalled the Sobering Stone**. There are two ways to get hold of the item, so here's what you need to know. 

## How to Get the Sobering Stone for the Yellow-Robed Squire - Method 1

The easiest way to get the Sobering Stone is through exploration and waiting until you reach the Yellow Sand Formation. The first place you'll come to is Windrest Bridge, which will take you up to Windrest Hamlet.

From the Windrest Bridge Keeper's Shrine, go across the bridge and into the small town ruins. On the other side of the bridge, go left. Then, take the stairs up to the right.

As you step into the next courtyard, turn to the left. You'll see a building with a broken wall. Head towards the gap here, and you'll find a glowing pot with the Sobering Stone in it.

Alternatively, you can complete the Man-in-Stone side quest but this unlocks the Sobering Stone for purchase. You can find the Man-in-Stone close to the Squall Hideout Keeper Shrine. Go right from the shrine, and find where it slopes down. 

![Chapter 2 Secret Area \(13\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cc/Chapter_2_Secret_Area_%2813%29.png)

At the back, there's a small bridge that you can pass under and follow a small stream. At the end of it, you'll find the Man-in-Stone trapped.

To help him, you'll need to beat the Mother of Stones boss you can find up the stairs to the left just before Rockrest Flat Keeper's Shrine. Defeating the Mother of Stones will grant you the Stone Essence key item you'll need to hand over to the Man-in-Stone. 

![Chapter 2 Secret Area \(12\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/28/Chapter_2_Secret_Area_%2812%29.png)

For a detailed walkthrough of the area and how to find both the Man-in-Stone and the Mother of Stones boss, see our Fright Cliff walkthrough. 

Giving him the Stone Essence will result in you needing to attack him. But once you've shown him who's boss, he'll turn into a merchant. The Sobering Stone costs 6,480 Will from him. 

## Take the Sobering Stone to the Yellow-Robed Squire

Once you have the Sobering Stone, bring it back to the Yellow-Robed Squire in Rockrest Flat. Once you've given the boar the stone, he'll move on to the Crouching Tiger Temple.

From the Temple Entrance Keeper's Shrine, head up the stairs and take the turning on the right just before you reach the top. You'll see the Yellow-Robed Squire slouched against the wall. When you speak to him he'll ask you for a treat of a **Jade Lotus**. If you don't have any of these, look for areas where there's water. You just need one; when you have it, bring it back to him and he'll move on from the Crouching Tiger Temple.

Thankfully, it's not too hard to find the Yellow-Robed Squire again but you'll need to have beaten the First Prince of Flowing Sands and grabbed the Arhat Gold Piece before you can continue. When you've met these conditions, he returns to the area where you first found him. This time, however, he won't be sitting on the rock. 

![Chapter 2 Secret Area \(9\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b9/Chapter_2_Secret_Area_%289%29.png)

Instead, look to the slope on the right when you first enter the area, to see him standing waiting. Approach him, and he won't be too happy about you having the gold piece, sparking a duel between the two of you. 

![Chapter 2 Secret Area \(10\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1f/Chapter_2_Secret_Area_%2810%29.png)

Beating him will reward you with the Snout Mask headgear piece, but you'll also be able to go into the door that's at the top of the slope here. Entering this will trigger a cutscene and you'll be transported to the Kingdom of Sahali.
