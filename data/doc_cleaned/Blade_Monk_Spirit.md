## Blade Monk Location

Blade Monk is a Spirit that lurks in the Pagoda Realm. It's easiest to find him after defeating Captain Wise-Voice and clearing the Pagoda. Once you've done so, head to the Outside the Wheel Keeper's Shrine and turn back to face the Pagoda. Head over to the platform on the right, where you will see a single wooden chest.

Drop down the side of the cliff to reach the platform below. There are a couple of smaller ledges that you can jump down to reach the level safely. Then, head all the way to the end to find the Blade Monk guarding an Awaken Wine Worm. Defeat him to collect his Spirit and collect the Awaken Wine Worm. 

## Blade Monk Fight

The Blade Monk fights like all other enemies of his kind with a massive sword. This sword hits hard, but the plus side is that it appears to be extremely heavy. Dodge each hit of the Blade Monk's combo and take the opportunity to land your own while he's recovering and gearing up for the next one.

  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Attack for a short duration after defeating an enemy.

The Blade Monk's Spirit Power allows you to take the form of the Monk and land your own combo with the massive sword he wields. Three swings are enough to deal a great amount of damage to your foe. The equipped effect is just as helpful, raising your attack after you've defeated an enemy. This is an excellent skill for crowds.
