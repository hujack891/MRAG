# Wind Bear Staff

The Wind Bear Staff is a Rare weapon in Black Myth: Wukong. It comes with solid stats, especially for the point in the game where you earn it. It is one of the best Weapons in the early game. 

This is largely down to its unique effect. With this weapon, the critical hit chance of the Unveiling Strike of Cloud Step is considerably increased. Pair that with the 4% Critical Hit Chance boost and 50 damage, and you have a really great weapon.
