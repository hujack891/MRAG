![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(6\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d9/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%286%29.png)

After jumping down from the cliff at the end of Woods of Ember, you'll land in the waters at the start of Furnace Valley. Immediately turn to the right, to pick up the first green Wisp in the region. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(9\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6b/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%289%29.png)

Go straight up toward the valley, but be careful as you explore the area. Some of the rocks in this area glow with lava, and that's because they're actually Searing-Fire enemies. These resemble the Palestones from Chapter 2 and are particularly annoying. They will leap in the air and drop on their back and front to cause explosions. For the sake of unlocking portraits, you can defeat just one and ignore the others. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(11\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/93/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2811%29.png)

Continue straight up, following the gold trail to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine. It's protected by an Earth Rakshasa, so either use heavy attacks to break down its shield, or get behind it to tackle it. When you've dealt with it, activate the Keeper's Shrine. 

### Return to the Pale-Axe Stalwart

Now that you've beaten two of the Five Element Carts, return to the Camp of Seasons Keeper's Shrine and revisit the Pale-Axe Stalwart. Exhaust all dialogue again, where he'll tell you that the carts belong to the Red Boy, and then jump back to the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine to continue your exploration. 

## Valley Entrance

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(13\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b7/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2813%29.png)

Make your way straight up from the Valley Entrance Keeper's Shrine. As you progress along this small pathway, you'll encounter Scorching-Fire enemies, similar to the Searing-Fire ones. These will attempt to hide along the path, so be prepared for them to jump out at you. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(14\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/66/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2814%29.png)

Stick to the path, as it curves around to the left. You'll enter a cave, with columns of ruins visible and lava all over the place. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(16\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/65/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2816%29.png)

Continue along the path, where it curves down to the right. Here you'll find another Earth Rakshasa patrolling. Once you've dealt with the fire-breathing Rakshasa, keep going toward the pillar. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(17\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ed/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2817%29.png)

Ultimately, you're going to go left to continue on the main path (and you may start to hear characters talk as you approach this pillar), but for now, you'll want to detour and explore the area to the right. 

The first thing you'll see as you go to the right is the Flamlings that sit in the lava. These will spit fire at you, so it's best to deal with them to remove the ranged attacks while you explore. 

### A Note on Flamlings

Flamings will drop Flame Ores, which are an important item needed for a secret boss later on in the Chapter, so be sure to tackle each Flamling you find.

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(19\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0f/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2819%29.png)

Go for the one on the left first, then continue straight up. Another Flamling will emerge as you tackle this first one, so head for this one straight after. If you keep pushing forward, another batch of Flamlings will emerge, so we'd recommend taking them all down before you head over to the left side of the room and hop into the stream of lava. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(22\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a5/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2822%29.png)

Go into the lava, where you'll see the wall is glowing. This will be the first stream of lava coming from the wall you will have been near when fighting the first Flamling. Just before it, you can find a Purple Lingzhi to harvest, which becomes another fungiman you need to defeat. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(26\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/ce/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2826%29.png)

Continue up the stream of lava to find another Flamling and a tree to harvest for a Fire Date. Now go right, where you should see a cart just to the left. There is a green Wisp to collect right by its arm, and a chest opposite it that won't necessarily be visible to you yet. But what will be, is the Tenner guarding it. 

Approach carefully and deal with the Tenner and the Flamlings that will appear as soon as you're close to the cart. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(27\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cc/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2827%29.png)

When the area is clear, collect the green Wisps and open the chest to collect Fine Gold Thread and Blood of the Iron Bull.Now approach the cart. This is one of the Five Element Carts, but it's already been dealt with. Get close to its mouth and pull the string when prompted. When you do, you'll hear the voice of Ma Tianba (the horse guai from previous chapters) coming from inside. Keep pulling the string until you've exhausted all dialogue, and then move on. There's nothing more you can do here for now, but we'll return later. 

Face away from the cart and back in the direction you came from. There's more to explore at the moment, before you continue up to the archway you can see in the distance. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(28\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6a/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2828%29.png)

Go left, at the first lava stream you can see running from the ceiling. Take another left, so you're heading back on yourself (just on the lower level) toward where you started Furnace Valley. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(32\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2832%29.png)

Right at the end of this path, you'll find a Turtle Treasure guarding a chest. This Turtle Treasure holds a Spirit for you to collect once you've beaten it. After grabbing the Turtle Treasure Spirit, open the chest to collect Kun Steel, Knot of Voidness, and Medicines. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(33\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/59/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2833%29.png)

Backtrack on yourself and go straight up through the path on the left between the rocks. Head for the lava stream running from the ceiling straight up ahead but stop to kill the last Flamling on the right, just behind the rock, and harvest the Fire Date from the tree on the right. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(35\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a7/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2835%29.png)

When you reach the lava, go to the dark corner on the right to collect the green Wisp. As you approach, you'll be jumped by Scorching-Fire rocks, so be prepared. Then, go up the ramp on the left to meet another Earth Rakshasa and take this out. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(37\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7c/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2837%29.png)

Head through the archway, where you'll see another Flamling emerge on the right. Take the Flamling out and look down to the left, below the edge of the cliff where it sat. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(38\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b4/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2838%29.png)

Drop down here, and head right first to collect the Fire Date from the tree. Then go in the opposite direction toward the lava streaming from the ceiling. This is where you can find one of the optional bosses in Chapter 5, the Flint Chief. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Flint Chief

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(40\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bf/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2840%29.png)

The Flint Chief is another rock boss in the game, that will try to use all its might in its attacks, so the moveset will seem familiar. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(43\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/64/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2843%29.png)

A lot of the moves will see the Chief attack with long sweeps or hitting the ground with its fists. Ripples of lava will often follow these attacks, so using the Fireproof Mantle will give you some protection against the fire damage. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(41\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/44/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2841%29.png)

There are three areas you can concentrate attacks, which are its body and two hands. It's best to target the two hands, as these are actually breakable and by removing them, the Flint Chief becomes a lot more unsteady on its feet. Focus combos, follow-ups, and heavy attacks on its hands to remove them as quickly as possible. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(44\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/23/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2844%29.png)

When you've beaten it collect the Flint Chief Spirit it drops and the Fire Date from the tree to the right of the lava flowing from the ceiling. 

Follow the lava path back up the archway, collecting more Fire Dates on the way, and be careful of Scorching and Searing-Fire enemies that will pop out along the way. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough .png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bc/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_.png)

When you're back up to the arch, continue forward to the top of the slope. The path goes left and right here. Right is the main path, so for now, let's take a look at the left side. As you head over, you'll see an Earth Rakshasa waiting for you that guards a chest. It also has a Spirit for you to collect once you defeat it. 

As soon as you pass by the torch, a Flamling will appear. Take down the Flamling and Rakshasa, then collect the Earth Rakshasa Spirit. After this, open the chest and collect Celestial Ribbon and a Mind Core. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(45\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ec/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2845%29.png)

Now turn back the other way and continue up the valley. At the top of the path, you'll come to another archway and the start of Rakshasa Palace. 

As soon as you pass through the archway, the next boss battle will begin and you'll discover who was responsible for the voices you heard earlier. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Cloudy Mist, Misty Cloud

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(49\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/25/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2849%29.png)

Cloudy Mist and Misty Cloud are another duo that will use different elements to fight you. You'll go up against Cloudy Mist first, who is the creature with the staff. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(54\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a6/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2854%29.png)

It will mainly shoot lasers from the smaller face on its chest and use projectiles. The way that these attacks appear can vary wildly from one laser at a time, to multiple in a criss-cross pattern. As for the projectiles, you'll see either a few larger balls of mist or multiple tiny ones sent your way. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(55\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/67/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2855%29.png)

The lasers can be avoided by dodging or jumping over them, and the projectiles can be outrun or you can dodge to stop them hitting you. When there are numerous, we'd recommend outrunning them, and when there are just a few, dodge out of the way. During this fight, you want to stay as close to Cloudy Mist as possible, to remove the advantage of his long-range attacks. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(53\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5c/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2853%29.png)

Misty Cloud will soon appear, though he will look almost see-through initially. He will often pop up as soon as Cloudy Mist has finished a set of moves, hoping to catch you off guard and hit you with his flaming bundle. 

The key to keeping track of this creature is to see where the cloud moves and jump out of the way when it gets close to you. Misty Cloud favors the use of a flaming bundle, operating it like a hammer and delivering fire attacks. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(50\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/27/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2850%29.png)

As Cloudy Mist is the first to appear, this should be where you first attack. Things will change when you manage to hit Cloudy Mist enough times that it will send out a bright light as a flashbang that can stun both you and Misty Cloud. For a brief moment, Misty Cloud won't be able to see you and Cloudy Mist will become its eyes. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(56\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/74/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2856%29.png)

When this happens, you'll want to focus on dodging the fire attacks from Misty Cloud. These often happen with him dragging the flaming bundle along the floor, to try and create a ripple of flames to get you. Or slamming it down like a hammer. There will be times when he puts the bundle on his back, and he's slow with this move, so you've got plenty of time to attack. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(52\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b0/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2852%29.png)

The fight can feel quite fast-paced as they swap in and out to attack, so to put an end to their teamwork and slow things down, make use of spells like Immobilize. You should then aim to build as much Focus as possible and look for opportunities to perform heavy attacks. Both bosses can be staggered by this, giving you a chance to whittle down their health. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(61\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0f/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2861%29.png)

After defeating them collect the Spirit they drop, then continue up the stairs toward the palace. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(63\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/07/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2863%29.png)

Open the giant door at the top of the stairs. Go straight ahead and activate the Rakshasa Palace Keeper's Shrine. 

## Rakshasa Palace

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(67\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8b/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2867%29.png)

Just beyond the shrine, there's a small area for you to explore. As you step toward the Keeper's Shrine, you'll likely see the golden box on the log just behind it. Go here to pick up a Celestial Taiyi Pill. 

Then look opposite the golden box to see a treasure chest inside the small building. Open this to pick up Blood of the Iron Bull and some gold pieces. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(70\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/00/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2870%29.png)

Head back the other way and toward the steps. Before you go up them, you'll want to explore the lava on either side. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(80\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/22/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2880%29.png)

Go left first and tackle the Bull Soldier, then look underneath the first curved portion of the bridge to absorb a green Wisp. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(72\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/31/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2872%29.png)

Continue on the path to the left (running alongside the wall) to pick up the Fire Date from the tree on the right and take out the Bull Stalwart. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(74\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ec/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2874%29.png)

Hug the path to the left and continue along the lava, until you reach another tree to harvest a Fire Date and a statue on the right. Take the slope up and pick up the green Wisp from underneath the bridge directly opposite. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(76\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/10/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2876%29.png)

Then, go left and deal with the Stalwart and open the treasure chest it guards to collect Fine Gold Thread and Blood of the Iron Bull. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(78\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0d/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2878%29.png)

Head in the opposite direction and go underneath the bridge to loop back around to the right, and the first set of stairs now. Deal with the guard there, before proceeding up them. 

Keep following the staircases, turning right after the next set to cross the bridge toward the bull guard with the two staffs and the two Flame Rhino Masters. 

Cross the bridge and up the small set of stairs, towards the giants. On the right, you'll encounter a Bull Governor. Though it's best to deal with the creature now, don't go to the right just yet. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(99\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/be/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2899%29.png)![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(100\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cd/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%28100%29.png)

Instead, take the path to the left. You'll see a set of stares with the Flame Rhino Master at the top, and a small temple with a flame glowing inside. Head for the stairs first and take out the Flame Rhino Master, then hop over to the temple. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(101\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fe/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%28101%29.png)

Inside here, you'll find the old man who gave you the gourd at the start of the game and an Awaken Wine Worm to the left. 

Speak to the old man, and he'll tell you to find yourself a decent gourd (if you haven't already upgraded yours fully) and you can share a drink with him. 

## How to Complete the Old Man's Questline

Upgrade your Old Gourd to the Medicine Buddha Gourd. When you've done this, speak to him and then examine the flame in the center of the room. Your Gourd will absorb the spirit and become the Supreme Gourd. If the trophy for this side quest doesn't pop, for you, make sure you visit each of the Chapters before and revisit his locations to hear all of his dialogue. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(102\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/25/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%28102%29.png)

Exit the temple and stick to the lava path on the left. Take out the two giants (the Sea Rakshasa) by aiming for their ankles and knocking them down. Behind the first one, you'll find green Wisps to collect. Meanwhile, for defeating the second one, you'll be rewarded with the Golden Button curio. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(103\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/85/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%28103%29.png)

Return to the stairs where you first left to see the old man. Cross the covered bridge in the center, then take out the bull guard and master by the stairs on the left. Head up here, and activate the next Keeper's Shrine. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(104\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e1/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%28104%29.png)

## The Emerald Hall

From The Emerald Hall Keeper's Shrine, go left and up the stairs. A cutscene will start to play, where you'll transform into a Cicada and fly toward the center of the hall. This is where you'll find Pingping speaking to her mother, Rakshasi, accompanied by the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains. 

After they discuss The Destined One obtaining the relics, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains offers to care for Rakshashi, which Pingping protests. After he binds Pingping, Rakshashi is revealed to be Zhu Bajie transformed and it's time to take on the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains for yourself. 

### Yaoguai King - Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and Yin-Yang Fish

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(83\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fe/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2883%29.png)

The Keeper of the Flaming Mountains will transport you to another place, in a monochrome illusion where he uses the power of yin-yang. Zhu Bajie will be there to help you at first, so focus on attacking the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains as quickly as you can. This is a two-phase fight, and as you might expect, the second phase is where the action really begins. 

In the first phase, try to hold off on using your spells as much as you can. Instead, try to be aggressive and relentlessly attack the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains while he's on the ground. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(86\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f7/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2886%29.png)

He will start to attack using white projectiles, which can be dodged or outrun. When you've got his health down to around 60-70%, he will use the white and black orbs to summon undead enemies. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(89\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cb/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2889%29.png)

The white revenants are large enemies with clubs, while the black revenants are archers. These are the ones you want to target, as their ranged attacks can be annoying and do the most damage. Clear these revenants out as quickly as possible, to get it back to a fight against just the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains. 

When you've got his health down to around 30%, Zhu Bajie will leave you to take him on one-on-one. The aim is still to just attack normally to get his health bar down quickly. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(93\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/44/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2893%29.png)

When he's almost dead, he will then summon Ma Tianba for you to fight against. 

### Missable Transformation Spell

As we mentioned earlier, at the start of Furnace Valley there is a dead cart. You need to pull the string and exhaust the dialogue from the horse guai Ma Tianba before you defeat him in this fight. Otherwise, you will miss out on the Dark Thunder Transformation Spell. Once you've beaten the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and the Yin-Yang Fish, return to the cart and pull the string to get the Transformation Spell.

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(92\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e1/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2892%29.png)

Ma Tianba uses a whip and has his own health bar that resembles a normal enemy's health bar. The fight is fairly straightforward in this first phase, but as soon as you've defeated the horse guai, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains drops the Yin-Yang Fish into the water. 

The giant creature soon emerges and will begin attacking. It has a variety of moves that you'll see it perform during the fight. But the main thing is now you should make use of all your spells and transformations that you saved from the first round. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(98\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/16/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2898%29.png)

You'll see the Yin-Yang Fish rear itself up from the water and spray a jet at you, or flip itself up and over, to try and hit you with a tail flick. Staying close to it will stop it from being able to hit you with the jet spray, but will make it more likely to try and tail-whip you. 

It will also use projectiles and throw out orbs to chase you down. These can be dodged or outrun in a similar manner to that of the Keeper of the Flaming Mountain's attacks. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(97\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0c/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%2897%29.png)

When you've knocked its health down to almost halfway, it will begin to move quite erratically and cover a large amount of distance across the arena. Use Cloudstep to catch up to it and sneakily attack and Immobilize to temporarily halt it from darting off. 

This is also when it will begin to float up in the air and throw the projectiles down. You'll need to dodge in quick succession to avoid these. 

Once you've beaten the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains and the Yin-Yang Fish, you'll be returned to The Emerald Hall. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(114\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ae/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%28114%29.png)

Turn and face away from the altar. There are two places you'll want to go here to get collectibles. First, head to the stairs, but take the small path down to the right. Follow this to find a golden turtle, where you can get the Slumbering Beetle Husk. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(115\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8b/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%28115%29.png)

Then go back to the stairs and head for the balcony (facing opposite the altar in The Emerald Hall). Turn to the right, and go up the stairs to find the Meditation Spot. 

![Furnace Valley Walkthrough \(106\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/28/Furnace_Valley_Walkthrough_%28106%29.png)

Now go back to The Emerald Hall and up to the altar near where you respawned. Collect the Loong Balm drink from the altar then turn left.

To continue along the main path head up the stairs and onto the ashen path. Follow it up and around to the left, crossing over the bridge and heading toward the archway in the distance.

Step through the archway and look to the left to see a treasure chest. Open this to find Blood of the Iron Bull and gold pieces. Proceed up the stairs to the right, past the bull guard, and fire will start to rain down on you -- which you know means another cart is not far off!

Take the stairs up to the right and follow these up and into the dark cave. Then go right again, and up the next set of stairs to find the Crimson-Silver Cart 

### Yaoguai Chief - Crimson Silver Cart

If you've exhausted all the dialogue with the Pale-Axe Stalwart so far, the first thing you'll notice is that you've got his help when it comes to beating this boss.

The only real difference between this fight and the one with the previous carts is that the Crimson-Silver Cart has a wider area that it attacks in. Not only will it shoot flames out at the bottom all around it, but it will also roll around and try to mow you down. 

As soon as you see smoke start to build around it, you'll want to move out of its way, because this is when the fire is coming. Beyond that, you'll also notice tweaks to the punching attacks. Rather than just slamming its fists down once, it will try to land a combo of punches. 

To make the fight easier, use Immobilize to keep the cart locked in place. That way, you and the Pale-Axe Stalwart can work together to quickly whittle down its health.

After the fight, speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart again and exhaust his dialogue. Then go along the tree trunk near him to collect the green Wisps that sit on it.

Return to the main path and follow this up the mountain. You'll come to a set of stairs, with a Rhino Flame Master at the top of it.

Continue up the stairs to the left, and follow the rocky path up to the top of the mountain, where you'll reach the Ashen Pass III Keeper's Shrine and be ready to take on the Field of Fire.

If you haven't already, go back to the Valley Entrance to get the Dark Thunder Transformation Spell from Ma Tianba in the dead cart. You'll know when you arrive if you'll get the spell, as he'll tell you to come closer before his soul departs. This time, the option to Pull Forcefully will appear. Pull the whip and you'll receive the Dark Thunder spell.
