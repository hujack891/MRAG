## Where to Find the Black Wind King

As a required boss, you won't be able to miss running into the Black Wind King. Once you reach the Black Wind Cave area, simply head through the tunnel, take out any Wolf Assassins that may appear, and keep to the right when you spot a Meditation Spot to continue through the darkened passages to reach the Cave Interior Shrine, where the King waits beyond the nearby doors. 

## Black Wind King Boss Fight and Guide

The self-imposed King of the Black Wind Mountain has been waiting for you, and though he’s only facing you now in his human form, he’s got a lot of powerful attacks to watch out for.

The Black Wind King will start the fight with a jumping spear thrust, pausing in mid-air briefly before lunging forward, and powering his spear with the Black Wind to throw it into the ground in front of him as he lands. 

He’ll often follow this jumping attack with two spins of his spear until it lands behind him, and give you a big opportunity to commence an attack of your own as he recovers from the move.

Any time he empowers his spear with the black wind effect, you can bet he’ll move close to perform up to three big slash attacks in short succession. Always wait until the third attack lands before trying to counter, and use your Spirit Attack when you know you have room to land the hit.

Be on your guard whenever you try to attack him head on, as his favorite attack at close range is taking a quick swig of his own gourd before breathing flames in front of him. A quick dodge can put you behind him, allowing you to continue your light attack combo as he finishes spraying the area in front of him.

If you see him raise one foot up, quickly Immobilize or dash to the side, as he’ll try to stagger you with a quick kick, and then race forward with his spear to keep charging into you for multiple hits that’s nearly impossible to get out of once he starts.

His most frustrating attack will come when he transforms into the Black Wind itself, becoming a wisp-like thing that floats around the arena. You’ll need to look carefully for the small “bursts” emanating from the wisp that denote its charge attack straight at you, and can happen in two quick dashes back and forth.

Once you see the wisp fly up, retreat away from the center of the arena where the Black Wind King will reappear in a large explosion. Take this time to heal up or use any consumable medicines you think might give you an edge.

After losing about half his health, the Black Wind King will get even more aggressive with his titular wind, and start disappearing entirely in a gust without forming into a wisp. When this happens, retreat and regain your stamina, and be ready for the moment he appears, as he’ll likely do so in mid-combo attack.

These can include a length combo that he’ll usually start with a shove before stabbing his spear into the ground in front of him, then grabbing onto it to launch himself off feet first before quickly slicing downward at you, and then slamming his fist down for a massive explosion you’ll want to steer clear of.

After his next Black Wind assault, be ready to transform using the Red Tides Spell, and charge up a dash attack the moment he lands in the center of the arena, and use it and the transformation spell’s pogo attack to perform a massive hit once you catch him after a teleport.

Counter each of his teleports when his attacks complete, and you’ll soon defeat the Yaoguai King, forcing him to retreat as he yells for you to face his true form at the top of the mountain. However, in his retreat, he’ll leave behind some of his Black Wind, which the Keeper of the Mountain will harness and pass onto you, giving you a brand new spell: **Cloud Step**.
