# How to Parry

Black Myth: Wukong doesn't have traditional blocking or parrying techniques, but there _are_ ways to deflect incoming enemy attacks. If you want to be able to deflect melee attacks and stagger enemies, you'll need to unlock a spell in Chapter 2 allowing you to do so. With that in mind, here's everything you need to know from how to get hold of Rock Solid to how and when to use it.

Can you parry in Black Myth: Wukong? The short answer is no, not in the traditional sense. But you can deflect enemy attacks, and to do so requires the **Rock Solid spell**. This is a defensive spell that will allow you to stagger enemies and open up the possibility of performing counterattacks.

You'll need to wait until you reach Chapter 2 and have defeated the Tiger Vanguard at the Crouching Tiger Temple before you can unlock it. Slaying the Tiger Vanguard will automatically grant you the Rock Solid spell and let you turn your monkey into stone. 

Once you have the spell, visit a Keeper's Shrine and select Self-Advance to see the option to Set Spells. Replace Cloud Step with Rock Solid, and you're ready to start parrying. 

## How to Parry Enemy Attacks in Black Myth: Wukong

Once Rock Solid is equipped, it all comes down to timing to ensure the success of a deflection. Generally speaking, when an enemy initiates their attack, that's the moment you want to press R2 and Triangle (PS5), RB and Y (PC/Controller) or 2 (PC/Keyboard). 

Each enemy will have different timings to their attacks, however, so it might take some practice getting it right for the different Yaoguais. Look for visual prompts such as enemies raising their weapons and shields or leaning back to spot the start of their attacks.

Each successful use of the Rock Solid spell will result in sparks flying and a "ching" sound, letting you know you've got it right and deflected. With lesser Yaoguais, parrying with Rock Solid will stagger them for a few seconds and leave them open to counterattacks. 

Keep in mind, however, that you**cannot block attacks** , and deflecting with Rock Solid **cannot stagger all enemies**. 

## Spells to Unlock to Upgrade Rock Solid

With the Rock Solid spell now yours, the Alteration tab of the Self-Advancement menu will now show the Rock Solid skill tree alongside Cloud Step. There are 6 different skills you can awaken to improve Rock Solid, which are: 

Skill Name | Effect | Cost   
---|---|---  
Rapid Return | Allows you to cancel Rock Solid | 1 Spark   
Rock Mastery | Reduces the cooldown of the spell | 1 Spark   
Nick of Time | Gain Focus when you successfully Deflect | 1 Spark   
Upperhand | Increases Light Start Attack damage after a successful Deflection | 1 Spark   
Ironclad | Damage Reduction given after a Deflection | 1 Spark   
Bold Venture | Recover Mana when successfully Deflecting | 2 Sparks (can be upgraded twice)   

Rock Mastery, Ironclad, and Bold Venture are particularly useful. With this combination of skills, when you're successful at Deflecting, you can recover Mana quickly, and take less damage for a short amount of time. With the Mana recovery and the Rock Mastery reducing the cooldown of the spell, you can get more use of Rock Solid in fights.
