## Where to Find The Old Ginseng Guai

The Old Ginseng Guai hides within the large Valley of Ecstasy region that you can reach after exploring past the Bitter Lake in The New West area. You'll need to stick to the main road through the Forest of Felicity to find a high ridge path, and take one of several exits on the left to enter the Towers of Karma area.

In the forested fields of the Towers of Karma, head to the back wall to find the titular stone monuments, and follow the path past the Shrine to the far corner of this area where a large monument is located in a muddy field surrounded by Aged Ginseng plants. Pluck them all, and you'll find the one in the center is actually a boss! 

### Old Ginseng Guai Miniboss Fight and Guide

This hulking brute isn't as deadly as the Non-Able boss fight, but he does has a few tricks up his sleeve. As you might expect, he can deal a lot of damage with poisonous roots much like the lesser Ginsengling, so having antimiasma medicine on hand is a good strategy. 

Many of the Old Ginseng Guai's attacks are slow and hard-hitting, and the guai himself moves at a fairly slow pace, making him the perfect target for hit and run attacks as needed.

He can perform a variety of lurching stomp attacks, many of which will create a small area of poisonous roots. Like the ice frog, you'll want to take back control of the battlefield by reorienting yourself, and use the Thrust Stance to hit him with charged strikes while staying out of the poison.

If he winds up his hand to slam it down into the ground, he'll sneakily send roots your way, which he can use to lock you down and make you unable to flee from his next attack or if you're already stuck in some poison -- but using the Pillar Stance can help you evade his binds.

Even with his slow speed, he's capable of using his stumbling lurches to lunge at you, so be ready for him to attack with an elbow drop with surprising reach, or a flailing kick that sends him staggering toward you.

Many times, he'll end his flailing by spinning around and then falling backward right on top of you. He'll have his own version of Rock Solid when he does this and flash yellow, so it's better to just evade him entirely.

By far his biggest and most threatening move comes when he plants his hand in the ground to grow an increase area of poison roots all around him. The range on this is fairly big, and he'll continue to grow it for some time, giving you a few options: stay well away and heal up, or climb onto your staff (with a full stamina bar) and wait it out.

After he's done creating the root system, he'll finally tear the whole thing up in a massive burst (at which point you can slam down from your Pillar Stance), however in doing so he'll summon a small group of mini Ginsenglings to attack you.

They behave much in the same way as regular Ginsenglings do, moving slightly faster than the boss, which can help you lure them away from his attacks. Prioritize taking them out first so you don't get blindsided later, and try the Ashen Slumber transformation spell to detonate yourself near them, or use Spirit Attacks with wide reaches.

Stick to staying in safe spots to keep using Thrust Stance out of the range of his roots, or Pillar Stance above him, and look for his many openings when he tumbles to the ground to press the attack, and he'll fall before long, granting you both the **Old Ginseng Guai Spirit** , Millenium Ginseng Seeds to give to Chen Loong, and the **Ginseng Cape** to wear.

With the Yaoguai Chief defeated, be sure to check around behind the large stone monument near where you fought the miniboss. On a small snow-covered table, you can find the **Jade Essence** \- a new Gourd Drink that allows you to recover mana as well as health!
