## Where to Find Non-Void

Non-Void is an optional boss, but also cannot be triggered unless you have started the Snow Fox Quest near the Forest of Felicity Shrine in the Valley of Ecstasy. The Fox will tell you that a monk killed her, and now resides in the New Thunderclap Temple, but doesn't tell you exactly where.

You'll need to enter the large temple complex, and make your way straight from the Shrine through the entrance courtyard and into the central plaza. After climbing the stairs, head left from the small central building to enter a large building on the left, where you can climb the stairs up and find a door up to a large temple building.

At the entrance to this temple, you can now use the Snow Fox Brush in your inventory to transform into The Fox, and step inside to trigger a cutscene (if you enter first you can speak to him, but transforming near the monk will instantly trigger the fight without a scene). 

### Non-Void Miniboss Fight and Guide

The monk who killed the Fox Guai you encountered in the Forest of Felicity, Non-Void is one of the disciples of Yellowbrow, and has his own set of peculiar moves. While he doesn't deal elemental damage, he can be a hard target to pin down due to his ability to become non-corporeal, causing some of your attacks to pass right through him! 

The key to defeating this foe is to learn his attacks, and more importantly learning which parts leave him vulnerable to counters, and when you won't able to hurt him. Whenever he becomes transparent, avoid using any moves like Immobilize as you'll just waste their cooldowns and mana.

Instead, watch his attacks carefully. His most basic attack will begin when he draws his arm in before lashing out with a straight jab with his long claws. Ignore the urge to retaliate, and instead wait a moment for him to follow-up with an incorporeal backhand followed by a blazing palm strike. 

You'll have two options to counter this move: by dodging the third and final strike, you can use this time to capitalize on the end of his combo with Immobilize or Spirit Attacks to send him stumbling.

Once you've learned the timing of his combo, you can also perform a Rock Solid Deflection on his second strike even when he's incorporeal, and the deflection will knock him backward and out of his transparent form, allowing you to press your attack.

If you take too long to recover and try to rush him, he's likely to fade away and warp backward while immune to damage, so only expend your focus points if you're catching him at the right time.

He can also form energy around himself by moving his arms in a circle. This will cause all the scattered pages around the floor to form into a whirling tornado, which he'll send at you.

While it can be dodged, the paper tornado will constantly follow you, and Non-Void will use this opportunity to cast more projectiles at you. Luckily, you can actually utilize your Staff Spin to disperse the tornado. The moment you see the papers flutter back to the ground, resume your assault! 

When trying to press your attack against him, watch for one of his incorporeal evasions where he twirls around to the side of you. He'll often end this movement by preparing a large palm blast attack. Though he'll do so while still transparent, it can be deflected with Rock Solid, or evaded as he'll return to solid form after the attack ends.

Another attack he can perform while you engage him from the front will start when he bunches up his fists close to his body. He'll explode outward with a simultaneous punch and kick move, and then after a moment will follow up with two charging fist strikes while phased out, sending him forward several steps to pursue any backward evasions. 

Once you learn to anticipate these attacks, you'll find it easier to outmaneuver him, and look for the best opening to expend your focus points and deal the most damage (doing so when he's Immobilized is also a good guarantee).

Similarly, any Transformation can deal good damage here, but be sure not to expend your final attack when he's phasing out, or you'll waste it entirely. 

When Non-Void finally falls to your assault, you'll be able to absorb the Non-Void Spirit. 

### Completing the Snow Fox Questline

You should make a point to return to the Forest of Felicity the next chance you get, and return to talk to the Snow Fox pelt on the corpse near the Shrine. As thanks, The Fox will give the **Snow Fox Brush Curio** , which will extend your Transformation times by a great deal!
