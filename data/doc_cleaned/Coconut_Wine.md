# Coconut Wine

Coconut Wine is the default drink in Black Myth: Wukong, so it can't be found. It is given to you at the start of Chapter 1. Compared to the other Drinks in the game, it offers the most basic buff, but arguably the best for the Gourds.

With the Coconut Wine equipped, you will restore 33% of your maximum health with each Gourd use by default. However, as with all Drinks, the potency of this can be increased by finding the Awoken Wine Worm locations around each of the game's chapters. Our guide has all of their locations for you. 

You can then use these unique Crafting Materials to upgrade the Drink at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove within Black Wind Mountain. Each upgrade will provide a sizeable buff to your healing potential, but as you level the Drink up, more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed. 

This carries over to New Game Plus too, as you can upgrade your Drinks even more, but once again more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed, so you will have to recollect them all in your new game plus run. 

Despite the Coconut Wine being the first Drink you get, chances are you will stick with it for most of your playthrough, unless you are keen to play in a specific way, healing in an alternative way, or want to sacrifice some of your healing potential overall. 

There aren't too many Drinks in the game compared to the Soaks, so be sure to keep your eye out for them. Although, they tend to be located close to the main path through a chapter or area. For even more guides on these areas, check out our full Black Myth: Wukong walkthrough.
