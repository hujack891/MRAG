# Thunderbolt Horn

The Thunderbolt Horn is one of the Uncommon Soaks for your Gourds in Black Myth: Wukong. It offers a rather specialized buff to your Gourd, compared to some of the flat-out damage negation buffs or health boosts some of the Soaks offer. 

When using the Gourd with the Thunderbolt Horn equipped, it will moderately increase Shock resistance for a short duration, which can be great against enemies or bosses that deal Shock damage.

Your Soaks can't be upgraded. Unlike the Drinks and the Gourd itself, which can be upgraded. Therefore, you can't enhance the effect of the Thunderbolt Horn. If you want to switch to a different Soak, be sure to visit the Shen Monkey Vendor throughout your game to continue equipping new ones.
