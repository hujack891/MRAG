# Blood Stained Needle

The Blood Stained Needle is one of the final Key Items you will find in Black Myth: Wukong. It is automatically given to you upon exploring The Webbed Hollow. 

_"With our hearts entwined, even after a century together, we still yearn for more time."_  

To obtain the Blood Stained Needle, you need to defeat Zhu Bajie for the second time in The Lower Hollow in The Webbed Hollow. This is a part of the main chapter progression, so you can't miss it. 

## Where to use the Blood Stained Needle in Black Myth: Wukong

The Blood-Stained Needle is automatically used during The Duskveil fight at the end of the Purple Cloud Mountain secret area in The Webbed Hollow. During the fight, it will become the Weaver's Needle, one of the more powerful Vessels in the game.
