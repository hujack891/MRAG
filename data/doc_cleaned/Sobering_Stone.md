The Sobering Stone is located in a vase in the village at Yellow Wind Formation - Windrest Bridge, to the left as you enter the village. From the Crouching Tiger Temple - Temple Entrance Shrine, take down Tiger Vanguard and continue up the hill. This will take you to the Yellow Wind Formation - Windrest Bridge Shrine. 

From the shrine, head across the bridge and stick to the left. You will find a set of buildings in the back left corner of the area, before you pass the rat enemies in the middle.

## Where To Use The Sobering Stone in Black Myth: Wukong

The Sobering Stone is a part of the boar man's side quest in Chapter 2 - Yellow Wind Ridge. To get him to move from the Fright Cliff - Rockrest Flat Shrine, you need to hand him the Sobering Stone. From there, you can also hand him a Jade Lotus at Crouching Tiger Temple - Temple Entrance. Finally, returning to his original location with the Arhat Gold Piece in your inventory will cause him to attack you, and defeating him will open up the Kingdom of Sahali and the boss fights: Tiger Vanguard (Kingdom of Sahali) and Fuban.
