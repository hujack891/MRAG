# Goji Shoots

The Goji Shoots is one of the Epic Soaks for your Gourds in Black Myth: Wukong. 

With the Goji Shoots Soak equipped, each use of the Gourd moderately extends the duration of the next Ring of Fire for a short duration 

Soaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Goji Shoots Location

The Goji Shoots can be found in the Upper Hollow area of The Webbed Hollow. From the Shrine, turn around and head up the stairs along the hillside. Continue all the way to the top. At the top you can find a hut with the Soak inside.

Soaks are far more plentiful than the drinks for your gourds. They are scattered throughout the game, across each chapter. For even more guides on these areas, check out our full Black Myth: Wukong walkthrough. You can also keep track of the Awaken Wine Worm locations and Luoija Fragrant Vine locations, which are key to upgrading your healing potential and Gourd.
