# Crafting Materials

Crafting materials are the most important items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong, besides Key Items. These form the core of the entire upgrade and crafting economy in Black Myth: Wukong, from upgrading your equipment, to giving you permanant stat boosts from Xu Dog in Yellow Wind Ridge.
