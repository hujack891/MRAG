# Skandha of Consciousness

The Skandha of Consciousness is the final of the Skandha Key Items you will find in the game. It will allow you to unlock the final big reward at the end of the quest. But, the journey to get it is quite long. 

_"Adaptability alone uncovers significance in subtlety. Once hidden inside the Buddhaâ€™s head, this treasure has a secret yet to be revealed."_  

The Skandha of Consciousness can be found in Mount Huago in Chapter 6. Upon accessing the Cloud ability in this chapter, you can head towards a massive enemy in the distance - the Son of Stones. Fly past this boss, to find a small path leading to the Giant Shigandang. To activate the Giant Shigandang, you will need the other four Skandha items scattered throughout the game: Skandha of Form, Skandha of Thought, Skandha of Choice, and Skandha of Feeling. 

Upon its defeat, you will get this final Skandha item. 

## Where to use the Skandha of Consciousness in Black Myth: Wukong
