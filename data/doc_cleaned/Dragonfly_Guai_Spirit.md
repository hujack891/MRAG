## Dragonfly Guai Location

You will encounter the Dragonfly Guai after defeating Zhu Bajie in the Webbed Hollow. Once you've won the battle, head inside the cave and continue up the path, through another cave, and back out again. Head up the staircase and turn right to see the Dragonfly Guai hovering at the edge of the cliff by some wooden planks.

## Dragonfly Guai Fight

The Dragonfly Guai fights in the air with his bow and poison arrows. The fact that he's flying most of the battle makes it tricky, but you can still reach him with many of your attacks when he's hovering. The Dragonfly Guai does soar higher at times, so be careful when casting Immobilize that you don't accidentally freeze him so high that your attacks can't reach.

  * **Rain of Arrows**
  * Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Qi gained from hits, but significantly reduces Maximum Health, Mana, and Stamina. 

The Dragonfly Guai's Spirit allows you to take the form of the dragonfly and shoot your foes with poisonous arrows. The attack itself is good, but the equipped effect is a double-edged sword, reducing your health, mana, and stamina in return for increasing your Qi.
