# Yin-Yang Daoist Robe

The Yin-Yang Daoist Robe is a Legendary unique piece of Armor and Gear in Black Myth: Wukong. It comes with some solid defense, and a unique ability that no other piece of armor has. 

It has 36 Defense and the following Unique Effect: 

  * When health is above half, the Destined One is in Yang state, which moderately reduces damage taken, but disables critical hits.
  * When health is below half, the Destined One shifts to Yin state, which massively increases critical hit chance but massively increases damage taken

The Yin-Yang Daoist Robe is obtained upon defeating the Keeper of Flaming Mountains in Furnace Valley in Chapter 5 - Flaming Mountains.

Armor can be upgraded, with Silk once you reach Chen Loong and open the Zodiac Realm in The New West in Chapter 3.
