# Jade Lotus Gourd

The Jade Lotus Gourd will likely be the first high-level Gourd you find in Black Myth: Wukong. It is of an Epic variety, and it comes with one of the more unique effects when compared with other Gourds. 

With the Gourd equipped, each sip recovers a considerable amount of health for nearby duplicates if you are using spells like A Pluck of Many. This allows you to both heal yourself based on your Drink choice and your copies. On top of that, the Gourd has 6 uses by default before you have upgraded it at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove in Black Wind Mountain.
