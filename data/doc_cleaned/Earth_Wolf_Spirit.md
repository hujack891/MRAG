## Earth Wolf Location

The Earth Wolf is in Sandgate Village in Yellow Wind Ridge. Follow the path from the Sandgate Village Keeper's Shrine and work your way around to the left, taking out the archers and other enemies as you go. You will eventually circle around to the Earth Wolf's arena, where you can fight for his Spirit. 

## Earth Wolf Fight

The Earth Wolf fight is a challenging one. The Wolf is large, and it hits hard, not to mention it catches fire at some points throughout the battle. Here are the attacks you can expect to see when tussling with the Earth Wolf: 

  * Bite
  * Swipe
  * Charge 
  * Hind Leg Swipe
  * At points throughout the battle the Earth Wolf will start glowing like it's filled with fire. 

The Earth Wolf hits very hard, but winds up a lot of its moves, giving you a chance to dodge out of the way before they hit.

  * **Wild Rapture**
  * Equipped Effect: Grants a small amount of additional Focus on hit. 

The Earth Wolf's Spirit allows you to use the wolf's charge ability to ram and stagger enemies. Even big bosses go down after this move, allowing you to get another combo in before they get up. It's an excellent Spirit and one of the best in the game. You can also use the ability to smash the wall in the First Prince of Flowing Sands arena if the boss doesn't destroy it and reveal the secret area itself.
