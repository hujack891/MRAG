# Bronze Cloud Staff

The Bronze Cloud Staff is another basic weapon you get at the beginning of Black Myth: Wukong. However, it is exclusive to the Deluxe Edition of the game. It comes with slightly improved stats compared to the Willow Wood Staff. Despite that, before long you will want to switch to one of the other Weapons when you get them due to its low damage. 

The weapon has a 36 damage stat, with a decent 2% Critical Hit Chance. While it doesn't have a unique effect, the damage and critical hit chance can give you a slight edge at this point in the game.

With it being exclusive to the Deluxe Edition of the game, you can't craft it. However, it can be found at the first Shrine in Chapter 1 - Black Wind Mountain. Simply pick it up under the "Trailblazer's Gifts" section. 

Weapons can be crafted throughout the game from the Shrines throughout the game's six chapters. Crafting weapons will require Will and various Crafting Materials from the game's locales and enemies.
