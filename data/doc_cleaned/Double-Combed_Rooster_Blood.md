# Double-Combed Rooster Blood

The Double-Combed Rooster Blood is one of the Rare Soaks for your Gourds in Black Myth: Wukong. 

With the Double-Combed Rooster Blood Soak equipped, while in Poisoned state, a sip of your Gourd removes the Poisoned state and moderately increases movement speed and critical hit chance. 

Soaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor.

Soaks are far more plentiful than the drinks for your gourds. They are scattered throughout the game, across each chapter. For even more guides on these areas, check out our full Black Myth: Wukong walkthrough. You can also keep track of the Awaken Wine Worm locations and Luoija Fragrant Vine locations, which are key to upgrading your healing potential and Gourd.
