## Apramana Bat Location

The Apramana Bat can be found along the snowy lake-front in the New West. After exploring Turtle Island and finding yourself on the North Shore of the Bitter Lake, continue down the waterfront until you come across the Apramana Bat near the skeleton of a great snake. The Apramana Bat won't be immediately obvious, but it will slam down to the ground once you get too close.

## Apramana Bat Fight

The Apramana Bat is a massive golden bat that is quite troublesome to fight. This boss frequently launches itself up into the air, crashing back down on you to deal massive damage. It also has an air slice attack where it beats its wings, creating blades of air that rocket toward you. 

Casting immobilize on the Apramana Bat when it's grounded is a good way to get enough time to land some hits before it leaps into the air again, but make sure you don't cast it too early. If you freeze the Apramana Bat in the air, you might not be able to reach it with your attacks.

  * **Frost Blade**
  * Equipped Effect: None

The Apramana Bat Spirit allows you to take the form of the bat, launching yourself up into the air and beating your wings, creating an X-shaped slice of frosty air to damage your target with. This can potentially freeze the target solid if you've dealt enough frost damage beforehand. This is a powerful attack, but the Apramana Bat is the only Spirit without an equipped effect, which is a bit of a downside for this Spirit.
