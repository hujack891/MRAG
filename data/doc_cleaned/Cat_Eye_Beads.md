## Black Myth: Wukong Cat Eye Beads Location

The Cat Eye Beads can be found by killing the Wandering Wight in the Forest of Wolves \- Outside the Forest Shrine area in Black Wind Mountain. The Wight is located along the main path towards Guanyin Temple. 

You need to defeat the Wandering Wight before ringing all three bells in Black Wind Mountain and killing Elder Jinchi. This secret boss in the Ancient Guanyin Temple will despawn the Wandering Wight, making the Beads unobtainable. You can also grab the Wandering Wight Spirit here too upon defeating him. 

The Wandering Wight acts as a skill check boss early in the game, so don't be afraid to come back after you have levelled up, just don't kill Elder Jinchi.
