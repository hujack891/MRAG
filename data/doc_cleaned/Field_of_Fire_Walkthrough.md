# Field of Fire Walkthrough

Field of Fire is the third main area of Chapter 5 in Black Myth: Wukong. Below, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of all the possible bosses there are to defeat in this section, along with conclusions to side quests, and key items to collect. 

  * **Jump to a Section:**
* **Ashen Pass III**
  - Boss Fight - Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai
* **Cooling Slope**
  - Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard
  - Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings
  - Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang
  - Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart
* **Fallen Furnace Crater**
  - Yaoguai King - Red Boy
  - Yaoguai King - Yaksha King

After defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the Yin-Yang Fish, and the Crimson-Silver Cart, you'll have climbed to the top of the Flaming Mountains and be closer to finding out where the Bull King is. 

## Ashen Pass III

![Field Fire Walkthrough .png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2f/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_.png)

Before you continue along the path, face the Ashen Pass III Keeper's Shrine and turn to the right. You'll see a Purple Lingzhi to harvest and another mushroom in the center of the clearing. When you pull this second one, you'll be confronted by the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai, which is an optional boss. 

### Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(2\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4a/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%282%29.png)

The huge Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai will emerge as soon as you attempt to harvest the mushroom. Immediately, he'll leap up and try to hit you. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(3\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e9/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%283%29.png)

He uses a spiked mace to attack and generally will perform a series of combos where he'll swing the mace, or leap up in the air and smash it down. 

Though these are fairly standard attacks, in the sense that they can be dodged and evaded, the problem with them is the small red mushrooms that appear with each one. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(4\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d3/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%284%29.png)

These tiny red mushrooms will appear in any area that his attack lands -- including on you. If they start to grow on you, they'll reduce your movement significantly. This doesn't affect dodging, however, just walking. The biggest problem with this is that as you move around, the red mushrooms will appear on the floor around you and continue to explode, so you'll need to keep moving. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(6\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ee/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%286%29.png)

When they land in areas of the clearing, they will explode into a red mist. This is poisonous, so you'll want to evade the direct blows from the mace and the fungi to avoid poison buildup. Be sure to have Antimiasma Powder equipped to help with any poison buildup during this fight. 

![Field of Fire Walkthrough \(1\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/15/Field_of_Fire_Walkthrough_%281%29.png)

At times, he will also throw his cap and it acts like a boomerang. This is his only ranged attack, and it will try to hit you from behind, so again, keep moving to avoid this. 

Once you've beaten him, be sure to collect the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai Spirit that he leaves behind. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(8\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/24/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%288%29.png)

Just beyond the clearing where you'll fight the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai, you'll also find The Crag Meditation Spot. You can get this before or after the fight. Just before it, there's another Purple Lingzhi that can be harvested -- don't worry, this won't be another enemy. 

Return to the Ashen Pass III Keeper's Shrine, and continue on the path opposite it. You'll reach a portion of the path where it narrows, and there's a Searing-Fire enemy to the right. However, the bigger problem you'll have is the spiked golden ball you can see straight up ahead. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(11\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/43/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2811%29.png)

You're about to get quite familiar with this ball, as it will follow you along the path for a while. It will roll back and forth over a small portion of the path each time, but if it hits you just once, it's game over. 

The aim of this section is to find little alcoves or wider sections of the path, so you can dip into them and stay out of the ball's line of fire. 

**Here are some tips for completing this section:**

  * **Look for where the enemies are along the path.** Typically, this is where the path is wider or there's a place you can stop and wait.
  * **Watch where the ball is rolling to see where it starts and ends.** This changes as you make your way along the path, so it's always worth waiting for a second and seeing the length of the path the ball covers while it's rolling before you run.
  * **Use Cloudstep.** On the longer sections, where it seems like a mad dash to try and reach the next point, use Cloudstep to cover the ground quicker. 
  * **Whenever you can, back enemies into the path of the ball.** They're not immune to the attacks, so it can make light work of them saving you the hassle. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(10\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9e/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2810%29.png)

In the first section, go right and into the dip with the Searing-Fire. Wait until the ball rolls past, then dash forward and to the left, where a Flamling will appear. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(13\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/93/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2813%29.png)

When it's safe to move on, go up and to the right, to find the next alcove with a Searing-Fire. This is the next alcove you'll want to jump in, then it'll be another dip with a Searing-Fire enemy 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(15\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/67/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2815%29.png)

As the ball breaks through, get ready to run to the next section on the left. This one will be empty of any enemies. Continue forward, and it's another gap on the left you'll be dashing into. This time, there will be a green Wisp, and a bit further up, there's a Searing-Fire waiting for you. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(16\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f3/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2816%29.png)

Grab the green Wisp, and let the ball deal with the Searing-Fire, as you make your way up and to the right, where you'll find a Turtle Treasure guarding a chest. Take down the Turtle Treasure and open the chest to grab Knot of Voidness, medicines, and gold. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(18\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c9/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2818%29.png)

Continue on the path, where you'll be jumping into a gap on the left just before the flames -- a Flamling will appear as you get there. Pay close attention to this wall of flames on the right, because we'll be coming back here soon. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(19\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1c/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2819%29.png)

The ball will burst through now to cover another portion of the path, so dash forward and head to the left again, where you'll find a Purple Lingzhi to harvest. Ignore the Scorching Flame enemy, as the ball will take care of this. 

As the ball breaks through even further, run with it. You want it to be as far forward as it can go before you go up and to the gap on the left. Another Searing-Flame will appear here, and then you'll find a gap very close to you on the right, with yet another Searing-Flame. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(12\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/64/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2812%29.png)

The gauntlet is almost over! As you continue on, there's a small gap on the left you can dart into and then it's onward toward the flames. When you approach, a cutscene will begin where you'll see the golden spiked ball go flying off the end of the cliff. 

After the cutscene, ignore Pingping running off, and turn back to where you came from. Remember the wall of flames? Head back there. Now that the ball is gone, it's safe to explore the area slowly and you'll find the flames have also disappeared. A path has been revealed, which is the Cooling Slope, and the next place we'll explore. 

## Cooling Slope

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(20\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/97/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2820%29.png)

As you enter the Cooling Slope for the first time, there are two points of interest to take note of. Up ahead, there's a smattering of rocks. And to the left, there's a Luoija Fragrant Vine. 

If you hug the rocks to the left, you can collect the Luoija Fragrant Vine safely, but be careful as a Searing-Fire will leap out at you as you get close to it.

Then, you'll want to go over to that collection of rocks. When you approach, it will transform into your first miniboss of the region, which is the Flint Vanguard. 

### Don't Miss This Spirit!

Once the golden spiked ball has flown off the edge of the Ashen Pass, return to The Emerald Hall. Go past the altar and up the path toward the Ashen Pass. Once you've climbed the first set of stairs, you'll see the golden ball wedged into a rock next to the Flame Rhino Master. ![Field Fire Walkthrough \(23\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/23/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2823%29.png) Go all the way up to it and you'll be able to take the Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top Spirit from inside. 

Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top Spirit

### Yaoguai Chief - Flint Vanguard

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(21\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5a/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2821%29.png)

The fight with the Flint Vanguard is sadly not a one-on-one as Searing and Scorching-Fire enemies will accompany it. These will emerge as soon as you approach, and it's worth clearing them out first so you don't have to think about them while attacking the Flint Vanguard. To do this, run around the outskirts of the Flint Vanguard and bait the creatures into attacking you, then run into the middle of the rock circle to bring out the miniboss. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(22\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3c/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2822%29.png)

When it comes to the Flint Vanguard, the main thing to watch out for is its thick rocky arms. It will punch down using these, creating pools of lava where they land. To counter these attacks, use Body-Cooling Powder and your Fireproof Mantle. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(25\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5c/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2825%29.png)

Whenever you're close to the Flint Vanguard, it will go into combo punches. These are typical punches to the ground, and occasionally it will slam both arms down together. These can be dodged, and you'll be able to keep close to the Vanguard temporarily until pools of lava appear -- that's when you want to dash away. 

It shifts to ranged attacks when you try to create distance, in the form of fireballs. This will just be a single shot each time, so it's easiest to dodge. It will also attempt to close the gap by flying over to you and smashing down. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(24\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f3/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2824%29.png)

When it starts to get enranged, it will slam its fists down and shake its head, sending out a barrage of fireballs. Run around when this occurs, to avoid as much of the fireballs as possible. 

Generally, you want to stick close to the Vanguard, dodge the punches, and build up focus to perform heavy attacks. You can knock it over like this, where it will be on all fours, so you can target it while it's vulnerable. 

![B1 19 09 2024 16 00 13 copy.png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/32/B1_19_09_2024_16_00_13_copy.png)

When the Flint Vanguard is down, be sure to collect the Flint Vanguard Spirit it drops. There's also a green Wisp you can pick up, that's just to the left of the clearing. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(27\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/98/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2827%29.png)

After the fight, take the path that slopes down behind the area where you fought the Flint Vanguard. You'll encounter some more of the Searing and Scorching-Flame enemies, as well as a little green Wisp to the right, by the lava lake. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(26\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/aa/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2826%29.png)

As you head into the next barren section, you may notice the glow of a treasure chest up ahead. Be warned that there are also little glowing patches leading up to, and inside the next clearing, and these are all Flamlings. Clear them out before you go over to the chest, where you can collect Refined Iron Sand from it. 

When you've looted the chest, go around to the other side of the rock. There will be an open clearing here, that looks like it's empty. Again, remove any Flamlings from the area, then go to the center of the clearing. Here you'll find a larger glowing patch. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(33\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c5/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2833%29.png)

This is actually where you can summon a miniboss called the Mother of Flamlings, and to do so, all you need to give over is 4x Flame Ores. Thankfully, Flame Ores are dropped by Flamlings, so you'll hopefully have enough by this point to summon her immediately. Approach the glowing patch and deliver the Flame Ores. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Mother of Flamlings

The ground will rumble as the Mother of Flamlings appears, and fireballs will be thrown out as soon as she bursts through the ground. Stand back after delivering the Flame Ores to avoid this attack. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(35\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1f/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2835%29.png)

These will land on the ground and turn into glowing patches. Unfortunately, these will become Flamlings, so be mindful of these as you run around the arena. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(34\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/26/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2834%29.png)

The Mother of Flamlings, thankfully, won't move. She'll stay where she is and use ranged fireball attacks, very similar to the Flamlings. To combat this, get as close to her as possible and try to land a few attacks. The downside of this, however, is that she will try to whip you with her body. If you can dodge these, she'll smack herself into the ground and be temporarily stunned. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(32\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/06/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2832%29.png)

After hitting her a few times, she'll be frustrated and scream. This is when the Flamlings will emerge and begin to shoot fireballs immediately. You'll want to clear these out as fast as you can and use your Fireproof Mantle and Body-Cooling Powder to counter any fire damage you might experience. 

When you've cleared out the first round of Flamlings, she'll reappear. This round of attacks will repeat until she's been defeated, except she can reappear when Flamlings are still in the arena after the first round. Still, the priority should be to remove them first before focusing on her. 

After the Mother of Flamlings fight, pick up the Mother of Flamlings Spirit and then continue on the path down the Cooling Slope. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(39\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c5/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2839%29.png)

On the right, you'll find a tree where you can harvest a Fire Date just after a Scorching-Fire enemy. Be careful of the Flamling that will emerge as you go up to it. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(40\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/db/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2840%29.png)

Proceed past this, and look to the left to find a Tenner guarding a chest. Take the enemy down, open the chest to collect Fine Gold Thread and a Mind Core, and continue down the slope. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(42\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/64/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2842%29.png)

Go past the lone Searing-Fire rock and you'll reach the Cooling Slope Keeper's Shrine. Keep going forward past the Keeper's Shrine and look to the right. You'll see an icy archway, and a clear just before it. Head over here, past the Scorching-Fire rocks, and you'll come face to face with the final of the Five Element Carts. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Rusty-Gold Cart

![Chapter 5 Secret Area \(8\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d2/Chapter_5_Secret_Area_%288%29.png)

Let the cutscene play out as you approach and see the Pale-Axe Stalwart from the mouth of the cart, and then be prepared to use everything you've got against the most aggressive coffin cart of the Chapter. 

It will combine the movesets from the previous three carts you've encountered and add its own to the mix. While some moves will seem familiar, others you'll need to learn to avoid. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(28\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4c/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2828%29.png)

Use Immobilize when you can to stop it from zooming around and follow up with combo attacks quickly. Landing heavy attacks in this manner will knock the cart down, leaving it vulnerable to further follow-up attacks. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(30\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bd/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2830%29.png)

The way the cart plays with fire will also differ. It will spin around while spewing fire from the front to try and get you. When this happens, stick close to it and spin with it. If you get caught with this move, throw on the Fireproof Mantle to negate some of the fire damage. Another variation you'll see is it spitting fireballs. For this move, it will aim the fireballs and spit them out, and you can dash out of the way to miss them entirely. 

Lastly is the difference in punches. The cart will lunge and take swipes at you but also punch the ground like the other carts. To make things trickier, it will also try to grab you. 

When it does go to take a swipe at you, try to roll toward it. You'll either end up going underneath it or to the side of it and dodging the attack. 

![Chapter 5 Secret Area \(12\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/51/Chapter_5_Secret_Area_%2812%29.png)

When you've beaten the final cart, you'll receive the Flame Orb Curio. Head over to the area on the right before the doorway and speak to the Pale-Axe Stalwart one final time. 

After the conversation and the cutscene, you can then approach the frozen-over entrance and break through to head inside. 

This doorway will take you to the chapter's secret area called the Bishui Cave. We'd recommend completing this before you finish up the chapter. But there's one last miniboss to fight before you teleport to the secret area. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(43\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/99/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2843%29.png)

As you head inside the cave, go down the slope. You'll see a large structure in the center of the room that's being hit by the light. This is what will teleport you to Bishui Cave, but first, you'll want to look to the left. Here you can find the fifth of the frog bosses in the game, called Baw-Lang-Lang. 

### Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Lang-Lang

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(36\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d6/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2836%29.png)

Much like other bosses in this Chapter, Baw-Lang-Lang favors fire attacks. And much like the other frog bosses, you'll see the same set of moves from Baw-Lang-Lang that include the tongue whip and leaping. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(37\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b3/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2837%29.png)

When Baw-Lang-Lang whips its tongue, it will be coated in fire. The frog will whip it left to right, or shoot it straight out at you. You can jump over its tongue or dodge the attacks. 

You'll then find it uses a leaping attack, where it swipes at you twice and then leaps up and over to you, to try and catch you. When it lands, a little burst of fire will emerge from underneath it. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(38\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/58/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2838%29.png)

Changes in its attack pattern will begin around the halfway mark, and it will lean up toward the top of the cave and spit fireballs all around it. Hang back as far as you can when this happens to avoid them. 

It will then start to breathe fire from its mouth as a jet, in which case, you'll want to get behind it and attack. Lastly, you'll see a change in its leap attacks. Wherever it jumps, it will send out small waves of fire in a circle around it. As you see it leaping, dodge and create distance between the two of you to avoid the circle of flames. 

When you've defeated Baw-Lang-Lang, approach the tall structure in the center of the room to be transported to Bishui Cave. 

**See** **Chapter 5 Secret - Bishui Cave Walkthroughfor a detailed breakdown of how to complete the chapter's hidden area.**

When you return from the cave, go back up the Cooling Slope and toward the area where the golden spiked ball flew off the edge of the cliff. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(44\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a7/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2844%29.png)

Collect the green Wisps from the far edge on the left, then follow the path where the fox went toward the Bull King. This will take you down a path that leads up to the Bull King, and where you can find the next Keeper's Shrine called Fallen Furnace Crater. 

## Fallen Furnace Crater

![FIeld Fire Walkthrough \(46\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5b/FIeld_Fire_Walkthrough_%2846%29.png)

Head up the slope to see Pingping speak to her father. The Bull King isn't best pleased with The Destined One, but also has an issue with Pingping and her deception. It turns out that Pingping is actually the Red Boy, and he will transform before your eyes, ready for a battle. 

### Yaoguai King - Red Boy

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(48\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ec/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2848%29.png)

The Red Boy is incredibly agile, and he'll move quickly around the clearing, twisting and turning to lunge at you using his spear. However, his combos are thankfully short, so you'll only need to dodge a couple of times to avoid these swiping attacks and be able to follow up with your own. 

That being said, if you're lucky, you'll experience moments where he actually stands still for a few seconds, preparing to attack. Take advantage of these opportunities when they present themselves, to get in as many hits as possible before he starts a combo of fire assaults. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(53\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/95/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2853%29.png)

When he does stand still -- or he's pausing from his own combos -- you won't be able to finish a combo of your own. It's best to just get a few hits in, then immediately jump back. This is because he'll breathe fire in a small arc directly in front of him as soon as you've hit him a few times. 

As you'd expect from the final boss of The Flaming Mountains, the Red Boy uses a weapon imbued with fire and projectile fire attacks. For this reason, we'd recommend you stock up on Body-Cooling Powder and equip your Fireproof Mantle to help you should you start to take too much elemental damage. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(52\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c2/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2852%29.png)

When he winds his staff to create a ring of fire, the attack looks a lot worse than it actually is. He'll throw out the ring toward you and it will start to bounce around the clearing. Keep track of it by looking up and following it to stay away from where it lands. If you keep moving, it's fairly easy to avoid. After bouncing around a few times, the Red Boy will slam down into the ground to recover the spear. There's a brief pause here while he composes himself, so you'll be able to rush in to attack. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(49\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/84/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2849%29.png)

If he performs the combination of moves where he twirls the spear around him, he'll perform a leap and thrust his spear into the ground, then flip toward you. When he does this, he'll follow it up immediately with a flamethrower from his hand. It's best to dodge all of this moveset, then attack. 

Though it's tempting to create distance, it's better to stay close to the Red Boy during this fight. Not only will this allow you to take advantage of those pauses we mentioned previously, but it also means he's less likely to use projectiles. If you're too far away, he'll shoot fire along the ground to try and reach you. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(51\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/08/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2851%29.png)

When his health reaches the halfway point, he'll launch himself up in the air. Shortly after, he'll create duplicates of himself that will appear all around him. These will launch themselves at you with their spears, resulting in an explosion. It'll start with one duplicate launching themselves at you, then two, and finally, a set of three will attack. 

The best way to approach this is to stay locked on the Red Boy, but move as far back in the area as you can. If you need to, use any rocks nearby that haven't been destroyed. You can then dodge in any direction to evade the attacks and do a quick double tap of dodge when you have multiple duplicates coming at you. If you're finding it difficult to dodge the attacks, Cloudstep can help you direct some of the attention away from yourself. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(50\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/25/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2850%29.png)

Once the duplicates are gone, he will immediately follow with a strong attack. Most of his attacks can actually be interrupted by your own heavy attack, so try to build focus with cautious half-combos or equip items that will let you gain it quickly. Performing heavy attacks will stagger him and stop him from going into certain moves entirely if timed right.

When he's back down on the floor after sending out the duplicates, his attacks will be way more aggressive and he'll be more agile. You'll find that he repeats the same variations of attack, they'll just have a wider reach. For example, he'll spin his spear for longer, resulting in fire emerging around him, and then will leave areas of the ground covered in flames. 

You can approach the second part of the fight in much the same way you did the first, and if you haven't used too many spells, now is the time to unleash them and get the rest of his health down as soon as possible. 

After being the Red Boy, the Bull King will reveal the stone that was kept in his belly. At the end of the conversation, the Red Boy's body will begin to disappear. But before The Destined One can collect the stone, the Red Boy emerges, showing that he used a False Death Talisman and is actually alive. He consumes the stone and immediately transforms into the Yaksha King. 

### Yaoguai King - Yaksha King

If you die during this phase, you do not need to fight the Red Boy again.

The Yaksha King will draw two blades from his elbows, which will be angled behind him for the fight. These will glow brightly, and he'll use them traditionally as blades, but also be able to throw our circular projectiles from them.

Zhu Bajie will be helping you out at the start of this fight, so you can use him as a distraction while you get some hits in. It's also wise to try and hold off on healing as much as you can and allow Zhu Bajie to do this for you instead. 

When the Yaksha King begins to throw out those circular projectiles, you'll find that these often are around 4-5 at a time. It's best to dodge them by rolling forward, toward the Yaksha King, so you can immediately attack as the last one is dashed.

The move that feels like his signature for the fight is one where small blades emerge from the floor (almost grass-like). They are incredibly visible, but they'll only stick out slightly from the ground when he starts to perform the attack. When you see them, you'll have a few seconds to get away from the ring of blades, because they'll shoot up as full-blown spikes in no time. 

While it's easy to avoid this move at first, he has another variation that will cover a larger amount of the arena. This will begin with one circle of blades appearing, and then a second one forming as an extension. In this case, you can jump or dodge to avoid the attacks, but the timing of this can be difficult, so running from the area is the most straightforward way to not get caught in this.

You'll also find that he performs acrobatics around the arena, and will run up the wall occasionally. When he does this, he'll flip off of the rocks and try to land on you. As he lands, he will also send the blades up from the ground, along with rocks.

After knocking down a chunk of his health, there will be times when he starts to switch to using just one blade. You'll know when this is about to happen, as only one blade will glow brightly, while the other will be dimmed. When he does this, this will mean that the blade will be able to reach much further, and he'll create huge extended arcs with it. He often does this in chains of three and will start to say a word like "Merciless" or "Sheathless" before each attack. You'll want to learn the timings of this attack, so you can dodge and roll right underneath it each time.

In the second part of the fight, he'll become much more aggressive. This will also be when Zhu Bajie leaves the fight. He won't only swing the blade around himself like he did in the first portion of the fight, but he'll also swing the sword overhead and land it down in front of him. When he does this, he'll send out a trail of the grass-like blades. You can dodge the long arcs in the same way you did for the first part of the fight, and dodge side to side to avoid the trail of blades.

There's one particular attack in this second half of the fight where he'll charge at you. You'll need to dodge this, otherwise, he'll grab you and a short cutscene will begin. The Yaksha King will pummel The Destined One, and when you restart the fight, you'll see a significant chunk of your health gone. 

![Field Fire Walkthrough \(65\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/53/Field_Fire_Walkthrough_%2865%29.png)

You can approach this fight in a similar way to the Red Boy, in that it's best to save your spells until the second portion. Immobilize works on him, so when he's darting around more in the second half, you can trap him and make it easier to attack. Ebon Flow is also a good spell to use in this fight, as you can block his attacks with the defense option and build up focus to unleash heavy attacks to stagger him. 

With the Yaksha King defeated, Zhu Bajie will get him to spit out the relic. Chapter 5 comes to an end with Rakshasi appearing and promising to never leave the mountain again, and handing over the Plantain Fan to the Destined One. 

With the chapter's end, you'll earn the Grieved Body, and the talents you can pick from it are: 

  * **Nimble Body -** Massively reduces the Stamina cost of all charged Heavy Attacks.
  * **Everlasting Vitality -** Considerably increases Maximum Health.
  * **Divine Safeguard -** Considerably increases Four Banes Resistance.

It's time to venture to Mount Huago to start the final chapter of Black Myth: Wukong.
