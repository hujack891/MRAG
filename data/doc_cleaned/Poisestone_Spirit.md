## Poisestone Location

Poisestone is lurking in the cave at Rockrest Flat. To find Poisestone, head into the cave directly opposite the Rockrest Flat Keeper's Shrine and turn right almost immediately upon entering. Follow that path around to find the Mother of all Stones guarded by the Poisestone and several other rock enemies.

## Poisestone Fight

Poisestone fights like all of the other enemies of her type in Black Myth: Wukong. Her main methods of attack are kick-based, and they hit extremely hard. Thankfully, most of her attacks can be avoided with well-timed Perfect Dodges. Be careful when you knock Poisestone down that she is actually dead. Some rock enemies have a habit of passing out for a bit before getting back up to continue fighting.

  * **Strike at Heart**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases the Damage of Jump Light Attacks and reduces the Stamina cost of Sprinting. 

Poisestone's Spirit is quite a good one for multiple reasons. For one, it is a double-pronged attack that deals damage both with an initial kick to the chest as well as inflicting area damage when you land. The equipped effect is also excellent and both increases Light Attack damage while reducing Sprinting Stamina cost. Even when you're not actively using the Poisestone's skill, you are still getting those two equip buffs which can make a big difference in both combat and exploration.
