# Endings Explained

Black Myth: Wukong has two endings and you can experience both in one playthrough if you complete them in the right order. One is the ending that happens naturally at the end of the game but is considered the bad ending, while the other is a secret ending only achieved by finding and completing several hidden areas and a side quest. On this page, we'll detail what both of the endings mean for The Destined One. 

## Spoiler Warning

As we discuss the endings of the game, this page will naturally contain spoilers. Just in case you've ended up on this page by accident, now is your warning and your chance to click away!

## The Story So Far

Black Myth: Wukong begins with Wukong fighting Erlang, The Sacred Divinity, and the Heavenly Kings. Despite putting up a good fight, Erlang and the kings are too strong, and Wukong runs off to the woods. 

Erlang manages to catch up to Wukong and causes him to fall. And so, at the top of a mountain, Sun Wukong's story comes to an end and he's shown trapped inside of a rock. 

We cut to The Old Monkey teaching a group about the tales of Sun Wukong, and he mentions the six relics where Wukong split himself. There is just one monkey who can venture through the lands to try and collect each of the Six Senses of the Great Sage, known as The Destined One. 

## Ending 1 - The (Bad) Default Ending

To get this ending, you can complete all aspects of the game, **except for the hidden area of Mount Mei in The Great Pagoda**. With these conditions, you'll automatically unlock the bad ending after the final boss fight in Chapter 6.

When you've beaten The Great Sage's Broken Shell, you'll see Wukong collapse in the water and the six senses leave its body.

These will be absorbed by The Destined One, who will kneel down face to face with Wukong. Despite obtaining all the Great Sage's Six Senses, and besting Wukong, a crown falls into the water.

As The Old Monkey collects the golden crown from the water, he places it on top of The Destined One's head. Unfortunately, this does nothing but place The Destined One inside the same rock that Wukong laid waiting. 

## Ending 2 - The (True) Secret Ending

To reveal the secret and true ending of the game, you'll need to travel to The Great Pagoda in Chapter 3 and unlock Mount Mei. You can find out more about how to unlock Mount Mei and the secret ending here. 

This will see you face off against Erlang, The Sacred Divinity, The Four Heavenly Kings, and Erlang Shen. After winning the battle against them, you'll need to return to fight the Stone Monkey and The Great Sage's Broken Shell. 

You'll see the exact same cutscene for this ending, where Wukong falls to his knees and loses the Six Senses from his body only for The Destined One to absorb them.

The difference with this ending, however, is that when the gold crown drops into the water, and The Old Monkey picks it up and places it on The Destined One's head, there will be a flash where The Destined One opens his eyes.

You'll then see an illustration of Wukong's life, starting with him fighting Erlang. As The Destined One is not shown inside the rock before the credits roll, it suggests that The Destined One was worthy all along and that the cycle begins anew.
