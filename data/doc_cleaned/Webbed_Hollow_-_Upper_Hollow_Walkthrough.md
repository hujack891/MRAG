# Webbed Hollow - Upper Hollow Walkthrough

The Webbed Hollow is the second main area of Black Myth: Wukong's Chapter 4, starting with the upper portion of the large underground cave system. Below you'll find a guide for the first upper area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find your first encounter with the Venom Daoist, and the different ways to reach The Verdure Bridge.

* **Pool of Shattered Jade**

Due to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow. 

## Webbed Hollow

![Wukong UpperHollow 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9f/Wukong_UpperHollow_1.jpg)

After facing certain doom trapped in the web of the spider guais of this realm, the Destined One will suddenly awake safe in a bed, somewhere deep underground below the Lanxi Village. 

Once you are up again, you'll find a helpful gold box has been placed by the bed, and you can open the small **Treasure Chest** to claim 3 Antimiasma Powder and 1 Longevity Decoction. If you can't take the hint, it means you're likely to run into a lot of poison-inducing enemies in this area. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b1/Wukong_UpperHollow_2.jpg)

Before following the golden trail of a nearby Shrine, look to the left of the bed and small chest to find a path leading to another larger **Treasure Chest** you can open to claim a **Cuo Jin-Yin Belt Hook Curio** , another item that can help resist all the poison you'll be encountering. 

## Upper Hollow

![Wukong UpperHollow 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/65/Wukong_UpperHollow_3.jpg)

Head back up the main path to find the Upper Hollow Shrine as you finally take in the breadth of this new region. Unlike the village above, this sprawling area just goes deeper and deeper underground, and is full of alternate pathways and twisting passages leading to the lower levels. Be sure to also check your weapons to craft a new Chitin Staff from defeating The Second Sister. 

![Wukong UpperHollow X.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/aa/Wukong_UpperHollow_X.jpg)  
Note - You can actually warp back to the Zhu Estate in the previous area to find the village in a different light. From some reason it will be daylight when you return, and nearly all the enemies will be gone, save for a Lantern Holder that opened the door for you where you fought the Second Sister. Defeat this lone foe, and you'll be able to claim the Lantern Holder Spirit! 

The Upper Hollow area consists of a small group of houses to the left, and a larger pathway to the right that rings around the level, providing multiple points to drop down to the lower level. The main path rings around to the right of the shrine, so we'll check out the other side first. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/75/Wukong_UpperHollow_4.jpg)

Straight ahead from the Shrine, you'll find a Puppet Tick overlooking the cliff past some houses. A sloping path to the left leads down to a broken bridge with a green Wisp to absorb, and a nearby shack has a **Treasure Chest** full of materials guarded by a Puppet Spider and various Stone Spiders. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7a/Wukong_UpperHollow_5.jpg)

Head up the stone stairs back up the slope to find more houses and a green Wisp behind one, with a Lantern Holder out front. Here's a series of stairs leading even higher up from here, leading to a large walled gate. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9c/Wukong_UpperHollow_6.jpg)

As you head through the gate, look on the other side for a small **Turtle Chest** , and inside you'll find a **Goji Shoots Soak** for your Gourd! 

![Wukong UpperHollow 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/20/Wukong_UpperHollow_7.jpg)

Beyond the wall, you can find a thin ledge leading along the rocky cave wall guarded by a Dragonfly Guai peppering you with poison arrows. After you cross the gap, you can spot torches up the wall on the right, and a lower path to the left leading back down to an overlook for the Upper Hollow Shrine, complete with a green Wisp to absorb along the ledge. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8f/Wukong_UpperHollow_8.jpg)

Just to the right of this ledge, there's a small cave lined with tiny cocoons everywhere, and a few medium-sized cocoons that will burst to reveal ugly looking Minor Amourworms. They can't do too much other than thrash about or lunge (a surprisingly long distance in a short span), but the one you'll want to worry about is the larger cocoon in the middle that holds a Lesser Amourworm. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5c/Wukong_UpperHollow_9.jpg)

He's much bigger than the rest, meaning his thrashing does more damage, but you can still attack safely from a distance with the Thrust Stance. Behind the larger worm, you'll find a reward in the form of **Treasure Chest** that holds assorted materials. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/09/Wukong_UpperHollow_10.jpg)

Finally, you can head up the torch-lit path outside this cave guarded by many Stone Spiders. At the end of the path is a small gap leading to a room that seems to be an entrance pit of some sort, as a large green Wisp floats above a bed of cobwebs. In fact, if you return to the Zhu Estate above and try jumping in the pit again, you'll end up in this very spot! 

![Wukong UpperHollow 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/76/Wukong_UpperHollow_11.jpg)

Returning to the Upper Hollow Shrine, look for a small stone stair path up to the right past the shack, leading across to a large area brimming with assorted cocoons. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/28/Wukong_UpperHollow_13.jpg)  
A note on cocoons: you'll encounter many of these throughout the Webbed Hollow, in various shapes and sizes. Some contain enemies and will wriggle about as you approach, but it is sometimes possible to attack the cocoon fast enough to stop whatever is inside from emerging. The smaller cocoons don't have yaoguais within, but do provide Will when broken. Even better, this area is likely to give you up to three **Rice Cocoons** when breaking a random tiny cocoon, and one or more **Spine in the Sack Curios** when breaking slightly larger cocoons, so they're worth destroying as you progress! 

![Wukong UpperHollow 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a9/Wukong_UpperHollow_12.jpg)

Watch out for a few Grasshopper Guai trapped in some of the larger cocoons as you approach a large hole in the middle of the path with an archer on the far side. There's actually a wooden ledge near here that offers one of two ways to drop down to a lower level, but we'll backtrack to this spot later since it's a lengthy and one-way trip. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cd/Wukong_UpperHollow_14.jpg)

Grab the green Wisp near where the archer was posted, and continue on through another large cave full of more cocoons, with some Puppet Ticks tending to them, and a few Wasp Guai stuck in the cocoons. They can be a little tricky to pin down with their constant darting around, so either bait them into diving into a Rock Solid, or use your Thrust or Pillar Stance to knock them out of the air. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0d/Wukong_UpperHollow_15.jpg)

As you near the end of the passage, keep your eyes on the right to spot a small alcove where the glow of a green Wisp will entice you over to investigate. There's a few Puppet Spiders waiting to ambush you when you draw close, however. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b8/Wukong_UpperHollow_16.jpg)

In the next passage, a Puppet Tick walks among more cocoons and Stone Spiders that will sprout up, while a Dragonfly Guai on a ledge nearby will try to fill you with poison while your distracted. Try to prioritize him first either by sprinting or Cloud Stepping over to him. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/46/Wukong_UpperHollow_17.jpg)

Finally, the cave passage will open up on the left, but there's one more section to check straight ahead. The smaller path leads to a room with a Beetle Captain guarding a Treasure Chest on a higher ledge. The captain will be tougher to beat, so be ready for his quick flitting movements and try to anticipate his charges to deflect with Rock Solid, or pin him in place with Immobilize. Defeating him will allow you to gain the Beetle Captain Spirit, while the **Treasure Chest** on the ledge holds a Gold Tree Core, Mind Core, and other random materials. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5b/Wukong_UpperHollow_18.jpg)

Take the other path leading out of the cave-like passage, where you'll find a Lantern Holder waiting along with the Puppet Spider dangling above. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9f/Wukong_UpperHollow_19.jpg)

You'll now find yourself on the opposite side of the Hollow from where you first started, with a group of platforms in front of you that offer a one-way ticket down to the start of the Middle Hollow and the Verdure Bridge. However, going down there now would cause to a miss a large optional area complete with a boss (but you can drop down early to grab the Shrine and warp back up if you want). 

## Pool of Shattered Jade

![Wukong UpperHollow 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/10/Wukong_UpperHollow_20.jpg)

Return back to the first large area filled with cocoons to the right of the Upper Hollow Shrine, and look for the pit in the middle with a wooden platform ledge you can use to drop down to a slightly lower floor. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/87/Wukong_UpperHollow_21.jpg)

A Puppet Spider will be waiting for you down here, as well as a green Wisp off in a darkened ledge. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/ff/Wukong_UpperHollow_22.jpg)

Take the opposite path from the ledge to enter a passageway with a disturbing sight: Tons and tons of hanging cocoons that block your progress. As you approach, several of these will spring to life with large talons, and begin to wobble back and forth while violently swiping. To make matters worse, it's not easy to target the aggressive Clawed Cocoons vs the other ones that can also be knocked around. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ae/Wukong_UpperHollow_23.jpg)

To make things a bit easier and safer (as long as you don't mind taking your time), we recommend simply charging up your Thrust Stance and expending 2 focus points to deal with any swinging threats immediately, and then beating around the empty cocoons like pinatas to better see the path ahead (and gain Will). 

![Wukong UpperHollow 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/62/Wukong_UpperHollow_24.jpg)

As you clear a path through the room, keep an eye on the wall to the right, and you should find a group of hanging cocoons blocking a small alcove. Inside, you'll find a **Treasure Chest** with random materials, but also a Beetle Captain that will burst out of a nearby cocoon! 

![Wukong UpperHollow 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0f/Wukong_UpperHollow_25.jpg)

Make your way to the end of the hanging cocoon passageway, and rush the Dragonfly Guai archer up ahead. There's another green Wisp to absorb along the ledge before heading into the next cave tunnel. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1f/Wukong_UpperHollow_26.jpg)

Up ahead you'll find... more hanging cocoons, and yes, many of them hide Clawed Cocoons. Thankfully, the passage isn't as big, but it does hide a few Puppet Spiders to throw into the mix, so don't panic and dive into the middle of the group. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3f/Wukong_UpperHollow_27.jpg)

On the other side, you'll find a stairway leading up to a long curved path in a large open room, with giant beams along the ceiling from which Puppet Spiders dangle. It's a good idea to pause here a moment, because there's a patrolling enemy who is a lot to deal with, you won't want to fight him with his friends. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/17/Wukong_UpperHollow_28.jpg)

The Scorpion Prince attacks with one giant claw, and his large poisonous stinger on his back, and each can be painful in their own right. He'll often charge at you with his claw and drag it through the floor to fling it upwards, or pounce at you from range, while following up with a tail swipe and second claw attack. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d0/Wukong_UpperHollow_29.jpg)

When he goes to favor his tail, he'll perform a poisonous uppercut slash, then slam his tail down twice in quick succession, before a delayed final strike. Luckily this usually leaves him winded enough for you to get off a charged hit. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7f/Wukong_UpperHollow_30.jpg)

The good news is he won't respawn, so go all out with baiting his lunges to deflect with Rock Solid, and transform as needed to dish out as much damage as possible to send him sprawling. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/55/Wukong_UpperHollow_32.jpg)

Once he's defeated, you can lure down the first of several Puppet Spiders just past the stairs, but be sure to also turn around to find a small path up to an alcove with a green Wisp, and a ledge that will drop you back into the hanging cocoon passage. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/04/Wukong_UpperHollow_31.jpg)

Continue up the long rounded path luring out the Puppet Spiders one at a time, and eventually you'll reach the far side of the large platform you saw across from the houses near the Upper Hollow Shrine. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a2/Wukong_UpperHollow_33.jpg)

The Pool of Shattered Jade Shrine can be found here, along with a **Meditation Spot** in the middle of the pool. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2d/Wukong_UpperHollow_34.jpg)

Grab the green Wisp on this side of the broken bridge, and then look past the Shrine for a small passageway full of -- you guessed it -- hanging cocoons. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/47/Wukong_UpperHollow_35.jpg)

Carefully carve a path through the Clawed Cocoons to reach the other side, and you'll find yourself in a large chamber with an even bigger cocoon hanging down from the middle. Something angry is muttering to itself inside, and its apparently waiting for you. 

## Boss Fight - Venom Daoist

![Wukong UpperHollow 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Wukong_UpperHollow_36.jpg)

To commence the fight against the Venom Daoist, you'll need to bat the Odd Cocoon around like a pinata for awhile, until about half of its health bar is gone. Once your attack gets bounced away, the Venom Daoist will emerge, sporting two swords and eight arms to tear you apart. 

In reality, the Venom Daoist isn't the toughest opponent you've faced, but the low lighting will make it a little hard to see his attacks in his tangle of arms. Once you learn his positioning for his various attacks, you'll find plenty of opportunities to get in some of your own. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f5/Wukong_UpperHollow_37.jpg)

The Venom Daoist usually starts with his most basic attack, holding both swords to his side, and then springing forward with a dual slash on your right. He'll quickly follow up by rolling over to stab at the ground, and then after a moment leap into the air to slam down on top of you. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3e/Wukong_UpperHollow_38.jpg)

With a quick dodge to the side and behind him, you can avoid his first two attacks, and then sidestep his leap and begin your counterattack -- as it takes him several moments to rise up a second time. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/36/Wukong_UpperHollow_39.jpg)

If you see him hold his sword to the side but one sword high up behind his back, it means he's going to charge at you at a very fast speed. Dodge to the side, but then be ready for a second dash to come soon after requiring you to dodge once more. Try dodging alongside his second dash or lure him into a corner, and you'll find time to hit him while he resets himself. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f7/Wukong_UpperHollow_40.jpg)

When up close, he'll usually either perform an overhand slash followed by a leaping attack, or he'll pull back his swords to your left for two quick slashes followed by a dash attack. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/21/Wukong_UpperHollow_42.jpg)

Be ready for him to leap back with two more slashes after the dash, and wait until he returns to counter -- or simply Rock Solid his dash attack to stagger him back. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0d/Wukong_UpperHollow_41.jpg)

Attack his back when you can either by Immobilizing him or using Spirit Attacks for large area of effect hits, and you'll actually be able to start tearing apart his extra limbs, dealing massive damage in the process. 

When he starts to complain about this, be ready for more quick dashes as a retaliation strike. Still, he's not too great at adapting, since his attack with two jump slams will still cause him to expose his back when his swords are buried in the ground. 

![Wukong UpperHollow XX.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/af/Wukong_UpperHollow_XX.jpg)

When he starts getting low on health, expect him to get more desperate, throwing more sword slices into his combos. If you see him roll over himself at a distance, he'll slide at you foot first, but then vanish for a moment to appear straightened up before lashing out at you with a leap. Don't bother avoiding the slide, and just prepare to deflect his leap when he reappears. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2d/Wukong_UpperHollow_43.jpg)

After taking out 2-4 of his extra limbs, he'll likely run out of health, and will beat a hasty retreat. This isn't the last you'll see of him, and in fact he's essential to unlocking a secret area, so we'll look for him again later. At the very least, you'll earn experience and will both for beating him and his cocoon! 

With everything cleared on the top floor of the Webbed Hollow, it's time to make your way down. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 44.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/36/Wukong_UpperHollow_44.jpg)

Head back to the Pool of Shattered Jade Shrine, and look back to the path where the Scorpion Prince was to spot a large wooden scaffold bridge. Be sure to check around the left side first for a green Wisp, then cross the two-tiered bridge to drop down a level. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 45.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/16/Wukong_UpperHollow_45.jpg)

Look out for an archer on the lower floor here, and get rid of him before crossing the bridge to find a ledge with another green Wisp. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 46.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fe/Wukong_UpperHollow_46.jpg)

The series of platforms below will connect with the other platforms you saw earlier, and both lead down to a connecting platform to reach the Shrine below. Just be warned that a Beetle Captain guards the Shrine along with an archer, and you may want to stun the captain or use Cloud Step so you can quickly eliminate the archer first. 

Once you've activated the Verdure Bridge Shrine, it will be time to explore the even larger **Middle Hollow** portion of the Webbed Hollow Region.
