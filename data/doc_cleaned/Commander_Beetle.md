## Where to Find the Commander Beetle

The Commander Beetle is an optional boss -- though hard to miss as you explore the Temple of Yellow Flowers. From the Forest of Ferocity Shrine, you need only make your way along the main path and up the stairs to find a large courtyard where the boss trains a group of several Sword Daoists. 

## Commander Beetle Boss Fight and Guide

The Commander Beetle would be a fairly straightforward miniboss fight, if not for the six Sword Daoists he's currently training in the large courtyard where you'll find him just past the Forest of Ferocity. Unfortunately, these enemies will respawn until you defeat the Commander, so you won't be able to get him alone so easily.

Knowing that the Daoists don't have a whole lot of heath, there are two things you have on your side: large area-of-effect Spirit Attacks, and your Pluck of Many Spell. The Pluck of Many is a great bet for disorienting the group as you attack, though results can vary, and you'll likely have to jump in an finish off a few Daoists yourself. One is even likely to drop the **Fruit of Dao Soak** for your Gourd! 

This can get tricky, as the Commander Beetle won't just wait around patiently while you defeat his students. He can employ huge strikes that cleave the very ground in a line where he strikes, and if you aren't paying attention, you can usually get hit by the tremors before you know what's going on. 

Try to keep in view as much as possible while defeating the Daoists so you can prepare to dodge away from his moves.

Once it's down to a 1v1 fight, you'll find things a bit more approachable, though you should still be on guard. For all his talk of wanting to die, he's a very competent swordfighter, and uses his blades in a few distinct ways.

He can quickly charge at you in a lunging backhanded slice attack, which will result in a whirlwind of blade strikes all around him after a moment you'll also need to dodge.

As mentioned previously, the Commander Beetle can also perform of series of sword slams with his bigger left sword. The small line that extends from his strike won't look like much for a moment, until a large fissure erupts from the path of his weapon which he can do several times in a row.

Even when not slamming the ground, his bigger sword can also cut through the air to send a slicing wave of force at you from a distance, which comes out much faster than his slams, and can be done multiple times.

However, if he decides to hold his left weapon up by his face in a reverse grip fashion, it will become his shield, and he'll be able to soak any blows you try and land on him (even when Immobilized). Hit him too many times, and he'll launch into a swift two-hit counterattack. Luckily, you can counter his counter with a well-timed Rock Solid to throw him off.

Along with a variety of lunging attacks and dual-wield slashes, he also has a few unorthodox moves. If he tries to headbutt you by leaping on his side, resist the impulses to kick him when he's down. He'll recover from falling to the ground by doing a breakdancing kick spin while slashing with both swords to lift off the ground and damage you if you get close.

He can also adopt a ready stance and expel projectiles all around him. They'll fly about like angry gnats and threaten to deal several hits, but these are the kind of projectiles you can easily deflect with your staff spin.

Aside from this, he doesn't have too much else to worry about. As long as you can get rid of his students quickly, and react quickly whenever he swings the bigger sword, you can anticipate and retaliate against most of his moves. When he falls, he'll drop a Knot of Voidness, and you can claim his Commander Beetle Spirit.
