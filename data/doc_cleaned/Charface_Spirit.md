## Charface Location

You will come across Charface naturally as you make your way up the mountain. He can be found lurking inside a cave near the Heart of Ember Keeper's Shrine. To get there, head forward after defeating the Father of Stones Spirit and run through the gate on the right. The cave is at the bottom of the path.

## Charface Fight

Charface fights like all other enemies of his type. His weapon of choice is a large, fiery scimitar. Keep an eye on the massive knife, dodging its swings and going in for your own swipes once the combo is finished. Be careful once you've defeated him, as Charface swings two more times after he's killed.

  * **Magma Forged**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases charging speed. 

Charface's Spirit allows you to take his form and plunge his large, fiery scimitar into the ground, causing lava to explode out and burn any nearby foes. Charface is a strong enemy, and so is his Spirit. Not only can you deal massive damage to the enemies around you, but having Charface equipped also speeds up your charging speed, allowing you to charge Heavy Attacks faster.
