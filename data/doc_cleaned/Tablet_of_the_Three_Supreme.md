# Tablet of the Three Supreme

The Tablet of the Three Supreme is one of the many Curios items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. 

With the Tablet of the Three Supreme equipped your critical hit chance when your health is low is considerably increased. 

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Tablet of the Three Supreme Location

The Tablet of the Three Supreme Curios item is located within The Webbed Hollow, specifically at the Temple of Yellow Flowers - Forest of Ferocity location. At this Shrine spot, you will fight Commander Beetle and upon defeating him, he will drop the Tablet of the Three Supreme.
