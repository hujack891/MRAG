This Chapter 2 Secret can only be accessed by meeting the Yellow-Robed Square in Fright Cliff (aka the Drunken Boar), and helping him in his search for the "Realm of Gold" which requires a few steps (and for you to best him in combat). 

## How to Access the Kingdom of Sahali

![Wukong Fright 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7e/Wukong_Fright_39.jpg)

In order to unlock this secret area, you need to find the Drunk Boar (the Yellow-Robed Squire) who can be found in the Rockrest Flat part of the Fright Cliff region in Chapter 2. Head straight to the back of the area from the shrine to find a small breakable wooden fence protected by a Spearbone enemy. 

![Wukong Fright 59.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8c/Wukong_Fright_59.jpg)

In this large open field, you’ll find a friendly boar-like Guai resting on a rock. He’s apparently extremely inebriated, and needs you to help him find something to sober him up. He’ll mention “Windrest” if you talk to him again, providing a clue to where you can find such an ingredient. 

There are two ways to get the item required: 

![Wukong Fright 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Wukong_Fright_34.jpg)

  * If you complete the Man-in-Stone’s questline, you’ll find that the Man-in-Stone sells a **Sobering Stone** if you don’t want to explore.

![Wukong Yellow 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/13/Wukong_Yellow_10.jpg)

  * To locate the stone itself, you’ll need to head through the Yellow Wind Formation to the Windrest Hamlet, which is across the Windrest Bridge up the road past the Crouching Tiger Temple. Once you enter the hamlet, take a left to find a large building guarded by a Rat Soldier and Rat Imperial Guard. On the left side when looking at the large building, defeat a Blazebone monster, and then look to the right for a small alcove, where you can spot a glowing pot. Break the pot, and you’ll find the **Sobering Stone**.

![Wukong Yellow 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/55/Wukong_Yellow_33.jpg)

When you return it to the Drunken Boar, he’ll thank you, and declare that he’s now off in search of a meaty meal. He doesn’t actually want you to get some for him, and will set off himself to the Crouching Tiger Temple. 

![Wukong Yellow 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4f/Wukong_Yellow_34.jpg)

At the temple entrance, start to head up the stairs, and then turn right before the top — opposite where the Meditation Spot is. You’ll find the Boar resting against a far wall under one of the giant tiger sculptures.He’ll complain of the poor meat quality, and instead ask that you bring him a **Jade Lotus**. If you don’t already have plenty gathered, you’ll find Jade Lotus to harvest in most ponds and bodies of water, like the one right at the start of the chapter. 

![Wukong Yellow 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Wukong_Yellow_35.jpg)

When you give the Boar the Jade Lotus, he’ll relay some interesting information about a “Realm of Gold” that he’s seeking. Apparently he spoke to one of the rats, who said “our senior brother gave me a piece of gold. I’ll need it here when the time’s right.” He’ll then proclaim that the time is right, and will leave the temple. 

![Wukong Sandgate 71.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/94/Wukong_Sandgate_71.jpg)

This “senior brother” is the First Prince of Flowing Sand — aka the giant rat Yaoguai Chief that you can fight in the Valley of Despair on the road from Sandgate Village to the Crouching Tiger Temple. If you didn’t kill the rat king, he’ll summon the prince to fight you. Otherwise, you can use the Pungent Flesh Chunk to summon and defeat him yourself. He’ll drop the Arhat Gold Piece when defeated, which is the gold the Boar needs. 

![Wukong Sahali 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ae/Wukong_Sahali_1.jpg)

The Boar will actually return to near where you first met him at the Rockrest Flat area of the Fright Cliff. However, instead of sitting on a rock, he’ll now be standing over by the stairs leading to a large door you can’t access yet. 

Unfortunately, he’s not too pleased that you’re in possession of the gold, and will challenge you to a duel. Upon defeat, he’ll relent and offer to let you join him in exploring the Realm of Gold together, before vanishing off behind the giant gate up the stairs. 

![Wukong Sahali 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Wukong_Sahali_10.jpg)

Once you follow him through the large gate with the small crawlspace, you’ll find yourself overlooking an ancient and forgotten kingdom, and suddenly be transported into the past and into the Kingdom of Sahali 

## Sandgate Pass

![Wukong SahalI 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8c/Wukong_SahalI_11.jpg)

Arriving in this realm of the past, you’ll find yourself in a large canyon. Head up to find a Shrine on the left, and be sure to check the shop in this secret realm, as it offers wares not sold in the rest of the Yellow Wind Ridge: 

Kingdom of Sahali Shrine Shop   
Fortifying Medicament (x3) - 360 Will |   
Cold Iron Leaves (x2) - 900 Will | Refined Iron Sand (x1) - 1200 Will   
Licorice (x3) - 120 Will |   
  
![Wukong Sahali 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c0/Wukong_Sahali_12.jpg)

As you round the corner, you’ll be told to halt by the defender of a large gate: A slightly familiar looking Tiger Guai who calls himself the Vanguard of the Yellow Wind King. If he looks familiar to another Vanguard you’ve faced, that’s because he’s actually the other Vanguard’s father! He’ll ask that you turn around and head home, which seems like such a waste with all you’ve gone through just to get here. 

## Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - "Tiger Vanguard" (Kingdom of Sahali)

While this Tiger Vanguard is indeed related to the one you’ve faced at the Crouching Tiger Temple, he doesn’t fight in quite the exact same style, despite also having a sword. Understanding the differences and similarities in their style can help you succeed in this fight, but it will take a little practice. 

![Wukong Sahali 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/95/Wukong_Sahali_13.jpg)

This Tiger happens to be a big fan of lunging attacks, and will almost always start the fight by leaping at you low to the ground, clawing at you with his free hand as he comes to a stop. He’ll follow this with a slash from his sword rather quickly, and let the momentum carry him along the ground in a spin to perform a quick secondary overhead slash from his low position. 

It will take him a moment to get to his feet afterward, but you’ll want to react fast and retaliate, and possibly Immobilize him, or there’s a good chance he’ll leap away and retreat before his next attack. 

![Wukong Sahali 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f2/Wukong_Sahali_20.jpg)

Other times, his lunging attack will be just one big leaping sword slice while low to the ground, which is easier to dodge as it has no follow up most of the time, though he will turn to this move instead of finishing some of his combo attacks to throw you off your guard. 

Every so often, he’ll decline the lunge, and simply swing his sword up to send a projectile slash your way. The good news is it's rare and just a single slash, moving slow enough that it can be dodged reliably well. 

![Wukong Sahali 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f6/Wukong_Sahali_14.jpg)

Note that you can use the Rock Solid deflection spell to surprise him (since it's his own spell that he passed down to the son you gained it from) but he can also use the spell as well. It’s not as obvious as when the other boss used it, as his fur will darken but he won’t turn completely to stone. 

![Wukong Sahali 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/12/Wukong_Sahali_19.jpg)

If you ever see him freeze up (usually in a ready stance) hold off on attacking and instead charge up for a heavy attack when he starts to move again. If you attack too early, he’ll counter your deflected attack by whirling on you with a claw swipe, followed by a leaping downward slash with a huge arc and a delay before he lands. 

![Wukong Sahali 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/23/Wukong_Sahali_15.jpg)

He can also employ this huge sweeping arc attack by other means, most notably when he tries to plunge his sword in the ground near you, he’ll rip it out while performing a huge spin attack. 

![Wukong Sahali 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/41/Wukong_Sahali_16.jpg)

Another attack he employs frequently begins when he pivots his body by spinning into an over the shoulder claw swipe, which he’ll quickly follow through by swiping back upwards, and then kick outward after a short delay. You can parry the first below with Rock Solid when you see him spin to completely throw him off of the whole combo. 

![Wukong Sahali 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bf/Wukong_Sahali_18.jpg)

One powerful (yet deflectable) attack he can also employ has a long wind up as he’ll drag his sword slowly along the ground, building up friction and sparks as he drags it to you before ripping the blade up. Rock Solid can stop the attack but won’t always stagger him, but it’s easier to see coming than other moves. 

![Wukong Sahali 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Wukong_Sahali_17.jpg)

As for his more unique attacks, watch for the Tiger Vanguard to raise his hands up, as he’ll then let loose an incredibly powerful roar that will damage you, and cause rock explosions all around him. This one can be very tough to dodge considering the range and how quickly he goes into the roar, but you can stop him short by Immobilizing him and then dealing enough damage to stagger him and prevent the roar altogether. 

Since he’s not as powerful or varied as the Vanguard of the Crouching Tiger Temple, nor is he as unrelentingly powerful as the Mad Tiger below the well, he shouldn’t give you as much problems as his sons. Remember to try switching up your stances — especially to the Thrust Stance — if you want to play it safe with longer range heavy strikes out of his reach. 

![Wukong Sahali 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e6/Wukong_Sahali_21.jpg)

Upon defeat, you’ll gain the **Tiger Tally** curio, and he’ll realize your prowess and invite you to meet his king. 

Tiger Vanguard (Kingdom of Sahali)

## Sandgate Bound

![Wukong Sahali 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1e/Wukong_Sahali_22.jpg)

Past the Tiger Vanguard, you’ll find a pretty staggeringly big open desert landscape for a Secret Area. There’s not as much to do as it may look like, but there are a few secrets worth picking up before talking to the big guy on the cliff. 

![Wukong Sahali 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/ca/Wukong_Sahali_23.jpg)

There are more than a few plants to gather that are scattered around the upper plains here, including Licorice. If you move straight ahead, you can find the Sandgate Bound Shrine by some rocks before the large cliff. 

![Wukong Sahali 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/05/Wukong_Sahali_24.jpg)

If you search the left side when facing the central cliff by the Shrine, you can explore some ruins to find a chest by some wooden columns that contains a **Gold Ridge Beast** to sell, and **Knot of Voidness** material that can be used for advanced Spirit Cultivation. 

![Wukong Sahali 45.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8a/Wukong_Sahali_45.jpg)

Further down this left side, avoid falling down the sandy slopes until you reach a rocky area by the very far edge of the lip of this ridgeline. Look carefully, and you can spot the final **Meditation Point** for Chapter 2, granting you a free Spark Skill Point. 

The Rock, Sandgate Bound Mediation Spot

![Wukong Sahali 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a4/Wukong_Sahali_25.jpg)

Next, search the far right side of this sandy area above the slope, until you come to the farthest edge by the rocks. Here you’ll find another wooden chest, and inside you can grab a **Mind Core** , 4 **Yaoguai Core** , and 523 **Will**. 

Now head up the middle cliff to find none other than the Yellow Wind Sage — only its a version of him from the past. Since your goal isn’t to fight this incarnation, you’ll actually be able to offer your help in defeating another Yaoguai King - a legendary and dangerous scarab who haunts the sands below. 

![Wukong Sahali 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a5/Wukong_Sahali_26.jpg)

The yellow-furred rat is at an impasse, as the scarab’s magic is preventing him from engaging the monster directly. This is where you come on. The Yellow Rat Sage will agree to pound the drums to force the scarab to the surface, allowing you to engage the behemoth directly and find whatever vessel is giving it its power. 

## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Fuban

![Wukong Sahali 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/43/Wukong_Sahali_27.jpg)

Once you make your way down either of the slopes into the large sandy dunes where the giant Scarab Yaoguai called Fuban has emerged, you’ll be in for a battle against a juggernaut of a scarab beetle. 

Don’t let its imposing size scare you too much - this battle isn’t as hard as many others in Chapter 2 despite being a secret boss, as long as you know when and where to attack. 

Fuban will likely begin by burrowing into the ground and vanishing, and the Yellow Wind Sage will call out to watch for the sands rumbling to tell where Fuban is approaching from. 

![Wukong Sahali 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/65/Wukong_Sahali_28.jpg)

He’ll then leap high into the air and try to crash down on you, which can be a bit confusing due to the camera angle, but you’ll need to dodge just before he crashes down (or use your Rock Solid, though it won’t stagger this boss). 

![Wukong Sahali 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c0/Wukong_Sahali_29.jpg)

After he lands, you’ll be instructed to strike at its claws, so move yourself to the side and lock onto one of the front claws of the beast. Fuban won’t move around too much during this period, but may shake its head around requiring you to dodge a few slams. 

![Wukong Sahali 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/15/Wukong_Sahali_30.jpg)

Fuban can also slowly pull one of its claws back to then sweep upward in front of his face, which can damage you if you aren’t paying attention. If you’re worried about getting hit, you can also play it safe and stick with the Thrust Stance to hit its claws with a long range heavy attack. 

![Wukong Sahali 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/ca/Wukong_Sahali_32.jpg)

Other attacks can include swipes with both hands that sweep side to side, so even if one hand swipes past, don’t get too confident in thinking the danger has passed in case another claw on the other side sweeps your way. 

![Wukong Sahali 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/17/Wukong_Sahali_31.jpg)

Fuban can also rear back on its hind legs before slamming down to create a large shockwave, and will require a well-timed dodge, or you can turn into stone form to soak the blow. 

![Wukong Sahali 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9a/Wukong_Sahali_33.jpg)

Be wary if you see Fuban start to pivot and turn away from you. It will duck down and show you the giant vessel attached to its carapace — a huge stone head — and then promptly ram it into you. This is a tough attack to dodge neatly if you aren’t expecting it, and will deal a ton of damage if it lands. 

![Wukong Sahali 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e6/Wukong_Sahali_34.jpg)

Once you’ve taken off around a third of its health, Fuban will back up and burrow back into the ground. Once again, it will start to swim through the sand at you, which your lock on will thankfully stick to. 

![Wukong Sahali 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/63/Wukong_Sahali_35.jpg)

This time, Fuban will swim right under you, and pierce upward with its horn to try and skewer you. The good news is that by using your Pillar Stance, you can raise up away from the explosion, and will only lose a chunk of stamina as the sand erupts, while avoiding damage. 

![Wukong Sahali 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/96/Wukong_Sahali_36.jpg)

However, this won’t end Fuban’s underground reign of terror, as he’ll keep moving his horn up and down from below the sands to attack twice as his horn moves up and down, so keep dodging to stay out of the way. 

![Wukong Sahali 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/92/Wukong_Sahali_37.jpg)

Once Fuban starts another charge, he’ll repeat doing several leap attacks in a row that you’ll need to keep avoiding. Luckily, the Yellow Wind Sage will put an end to this by banging the drums more to stun Fuban entirely. 

![Wukong Sahali 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f2/Wukong_Sahali_38.jpg)

At this point, the battle will be paused and Fuban stunned, allowing you to climb up via its head to reach the large statue on its back. Jump onto the statue head, and look for a glowing eye to examine. You’ll then retrieve the Vessel that gives Fuban much of its power to fend off the yellow rat, who can now join you for the rest of the battle! 

![Wukong Sahali 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/92/Wukong_Sahali_39.jpg)

In this second phase, things will get even easier thanks to the Yellow Wind Sage on your side. You’ll be able to let him to the main talking. He can deal incredible damage with his wind attacks, which you can supplement by continuing the assault on his claws.You’ll still need to be mindful of his charge attacks and claw swipes, but you’re given more room to hang back and heal while the rat takes the brunt of his aggression. 

![Wukong Sahali 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1e/Wukong_Sahali_40.jpg)

By dealing enough damage, the Yellow Wind Sage can also knock Fuban to the ground. Be wary when approaching at first, if you see Fuban start to thrash left and right, it’s better to hang back, and wait until the rat can follow up with another powerful attack to stun Fuban until he lies on his side. 

![Wukong Sahali 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5b/Wukong_Sahali_41.jpg)

That’s your cue to rush in and hit Fuban’s exposed area with your biggest hits, using charged strikes, Spirit Attacks, and Transformation Spells to unload on the beetle before he can rise up. 

When following this strategy, you’ll quickly burn through the rest of Fuban’s health bar, and between you and the Yellow Wind Sage, the beetle will stand little chance. He can still repeatedly slam his head in the ground to create shockwaves, and finally pull up with a massive explosion. Again, the Pillar Stance can be useful for dodging these blasts, so long as you have a bit of distance away from him too. 

![Wukong Sahali 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5b/Wukong_Sahali_43.jpg)

When he’s finally out of health, the battle will be won, and the Yellow Wind Sage will valiantly land the final blow. It’s a shame we’ll have to beat him up in the future. For your part in the battle, you’ll earn a Sky-Piercing Horn weapon material, and a new Vessel: The Wind Tamer! 

Fuban

![Wukong Sahali 44.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a3/Wukong_Sahali_44.jpg)

Just as the Vessel from Chapter 1 proved a huge advantage against the Black Bear King, so too will the Wind Tamer be instrumental in negating the sandstorm attacks of the Yellow Wind Sage boss at the end of Chapter 2. Even outside of that fight, you can utilize it to grant additional damage negation, making it a great addition to your gear.
