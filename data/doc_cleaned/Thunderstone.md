# Thunderstone

The Thunderstone is one of the many Curios items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. 

With the Thunderstone equipped your Shock resistance is moderately increased. 

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Thunderstone Location

The Thunderstone can be found in the largest Pagoda at New Thunderclap Temple in The New West. From the Temple Entrance, head all the way up the first flight of stairs until you see a building on your right. The Curios is sat behind a statue in a box.
