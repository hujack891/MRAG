## Non-Able Location

You can find Non-Able in a small, snowy clearing in the Brook of Bliss just below the small Pagoda. To get there, head to the Brook of Bliss Keeper's Shrine and take the stairs on the right. Head up the hill to the left until you reach the clearing outside the Pagoda. Turn left to find Non-Able tied up in the center of the snowy plain.

## Non-Able Fight

Non-Able is tied up during the first half of the fight and is unable to use his hands. For that portion of the fight, you will mainly contend with stomp and kick-based attacks. During the second half of the fight, however, Non-Able tears his ropes, freeing his hands and widening his move pool. 

The timing of Non-Able's punches follows the same pattern as his kicks. Watch closely and wait for him to wind up before quickly dodging out of the way before his hit lands.

  * **Seasoned Punch**
  * Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Attack, Critical Hit Chance, and Critical Damage, but massively reduces Maximum Mana. 

Non-Able's Spirit Power is a very situational one. It allows you to take the form of Non-Able and deliver a flurry of blows on your foe. The attack itself is fine, but the equipped effect is quite harsh and will render Non-Able more or less unusable, depending on your playstyle. Non-Able's equipped effect raises your Attack, Critical Hit Chance, and Critical Damage but massively reduces your Maximum Mana. And when they say massively, they mean it. If you use magic a lot, Non-Able might not be a good Spirit for you.
