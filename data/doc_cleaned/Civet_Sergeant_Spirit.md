## Civet Sergeant Location

The Civet Sergeant is lurking in the depths of the Crouching Tiger Temple. After defeating both the Tiger Vanguard and Stone Vanguard bosses, head back to the temple with your Keenness of Tiger and Keenness of Stone items and place them in the receptacle near the sculpture at the back of the boss arena.

This will open a secret door in the pool of blood that leads you to the Civet Sergeant in the Crouching Tiger Temple Cellar. 

## Civet Sergeant Fight

The Civet Sergeant fight is no walk in the park. There are around five Civet Sergeants to deal with, all of which are hurling knives, flipping around you, and hounding you at once. Immobilize and A Pluck of Many spells will make this fight much easier and level the playing field a little.

  * **Heart Ripper**
  * Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Attack.

The Civet Sergeant's Spirit allows you to embody him long enough to hurl two blades straight into your foe's chest. This is a pretty decent attack that's further bolstered by the Civet Sergeant's equipped effect that increases your attack power. Having more attack power is always helpful in Black Myth: Wukong, making the Civet Sergeant a worthwhile Spirit to pour resources into upgrading.
