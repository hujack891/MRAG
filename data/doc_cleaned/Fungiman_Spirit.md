## Fungiman Location

Fungiman is hidden in one of the cells in the Pagoda Realm. As you're exploring the Pagoda, pluck all the mushrooms you find. One mushroom in a corner by some bars is the Fungiman, who will crawl out of the ground when you try to pick him up.

## Fungiman Fight

Fungiman is armed with a giant staff and plenty of poisonous spores to surround you with. In addition to blunt attacks with the staff, make sure not to step on any of the poison gas on the floor. Making contact with the gas will start to poison you and eat away at your health. When casting Immobilize, wait until the ground is clear of poison so you can really lay it on him without worrying about getting poisoned at the same time.

  * **Whirl**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases the recovery speed of Might. 

The Fungiman's Spirit Power allows you to embody the creature and swing your staff around in a circle, creating a vortex of pain that will damage anything that makes contact with it. The attack itself is pretty strong, and the equipped effect is also handy, increasing the recovery speed of your Might. **Might is the power you need to hold your Transformations in Black Myth: Wukong.**
