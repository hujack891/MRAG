# Stranded Loong's Whisker

The Stranded Loong's Whisker is one of the Epic Soaks for your Gourds in Black Myth: Wukong. The Soak's ability is powerful, and definitely one of the stronger ones in the game. 

With the Soak equipped, using the gourd moderately extends the duration of the next Immobilize Spell for a short duration. 

Soaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Iron Pellet Location

The Stranded Loong's Whisker can be obtained at the Mirrormere Shrine in The New West. Walk onto the lake, but stick to the right side. Continue all the way to the back right corner of the lake to find the Soak sitting in a container.

Soaks are far more plentiful than the drinks for your gourds. They are scattered throughout the game, across each chapter. For even more guides on these areas, check out our full Black Myth: Wukong walkthrough. You can also keep track of the Awaken Wine Worm locations and Luoija Fragrant Vine locations, which are key to upgrading your healing potential and Gourd.
