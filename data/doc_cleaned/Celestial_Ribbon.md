# Celestial Ribbon

Celestial Ribbon is one of the rarest materials in Black Myth: Wukong. It is used for some of the highest upgrades in the game to turn gear and weapons into Mythical gear or craft new Mythical Gear. 

Celestial Ribbon can be found from Chapter 5 - The Flaming Mountains and onwards consistently and in the following locations: 

  * Defeat Hundred-Eye Daoist Master in Chapter 4 - The Webbed Hollow
  * Occassionally Found in Chests
  * Dropped from bosses in F laming Mountains
  * Bought from the Shrine Store in Mount Huaguo 
  * Defeat bosses in Chapter 6 - Mount Huaguo 

Be sure to hold onto them as you play to upgrade and craft new items.
