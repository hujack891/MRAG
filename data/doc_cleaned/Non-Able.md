## Where to Find Non-Able

Non-Able is an optional boss, and sits alone in a large snowy field in the Valley of Ecstasy. You'll find him by heading down the hill from the main road in the Forest of Felicity and into the Brook of Bliss, and then cross the bridge and head up the hill past the Shrine.

Just past the crowd of Frozen Corpses, you'll find the most important thing in this region: A lone man bound and kneeling in front of a large stone pagoda on the hill above. 

### Non-Able Miniboss Fight and Guide

Don't mistake his subdued appearance for weakness, Non-Able is probably one of the toughest Yaoguai Chief bosses you'll face in Chapter 3. Unlike other enemies, he won't use any magic or ranged tricks on you, and trades it all in for overwhelming power and a mastery of martial arts that makes him an extremely challenging foe -- and that's before the restraints come off. 

If you haven't made use of them in other fights, now is definitely the time to take advantage of all the medicinal pills and consumable buffs you can craft and use. Items like the Tiger Subduing Pellets to raise your attack and others that can raise your stamina or focus can all help out greatly, and you'll want every advantage on your side.

Though he begins with his hands tied, Non-Able is an expert fighter who can utilize some deadly kicks and deal immense damage and can strike with little warning. Any time you see him angle his head down to your right, be ready for a roundhouse kick to spring out fast. 

![Wukong Brook 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/21/Wukong_Brook_16.jpg)

He'll often follow this very fast kick with a jump kick, but delay it in the air before striking to lure you into dodging early, and then follow up once he lands with a spin on the ground for extra damage at close range.

If he instead crouches down slightly but keeps his head angled forward, he can lash out with another very quick side kick, followed by anywhere from 1-3 extra spinning roundhouse kicks as he uses their momentum to keep up with your evasions. 

He can also easily chain this into a high leap as he somersaults into a slam onto the ground requiring another fast dodge. 

Any of these attacks can be chained together with rolling kicks that come in a few different ways when he's low to the ground, so you'll need to be very aware of his movements and when the best time is to press the attack, and when to back off and conserve stamina. 

![Wukong Brook 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3e/Wukong_Brook_18.jpg)

With many of his attacks having severely short range, the Thrust Stance can be incredibly useful to retreat into a heavy attack once you have a focus point. The Pillar Stance can also be useful to gain height over many of his low kicks, but you'll need to make sure you have a lot of spare stamina to soak up his hits. 

![Wukong Brook 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8d/Wukong_Brook_20.jpg)

Since things are rarely as easy as they seem, eliminating his health bar will trigger phase two, whereupon he'll break his restraints and not only fight you with his fists, but supercharge his limbs to deal an insane amount of damage! 

![Wukong Brook 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/db/Wukong_Brook_19.jpg)

Non-Able will always start his second phase with an immediate charge to grab you. This can't be blocked, and the timing can be hard to dodge to the side, so you're better off dodging backward or using Cloud Step when he reaches out with his right hand. Get caught, and you'll take a ton of damage. Be warned if you try to Immobilize him mid-grab, he can often pop out of it and continue the grab animation unless you reposition yourself somewhere safe.

If you can believe it, this boss still has more kick attacks to show off, and can now unleash a quick three-hit combo after starting to crouch down and angle his head to your left. Watch out for his incredibly fast roundhouse kicks to fly out one after the other, and only after the third will he pause to stretch out his leg and give you room to retaliate. 

![Wukong Brook 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fa/Wukong_Brook_22.jpg)

He's even faster at chaining his attacks together, and even after the three-kick combo he can slam the ground with his fist to charge it up, then come at you with a spin, feinting a kick to trick you into dodging before unleashing a blast with his gold glowing fist. 

![Wukong Brook 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/76/Wukong_Brook_33.jpg)

When using his fists, he'll often employ a three hit combo starting with an overhand swing with his right fist, and then a quick straight punch with his left, before expelling energy by opening his left palm for one last strike. 

Any time any of his limbs glow, you'll need to be extremely careful, as getting hit can take off a huge chunk of your life (making consumables that raise your max health even more important!) 

![Wukong Brook 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f4/Wukong_Brook_26.jpg)

This limbs will often glow after he expels energy around him in a damaging wave. Some will start a longer combo move, while others can be a single strike, like leaping into the air to smash down with two glowing fists. 

![Wukong Brook 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8f/Wukong_Brook_27.jpg)

Another can be done at range, so even if you think you're at a safe distance, be ready to dodge if he adopts a stance and then dashes up for a glowing elbow strike attack. 

![Wukong Brook 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/75/Wukong_Brook_28.jpg)

By far his most dangerous move will come when he adopts a martial arts stance, holding a raised fist behind his head while dropping the other arm. 

![Wukong Brook 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ee/Wukong_Brook_24.jpg)

After expelling energy around him (also dealing a lot of damage) to dissuade any attacks you might be trying to land, he'll move forward with a quick 1-2 punch with alternating palm strikes, the second one dealing a massive amount of damage and projecting his strike with extended range. The rapidity of these attacks often ensures that if you try to dodge the first hit, you'll get slammed by the second, and even using Rock Solid will just send you toppling backward. In these instances, using Cloud Step or Immobilize can be beneficial to getting away from this move, but be ready for him to resume the attack after Immobilize ends. 

![Wukong Brook 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c6/Wukong_Brook_29.jpg)

However, he can vary up his moves to keep you guessing. Sometimes after the aforementioned stance, he can also abandon his palm blast for a quick sliding spin kick, so keep an eye on his movements and don't get comfortable in predicting his movements. 

![Wukong Brook 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/42/Wukong_Brook_23.jpg)

That's not the only martial arts stance he can adopt, either. If you see him flex both arms vertically below his face, he'll do a variation on the three-hit palm strike. Only in these cases, he'll often follow up his third attack with a delayed final hit, spinning his body to backhand you with his glowing right hand that can decimate your health bar. 

![Wukong Brook 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a5/Wukong_Brook_25.jpg)

Having stamina in reserve is crucial for this phase, as Non-Able routinely flows into very long combo attacks that are hard to keep pace with. One attack will have him start with a shoulder check, and then expel energy from his raised palm. He'll quickly flow into a sweeping punch and two spinning kicks all in a row, which again is where moves like Cloud Step or Immobilize can help grant you some breathing room. 

Expect this fight to take you awhile to learn. For any chance of winning, you'll need to learn his first phase enough to the point you can power him down quickly before he can do much damage in return, and save the majority of your healing for phase two. 

![Wukong Brook 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/58/Wukong_Brook_31.jpg)

Be sure to experiment using your spells to their fullest. Rock Solid can sometimes knock him back, but often will send you skidding back instead, making Cloud Step a great alternative. We also found Red Tides to be a great transformation spell to keep up with dodging his rapid attacks, though you can also soak the blows with Azure Dust, but you won't be able to land many hits. 

![Wukong Brook 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/11/Wukong_Brook_30.jpg)

You can even try using Pluck of Many to let your summons hit him from behind while you distract his largely single-target attacks. 

Once you have finally defeated Non-Able, you'll be able to obtain the Non-Able Spirit, which has a pretty intense effect for raising your stats while lowering your mana.
