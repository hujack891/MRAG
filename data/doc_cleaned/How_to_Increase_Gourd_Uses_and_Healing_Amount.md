Early on, you may try and best certain powerful optional bosses to see glowing spirits they leave behind. Trying to interact with them will prompt the notification "Cannot absorb Spirits without guidance."

The good news is that you won't have long to wait to get said guidance, as you'll find a strange man with a giant gourd on his back just up the stairs from the Snake Trail Shrine in the Bamboo Grove. Speak to him, and he'll upgrade your Gourd to allow Spirit Absorption, which you can use go gain Will from green Wisps, and harness the Spirit Attacks of certain enemies and bosses that drop purple or blue Spirits when they die.

If you tried to absorb one before gaining the upgrade, simply head to your Shrine and select the Spirit Cultivation option, and you can retrieve any Spirits you left out in the world.

The good news is the Gourd can be upgraded from Chapter 1 but you’ll need to wait until you reach Bamboo Grove. When you reach this section, continue on until you reach the Marsh of the White Mist Keeper’s Shrine. Before you proceed, look opposite the shrine to find a tree, where a golden vine hangs down. This is Luojia Fragrant Vine, which is an essential item for upgrading the Gourd. 

After collecting the Luojia Fragrant Vine, the next step is to continue to the bridge. As you step onto it, a lone snake will be waiting for you and someone will begin to talk to you, asking for help. This is the Shen Monkey, and once you’ve dealt with the enemy, a cutscene will play.

Follow the Shen Monkey into the cave after this, and speak to him. You’ll now have the option appear to Upgrade Gourds, Upgrade Drinks, and Brew. Whenever you want to upgrade your Gourd or the drink you’re using, you’ll need to return to the Shen Monkey.

Now that you have access to the Upgrade Gourds menu, you’ll be able to increase the number of uses. To do this, you’ll need to collect Luojia Fragrant Vine. Using these will not upgrade all your Gourds; you’ll need to improve each one individually.

To increase the amount of heals the Gourd will grant you, you’ll want to choose the Upgrade Drinks menu. Here you can see all the Drinks you’ve collected, but you’ll need Awaken Wine Worm to increase the efficiency of Drinks.

## How to Brew

In addition to being able to upgrade the amount of Gourd uses and the efficiency of your healing, you can also add Soaks to your drink. This option is available under Brew (which also replenishes your drink). Adding Soaks to your drinks will give it an additional buff. The Gall Gem, for example, that you get from helping the Shen Monkey gives you Poison Resistance. 

Once you’ve met the Shen Monkey, the Brew option will become available at the Keeper’s Shrine, so you don’t need to travel back to him to play around with the Soaks. You just need to return each time you want to upgrade your Gourd uses or the healing amount! 

The Shen Monkey will update his wares the farther you get in your adventure, so be sure to return to him after starting a new Chapter to see if sells more goods!
