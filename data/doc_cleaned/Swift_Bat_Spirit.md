## Swift Bat Location

The Swift Bat is hidden in a secret cave in Yellow Wind Ridge. To find it, make your way to the First Prince of Flowing Sands boss arena. On the opposite side of the arena, you will find a wooden plank leading to another area. Pass over the plank and head down to find a small crack in the wall. Interact with the crack to squeeze through and end up in the den of the Swift Bat.

## Swift Bat Fight

The Swift Bat isn't a boss like the Earth Wolf or Wandering Wight, but is still a reasonably difficult fight in its own right. Swift Bats are extremely fast and can be difficult to reach when they're up in the sky. You can expect to be swooped by the Swift Bat, hit with a volley of projectiles, or swiped at with the beast's clawed hands.

  * **Wing Flapper**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Stamina recovery. 

The Swift Bat's Spirit Power allows you to take the bat's form long enough to spread your massive wings and flap them, hitting your foe with a wave of stones kicked up from the ground. The damage caused by the Swift Bat's attack is decent, but it's not the most powerful Spirit by any means. The equipped effect, however, is extremely helpful and increases the rate at which your Stamina charges. 

Stamina is required to complete combos, sprint, and jump in Black Myth: Wukong. It is quite an essential skill, so having something that boosts your Stamina recovery is very helpful.
