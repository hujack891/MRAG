## Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai Location

The Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai is a mushroom-based enemy that you can find in the Ashen Pass in the Flaming Mountains. The Guai is found in a small clearing to the right of the Ashen Pass III Keeper's Shrine. The clearing itself will have a few mushrooms growing in it, one of which is the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai. Pick them all to lure the Guai out of hiding.

## Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai Fight

The Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai fight is a bit of a tricky one thanks to the Guai's unique skill. The Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai can cover you in a thick layer of red spores that hinder your movement and poison you. These spores hang around for a long time and can severely impact your fighting. Other than its mushroom-inflicting skill, it fights with a staff and poison, similar to the other mushroom enemies you will have faced thus far in your journey. 

Once defeated, the Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai provides both its Spirit and the Earth Spirit Cap. The Earth Spirit Cap saps your health but greatly increases the effectiveness of your Gourd.

  * Equipped Effect: Moderately reduces the Mana cost of Mysticism Spells. 

The Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai's Spirit allows you to take his form and don his cap. Upon doing so, little red mushrooms will appear in the ground around you, bursting and dealing Poison Damage to nearby enemies. Channeling this Spirit also reduces the Mana cost for Mysticism Spells. Mysticism Spells include Immobilize and Ring of Fire. Immobilize is the best skill in the game, so if you use it a lot, The Nine-Capped Lingzhi Guai could be a great Spirit for you to channel.
