# Thunderflame Seal

The Thunderflame Seal is one of the many Curios items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. 

With the Thunderflame Seal equipped your maximum Mana is considerably increased. 

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Thunderflame Seal Location

The Thunderflame Seal can be found randomly from any Lightning Mage within The New West. The best place to farm them is in the Valley of Ecstasy in Brook of Bliss.
