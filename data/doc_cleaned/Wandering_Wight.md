# Wandering Wight

The Wandering Wight is an optional and very challenging Yaoguai Chief boss fight that you can encounter early in Chapter 1 of Black Myth Wukong. The Wight is much tougher than any other bosses you can fight this early in the game, and while it is still possible to defeat them early, it is highly recommended that you level up further before taking them on. 

  * Rewards: Wandering Wight Spirit, Cat’s Eye Beads, Stone Spirit, 691 Will, 1,049 Experience

## Where to Find the Wandering Wight

The Wandering Wight is hard to miss as despite it being an optional challenge encounter, he is located along the main path and essentially guards a tunnel entrance leading to Guanyin Temple and the main boss of the Forest of Wolves.

You can find him in the Forest of Wolves area by proceeding straight from the Outside the Forest Shrine, and past an axe-wielding Wolf Guai across a small bridge to a large clearing where the hulking giant patrols back and forth. Due to his staggering size, he’s hard to miss! 

## Wandering Wight Boss Fight and Guide

As mentioned before, the Wandering Wight is an extremely tough opponent to challenge as early as you encounter him in Chapter 1. It’s highly recommended you run past him on your first encounter and return to fight after gaining better gear and abilities. We recommend coming back to challenge him after getting through most of the Bamboo Forest region of Black Wind Mountain — especially due to the fact that one of the rewards from the Wandering Wight can’t be accessed until you gain an upgrade in the Bamboo Forest. 

If you do try to fight him early, we at least recommend making a quick detour left of the Wandering Wight to fight a much more manageable optional Yaoguai Chief — Guangzhi — as he drops a Transformation Spell that can be instrumental in surviving this fight. 

Do be warned however, that you should defeat this optional boss before you unlock the Chapter 1 Secret Area by ringing three large bells. Once you challenge the boss of the Ancient Guanyin Temple, the Wandering Wight will disappear, and you will no longer be able to challenge him and gain his rewards!

The Wandering Wight patrols a large clearing in the Forest of Wolves, and you can actually use this to your advantage by sneaking up behind him and charging up a heavy smash attack to start the fight, dealing big damage right out of the gate.

What makes the Wandering Wight such a tough opponent isn’t just the massive damage he can deal with a single attack, but the deceptive power and speed some of his attacks can have. Many times the Wight will default to attacking with two lengthy foot stomps, which can be easy to dodge once you get the timing down. 

![Wukong Wight 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/07/Wukong_Wight_3.jpg)

However, he’ll usually follow these stomps with a series of up to three spinning sweep attacks, twirling quickly in a large arc that will damage you unless you dodge at the right time. Since he may or may not follow up one spin with another, you’ll need to be very careful in figuring out when it’s okay to retaliate with an attack.

Even worse, some of his combos can add with him performing an extremely fast leaping stomp attack, which covers a good amount of distance and is hard to react to when the speed is much faster than his other stomps.

However, the nastiest attack in the Wandering Wight’s disposal is easily his earthquake causing slam attack. If you see him wave his hands before holding one up in the air, be ready to dodge or start running away fast, as he’ll slam his fist into the ground and cause an explosion around him. 

![Wukong Wight 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9f/Wukong_Wight_5.jpg)

Most times, he’ll keep his hand in the ground and begin to pulse two more explosions that increase in range, followed by one final blast that’s delayed to lure you in, so be sure to take a breather and heal during this part if needed. While it’s sometimes possible to use the Pillar Stance to rise above the quakes if you are able to unlock the tree, it doesn’t always work, and isn’t recommended.

Once you learn the tells for his earthquake attack, you can start to anticipate and even negate this attack if you’re clever. When you see him raising his hand up to prepare to slam down, cast Immobilize on him to stop him from completing the attack. Deal enough damage with a combo and heavy strike, and you’ll stagger him out of Immobilize and out of the entire attack! 

![Wukong Wight 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e1/Wukong_Wight_8.jpg)

If you see him stagger away from your hits, press the attack whenever possible, as following up with a charged heavy strike while he’s stumbling can even cause him to fall down on his back, giving you an extended period to dish out damage before he can rise up. 

![Wukong Wight 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/83/Wukong_Wight_7.jpg)

If you keep your distance and wait for the end of his growing earthquake explosions, don’t get too comfortable. The Wandering Wight will regularly end his series of explosions by rapidly moving his hands and charging up before blasting an energy wave directly at you. This will also deal massive damage, and you’ll need to begin strafing and time your dodge to the side to avoid its blast. 

If you find yourself low on health and in danger of being defeated, remember that you can use the Red Tides Transformation Spell to turn into the Wolf Guai, which will grant you a new health bar to use for a limited time. Make the most of it by unleashing quick combos and continuing to dodge his strikes and build up Might, and then perform a special spell with a full Might bar by dodging an attack and then using the heavy attack button to perform an explosive pogo jump to take off a huge piece of his health! 

Expect this boss to take some time to defeat, as you can easily fall to any number of his attacks while you learn the timing to his sweeping spin attacks, hand blast, and earthquake tremors. Keep a watch on your stamina to know when to pull back and recharge, and use lulls in combat to replenish health when out of range of his earthquake. 

When the Wandering Wight finally falls, you’ll get the Cat’s Eye Beads Curio to equip for a passive bonus, as well as a Stone Spirit material and 691 Will. 

## How to Absorb Spirit With Guidance

He will also leave behind the Wandering Wight Spirit — a purple glowing wisp — for you to absorb. if you tried to defeat this boss early, interacting with it will prompt the note: "Cannot Absorb Spirit Without Guidance".

Luckily, you don't have too far to go gain this upgrade. This can only be done once you’ve met the Ancient Master in the Bamboo Grove who will upgrade your Gourd. If you haven’t done this yet, don’t worry — the Spirit will appear in your Shrine menu when attempting to Cultivate Spirits after the gourd has been upgraded.
