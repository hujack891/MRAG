# Fiery Gourd

The Fiery Gourd is one of the Epic Gourds within Black Myth: Wukong. It has a high number of uses and is incredibly useful against ice-damage bosses and in The New West. 

With 7 uses, using the Gourd grants Chill immunity, ensuring you can't be slowed by ice damage. Additionally, when using it, your maximum stamina is increased for a short duration, adding a nice boon to your overall stats in the middle of a fight. Unfortunately, the Fiery Gourd can't be upgraded at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove in Black Wind Mountain. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Fiery Gourd Location

The Fiery Gourd in Black Myth: Wukong can be found in Mindfulness Cliff in the Valley of Ecstasy in The New West. From the Shrine, drop down into the area below and continue through the caves and cliffs.

Along the path, you will find a chest which holds the Fiery Gourd. Continue along the path to also find the Skandha of Thought, one of the Key Items you need to find a secret boss in the game's sixth chapter.
