# Temple of Yellow Flowers Walkthrough

The Temple of Yellow Flowers is the final main area of Black Myth: Wukong's Chapter 4, located high above the Webbed Hollow on. Below you'll find a guide for the final area of The Webbed Hollow, including how to track down the Violet Spider and defeat the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, as well as getting a rematch with the Venom Daoist to unlock a Secret Area, and finding the last Purple Talisman Altar.

When you untangle yourself from the webbing, you'll find yourself high above the Webbed Hollow, on a mountain path leading to a large temple filled with Daoist martial artists. 

## Mountain Trail

![Wukong YellowFlower 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ab/Wukong_YellowFlower_2.jpg)

Waiting for you just above the ridge where you start is a tree that holds a **Luojia Fragrant Vine** , and the Mountain Trail Shrine lies not far after. 

Temple of the Yellow Flowers Luojia Fragrant Vine

While resting at the Shrine, note that you can now craft the Spider Celestial Staff, which boasts an odd additional effect against enemies if you're currently poisoned. In fact, you can actually make this into an effective build by intentionally poisoning yourself with the Deathclaw Soak, and further boosting your skills by equipping the Elder Amourworm Spirit to increase critical hit chance when poisoned, but it is a bit of a risky tradeoff. 

After resting at the Shrine, you may start to notice giant pools of blood left by something on the run, meaning the Violet Spider must have come this way. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/96/Wukong_YellowFlower_3.jpg)

At the top of a short stairway, you'll encounter new enemies guarding a green Wisp - a Sword Daoist. They attack with flowing sword combos and even a wave of force from certain swings, but on the plus side they aren't very durable, and a sustained light attack combo is enough to put them down. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e8/Wukong_YellowFlower_4.jpg)

Further up the mountain path, you'll encounter a second type of fighter - the Fly-Whisk Daoist. More support than main attacker, they'll harass you with a variety of wind and force projectiles, and while you'll need to dodge the waves, you can deflect the smaller wind projectiles with your staff. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/87/Wukong_YellowFlower_5.jpg)

Heading up the steps to a large balcony, defeat another Fly-Whisk Daoist to find a small turtle-shaped **Treasure Chest** that holds a **Bee Mountain Stone Soak** for your Gourd. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7f/Wukong_YellowFlower_6.jpg)

Near the balcony, you'll find a large plaza where two Spear Daoists guard a building with a green Wisp, while a Snake Herbalist patrols the main path to the left. You'll find he strikes similarly to the Snake Patrollers in Black Wind Mountain, only he can use the poison pot on his back to toss out even more splashes of poison. 

Follow the blood trail that leads to the left and through a dark shaded corridor, and then up to another large open area. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b7/Wukong_YellowFlower_7.jpg)

While the blood trail quickly peels off to the right up another narrow pathway, there's a **Treasure Chest** up ahead that's guarded by a creepy half snake, half tiger known as a Snake Sheriff. The weird yaoguai can let loose a loud roar to increase its power, and then it will often raise its claws before leaping at you repeatedly unless deflected. 

After defeating the beast, head to the right up the narrow tree-lined trail to find a green Wisp and a few more Daoists guarding the pathway. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/eb/Wukong_YellowFlower_8.jpg)

Once you cross a bridge over the trail below, you'll head through a small tunnel and come out onto another large area lined with murals, one of which has a green Wisp to absorb, and another alcove that holds a **Treasure Chest** guarded by a second Snake Sheriff. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Wukong_YellowFlower_10.jpg)

You'll also see a hideous creature in monk robes stagger forth by the chest -- a Worm Practitioner. They'll attack haphazardly with a long tendril-like arm to deal poison damage, so you'll want to engage them cautiously. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cc/Wukong_YellowFlower_11.jpg)

After grabbing the Treasure Chest they were guarding, head right past a third green Wisp, and through a small ravine guarded by several Daoists to reach a large forested area. 

## Forest of Ferocity

After resting at the Forest of Ferocity Shrine, you'll see a group of Daoists off to the right practicing, with more voices coming from somewhere further up. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/52/Wukong_YellowFlower_13.jpg)

First, you should head left to defeat a Snake Herbalist, and then explore a far cliff where a small ledge holds a **Meditation Spot** where you can get a free Skill Point. 

The Height, Forest of Ferocity Meditation Spot

![Wukong YellowFlower 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/86/Wukong_YellowFlower_14.jpg)

Next, take the right path to defeat the group of Sword Daoists practicing, and beyond them you'll find two more Worm Practitioners by a broken building with a green Wisp. Defeat them both, and you should gain the **Virtuous Bamboo Engraving Curio**. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8d/Wukong_YellowFlower_15.jpg)

Look for a main stone path cutting through the forest, leading past another group of Daoists before the road curves right where a Snake Herbalist patrols. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/74/Wukong_YellowFlower_16.jpg)

Follow the pathway, and you'll find a set of stairs leading up to a large courtyard where a tough Yaoguai Chief is training a large group of Sword Daoists. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Battle - Commander Beetle

The Commander Beetle would be a fairly straightforward miniboss fight, if not for the six Sword Daoists he's currently training in the large courtyard where you'll find him just past the Forest of Ferocity. Unfortunately, these enemies will respawn until you defeat the Commander, so you won't be able to get him alone so easily. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d9/Wukong_YellowFlower_17.jpg)

Knowing that the Daoists don't have a whole lot of heath, there are two things you have on your side: large area-of-effect Spirit Attacks, and your Pluck of Many Spell. The Pluck of Many is a great bet for disorienting the group as you attack, though results can vary, and you'll likely have to jump in an finish off a few Daoists yourself. One is even likely to drop the **Fruit of Dao Soak** for your Gourd! 

This can get tricky, as the Commander Beetle won't just wait around patiently while you defeat his students. He can employ huge strikes that cleave the very ground in a line where he strikes, and if you aren't paying attention, you can usually get hit by the tremors before you know what's going on. 

Try to keep in view as much as possible while defeating the Daoists so you can prepare to dodge away from his moves. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/92/Wukong_YellowFlower_19.jpg)

Once it's down to a 1v1 fight, you'll find things a bit more approachable, though you should still be on guard. For all his talk of wanting to die, he's a very competent swordfighter, and uses his blades in a few distinct ways. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9f/Wukong_YellowFlower_22.jpg)

He can quickly charge at you in a lunging backhanded slice attack, which will result in a whirlwind of blade strikes all around him after a moment you'll also need to dodge. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/92/Wukong_YellowFlower_21.jpg)

As mentioned previously, the Commander Beetle can also perform of series of sword slams with his bigger left sword. The small line that extends from his strike won't look like much for a moment, until a large fissure erupts from the path of his weapon which he can do several times in a row. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2d/Wukong_YellowFlower_24.jpg)

Even when not slamming the ground, his bigger sword can also cut through the air to send a slicing wave of force at you from a distance, which comes out much faster than his slams, and can be done multiple times. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e1/Wukong_YellowFlower_18.jpg)

However, if he decides to hold his left weapon up by his face in a reverse grip fashion, it will become his shield, and he'll be able to soak any blows you try and land on him (even when Immobilized). Hit him too many times, and he'll launch into a swift two-hit counterattack. Luckily, you can counter his counter with a well-timed Rock Solid to throw him off. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/06/Wukong_YellowFlower_20.jpg)

Along with a variety of lunging attacks and dual-wield slashes, he also has a few unorthodox moves. If he tries to headbutt you by leaping on his side, resist the impulses to kick him when he's down. He'll recover from falling to the ground by doing a breakdancing kick spin while slashing with both swords to lift off the ground and damage you if you get close. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/87/Wukong_YellowFlower_23.jpg)

He can also adopt a ready stance and expel projectiles all around him. They'll fly about like angry gnats and threaten to deal several hits, but these are the kind of projectiles you can easily deflect with your staff spin. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3e/Wukong_YellowFlower_25.jpg)

Aside from this, he doesn't have too much else to worry about. As long as you can get rid of his students quickly, and react quickly whenever he swings the bigger sword, you can anticipate and retaliate against most of his moves. When he falls, he'll drop a Knot of Voidness, and you can claim his Commander Beetle Spirit. 

Commander Beetle

Before you leave this area and continue on the main path, be sure to check the building where the Commander Beetle was standing, and you'll find a small **Treasure Chest** box that holds the **Tablet of the Three Supremes Curio**. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/46/Wukong_YellowFlower_26.jpg)

You'll encounter a few more Spear Daoists as you continue up the stairway path, but you'll also need to be wary of lurking Snake Herbalists as well. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/77/Wukong_YellowFlower_27.jpg)

Be sure to look for a smaller path off to the right as you climb, and you can spot a lone **Treasure Chest** hiding in an alcove. 

## Temple Entrance

Once you reach the Temple Entrance Shrine, you'll finally be able to start exploring the Temple of Yellow Flowers, which is still a fairly spread out complex tucked into pathways further up the mountain. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/26/Wukong_YellowFlower_28.jpg)

Head up the stairs beyond the main gate, but check a small alcove to the left first to find a green Wisp guarded by some Worm Practitioners. Be ready to find many of these enemies around the temple, as more than a few of them hide in the tall grass by lying down until you approach. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e6/Wukong_YellowFlower_29.jpg)

At the top of the stairs, pass through the gate to enter the first courtyard. This large open area sports a large tree with a **Treasure Chest** straight ahead, while a blood trail leads along the main path to the left. 

First, however, we will take the right path to a large gateway along the yellow walls after grabbing the chest. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/70/Wukong_YellowFlower_30.jpg)

This inner hall is teeming with tons of Worm Practitioners all over the lower walkway, with a Snake Sheriff patrolling up some stairs ahead. On the plus side, many of the Worm Practitioners are lying out in the sun and won't react until you get close, so you can either ignore them, or sneak up to hit them with charge attacks before finishing them off. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f7/Wukong_YellowFlower_31.jpg)

Whether you want to kill every last one or not, be sure to at least clear out the far left side of the lower pathway first, and behind a tree you can find the final **Meditation Spot** for this temple area. If you remove all the enemies on the opposite side, you can grab a green Wisp and absorb it. 

The Pines, Temple of Yellow Flowers Meditation Spot

![Wukong YellowFlower 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c8/Wukong_YellowFlower_32.jpg)

Expect the lion-headed enemy to be tougher than the rest as you climb the first set of stairs, but defeating it will earn you the Snake Sheriff Spirit. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3b/Wukong_YellowFlower_33.jpg)

At the top of the other stairs, you'll find a small enclosed area where the Ancient Master sits alone, playing an instrument called the guqin. While you can talk to him about the Violet Spider, the more important item here is located just behind him in a glowing pot - an **Awaken Wine Worm** to add to your Gourds! 

Temple of Yellow Flowers Awaken Wine Worm

![Wukong YellowFlower 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0b/Wukong_YellowFlower_35.jpg)

Return back to the previous courtyard, and this time follow the blood trail to head up the left path. There will be a few Daoists trying to block your path, and once you head up the second set of stairs, be ready for an ambush on the right by a Snake Herbalist. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/53/Wukong_YellowFlower_36.jpg)

Once you head up the stone path where another Snake Herbalist patrols, you can find a tree next to a large stone boulder where the path diverges. To the left is the Court of Illumination Shrine -- your almost at the end of this area, but there's a very important thing to find by taking the other path first. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c8/Wukong_YellowFlower_37.jpg)

Go right at the fork in the road. Once you reach a large gate, take out the Worm Practitioner and look for a **Treasure Chest** it was guarding on the left before continuing to the next area. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5c/Wukong_YellowFlower_38.jpg)

Follow the winding mountain trail up several stairs and avoiding other Worm Practitioners until you reach the very top. The road will widen out as it follows a cliffside path toward a small shack with Snake Head Mushrooms all around it. One of these mushrooms... is not what it seems. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Fungiwoman

The Fungiwoman behaves almost identically to the Fungiman you fight fought in the Pagoda Realm (and a few times after), only they'll have a bit more health, and deal a bit more damage, but you should know what to expect for most of their attacks. Though they have a boss healthbar, they aren't tracked in your journal for Yaoguai Chief entries. 

When they rise out of their hiding spot, they'll flood the immediate area with poison, and can do so multiple times, so always be ready to back off when you see noxious fumes billowing up and swap to Thrust Stance. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5a/Wukong_YellowFlower_39.jpg)

The Fungiwoman can also expel toxic strands from its side to seek you out, but can thankfully by swept aside with a staff spin. The same can also happen if they slam their staff down, creating geysers that spawn additional projectiles. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/30/Wukong_YellowFlower_40.jpg)

Like the Fungiman, this variant can fly through the air to slam down from above on you, only with this move they'll also create poison geysers all around them to spawn the aforementioned projectiles. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f1/Wukong_YellowFlower_41.jpg)

Another move they share is their rapid spin attack that will seek you out. Keep your distance or use Immobilize to score free hits, and then wait until they fall dizzy to hit them with more attacks. 

For all their extra health, they don't have too many more moves than a regular enemy, so keep on the offensive so they don't have a chance to sprout more spore projectiles, using Immobilize to lock them down and Rock Solid when they try to swipe at you with their staff. 

Once defeated, you'll gain a Knot of Voidness, and a Monkey-Head Fungus Seed to take back to the Zodiac Village, as well as their Fungiwoman Spirit to absorb. 

Fungiwoman

![Wukong YellowFlower 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/75/Wukong_YellowFlower_42.jpg)

Be sure to check the shack on the far end before leaving, as you'll find the **Sunset of the Nine Skies Drink** sittng on a table, which will restore Qi as well as health! 

![Wukong YellowFlower 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bb/Wukong_YellowFlower_43.jpg)

As you head back down the path, look to the right when you reach the top of the stairs leading back down to the temple. A long slope here will send you down to a large arena, and its here you'll have your second and final encounter with an old foe - the Venom Daoist. 

## Boss Fight - Venom Daoist (Second Encounter)

In your last encounter with the Venom Daoist, he sported quite a bit of arms -- some of which you may have lopped off during the course of the fight. This time, he only has two extra arms, but the same rules still apply for this fight -- at least part of it. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 44.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/82/Wukong_YellowFlower_44.jpg)

In his first phase, he'll still use all the same moves you remember, including his most familiar crouching slash that hits twice before he leaps into the air to stab the ground. 

Just like before, this is also the best time to attack his extra arms, as you'll be able to deal a ton of damage and even jumpstart the second phase if you destroy them both. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 46.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ac/Wukong_YellowFlower_46.jpg)

Remember the timing of his other attacks, including his fast swipes before charging past you, then jumping back for another two hits. 

You'll also have to be ready to deflect or dodge if he crouches down with sword raised behind his head, as he'll dash forward and back at rapid speed. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 45.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/50/Wukong_YellowFlower_45.jpg)

A new move he can employ will have him toss one of his swords straight at you, then dash to pick it up while slicing with his second blade as he slides by. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 47.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/71/Wukong_YellowFlower_47.jpg)

Taking off one of his arms will deal a chunk of damage, but if you can try targeting both of his extra arms, removing them both will instantly deplete his health, and begin the second phase where demands a true fight: two arms vs two arms. 

He's got a lot more aggressive moves for this phase, and you'll need to be a bit more cautious as he has a lot less openings to retaliate than before. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 48.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8b/Wukong_YellowFlower_48.jpg)

To start, he often jumps up to float in the air a moment, tossing one sword after another at you, with the second sword landing a little farther past you. He'll then leap towards you and slash as he grabs both swords, ending with a mighty spinning slash to catch you trying to score a hit. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 49.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b5/Wukong_YellowFlower_49.jpg)

Be wary when he assumes a crouched stance with his swords up. He'll start walking forward while performing a series of twirling slashes, which can be tough to avoid as all six slashes come out very rapidly, so keep your distance or try to deflect them. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 53.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/41/Wukong_YellowFlower_53.jpg)

If his stance moves into holding both swords up high, he'll perform a similar combo string of four quick hits, followed by twirling both blades around him as moves forward to perform a final double slash that hits extremely hard -- again, making staying out of range your best bet. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 51.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2b/Wukong_YellowFlower_51.jpg)

His hardest hitting attack will come when he swaps to a reverse grip with his left sword, before dashing close to unleash three quick hits before flipping high into the air and slamming down for his "Flood of Blood" attack. Watch out for when he lands, as he'll also perform a last sweeping attack as he reorients himself. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 50.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/11/Wukong_YellowFlower_50.jpg)

Much of the rest of this fight will revolve around avoiding his lengthy combo attacks and retaliating after his last hit, or quickly evading or deflecting his charging dash attacks to stop him in his tracks. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 54.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/39/Wukong_YellowFlower_54.jpg)

Once the Daoist is defeated for good, he'll impart a mysterious message, telling you to "find the needle on Purple Cloud Mountain". As he departs, he mural will form on the nearby wall, which you can now interact with to travel to **Chapter 4's Secret Area: Purple Cloud Mountain**. As with other Secret Areas, we recommend exploring it before you proceed to the final boss of this chapter, as it will be instrumental in helping to defeat the final boss of this area. 

Venom Daoist (Temple of Yellow Flowers)

![Wukong YellowFlower 55.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/49/Wukong_YellowFlower_55.jpg)

Before you do, you should also head through the nearby gateway to find a large field with a giant tree in the middle. Off on the right, you can find a wooden ledge overlooking the mountains with a **Treasure Chest** full of random materials and a Soul Remigration Pill. 

## Court of Illumination

![Wukong YellowFlower X.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d6/Wukong_YellowFlower_X.jpg)

After you've completed Purple Cloud Mountain, head back to the Court of Illumination Shrine. If you haven't stopped here to get the Shrine earlier, you'll need to take out two Spear Daoists, but also note a small pond of water with a Tiger Sheriff down inside, along with a green Wisp. Defeating him should also get you a special **Tiger Tendon Belt Curio** (if not, it may randomly drop from other Tiger Sheriffs). 

![Wukong YellowFlower 56.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4e/Wukong_YellowFlower_56.jpg)

Now at the Court of Illumination Shrine, you'll find a pathway straight ahead, and another to the right leading to a large field. The doorway to the right leads to the final boss, so first take a quick detour up the stairs. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 57.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ea/Wukong_YellowFlower_57.jpg)

Up ahead, you'll find the final purple talisman altar, but before you approach it, look off to the left for a higher pathway guarded by two Sword Daoists. Defeat them and travel through the narrow rocky passageway up to a landing with a **Treasure Chest** that should contain a Knot of Voidness, Loong Aura Amplification Pellet and Life-Saving Pill, or other materials. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 58.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d9/Wukong_YellowFlower_58.jpg)

Head back to the altar, and pluck what should be the fourth and final talisman. Before you can celebrate this act, a large winged monster with a hand for a face will appear to aggressively punish you for this deed! 

## Boss Fight - Supreme Inspector

![Wukong YellowFlower 59.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0c/Wukong_YellowFlower_59.jpg)

In truth, this is only a prelude to an actual boss fight you won't encounter until much later, but it doesn't make the Supreme Inspector any less intimidating. He's got a ton of attacks that hit extremely hard, and even though you're supposed to "lose" this fight, you can end it by taking off 10% of his health. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 60.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/22/Wukong_YellowFlower_60.jpg)

With that in mind, do you best to dodge his wing attacks after he extends them slightly, and unleash everything you've got in your arsenal to try burning down that 10%.

If he takes to the air, play it safe and hang back, waiting to dodge when he divekicks his way back to you before trying to Immobilize and counter him. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 62.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cd/Wukong_YellowFlower_62.jpg)

If he tries to shoot out various wing-tip projectiles at you, don't panic and just use your staff spin to knock them all aside. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 63.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ac/Wukong_YellowFlower_63.jpg)

Once the battle comes to a conclusion, a Heron Noble will intervene, calling his attack... hand, off. He'll reprimand you (or Wukong) for your foolish acts, and despite destroying the altars, it seems they are set on keeping the Spider Sister who has been helping you from breaking free of her life in the Webbed Hollow. 

That's all you can do with him for now, but at the very least, you can now approach the table behind where the purple talisman altar was placed to find a **Celestial Nonary Pill** , increasing your stamina by a bit more!

Now that you've done all there is to do here, you can return to rest at the Shrine, and head toward the large field to finally catch up to the Violet Spider and her master, the Hundred-Eyed Daoist. 

## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master

The first time you approach this boss fight, you'll see the depths of the depraved power the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master possesses as he absorbs the Violet Spider into his being against her will. He'll transform into a centipede demon, using a large sword that he can imbue with electrical power to deal a ton of damage, and is also capable of both electrical blast attacks, and a few sneaky poison strikes. Because of this, it's better to have Shock-Quelling Powder on hand, but also be prepared to dip into your inventory to use Antimiasma medicine when its needed (which shouldn't be too often). 

As mentioned previously, it is extremely recommended that you complete the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret Area and get the Weaver's Needle Vessel, as you'll find defeating the boss in his final phase to be extremely difficult without it, more-so than any of the previous chapter bosses. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 65.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2c/Wukong_YellowFlower_65.jpg)

When the battle begins, the Violet Spider's daughters will launch into battle and try to battle with the Hundred-Eyed Daoist. You should absolutely use this period to help them out whenever possible and get your own hits in until the spiders are all defeated, but don't worry too much if you end up dying your first attempt. Even though the Spider Sisters won't reappear for subsequent attempts, The boss health bar will be permanently lowered by 15%, which is a pretty big boon to work with. 

Oddly enough, there's actually two small areas on either side of the arena you can't reach the first time due to the cutscene, but can explore before attacking him on subsequent attempts. To the right, you'll find some Daoists guarding a **Treasure Chest** with materials, and on the left you'll find a small pathway leading to the side of the arena with a green Wisp to absorb.

![Wukong YellowFlower 66.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b4/Wukong_YellowFlower_66.jpg)

Once the fight settles down to a 1v1, you'll get a better idea of his many attacks and how best to avoid them. He has a number of different sword sweep attacks he can do when you try a frontal assault, slicing downwards with a forward and backward slash, then spinning around quickly to perform a third hit. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 67.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b5/Wukong_YellowFlower_67.jpg)

He often follows this up by sending out the three paper talismans that float around his free hand to electrically charge the area in front of him before blasting it with a lightning strike, but by dodging to the side you can score several free hits as he draws out the animation. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 68.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b9/Wukong_YellowFlower_68.jpg)

Most times, he'll also begin the fight with stamping down with his two front talons, following up with a quick sword slash, and will then imbue his sword with lightning for a moment, before triggering a delayed downward slash to electrify you. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 69.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/76/Wukong_YellowFlower_69.jpg)

However, if you notice him swap to a reverse grip for his sword early on while leaning his head back, he'll quickly launch out a poison spray in a wide arc you'll need to quickly dodge behind him, or be ready to pop an antimiasma pill. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 70.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/30/Wukong_YellowFlower_70.jpg)

If he instead lets his sword float around the talismans to become imbued with lightning, be ready for him to toss the sword directly at you with quick speed. You'll have a moment to close the distance and get some hits in, but be ready when you see him raise his arms wide and begin to spin around as he advances, as his sword will reappear in his hand to perform two quick downward slashes, and then imbue his sword for a final slash (but you can deflect the two earlier slashes to stagger him). 

![Wukong YellowFlower 71.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b2/Wukong_YellowFlower_71.jpg)

Speaking of deflecting, it you favor the Rock Solid spell, do be warned that the Hundred-Eyed Daoist has a particular distaste for the skill. After you successfully use it to deflect his attacks, there's a good chance that he'll notice the move and say he "forbids" as he burrows into the ground. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 72.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/aa/Wukong_YellowFlower_72.jpg)

He'll then start coming for you while burrowed, which you can see by the disturbed earth heading in your direction. As lightning strikes, he'll leap out in an unblockable grab that deals major damage, and the timing can prove fairly difficult to dodge when you can't see or target him. We recommend running away while panning the camera behind you, and the exact moment you see a larger lightning strike behind you, dodge forward to avoid him as he bursts upward. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 73.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/50/Wukong_YellowFlower_73.jpg)

His other burrowing attack is equally damaging, though it comes less often. He'll start by tossing his sword at you, which will continue to spin wildly in a small circle near your position. As soon as you dodge it, immediately sprint away, as his tail will burst forth around the sword, spraying poison in nearly every direction. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 74.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/68/Wukong_YellowFlower_74.jpg)

The attack won't stop there, as once he re-burrows, you'll need to keep your eyes and ears peeled. After a brief moment, his electrified sword will come hurtling in from a corner of the arena with a small lightning strike noise, and you'll need to dodge it as it embeds itself in the ground. Stay clear of the impact site, as the boss will then burrow out to grab it and perform a quick double slash with the electrified blade before spinning about (at which you should then hop in and attack). 

![Wukong YellowFlower 75.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/dc/Wukong_YellowFlower_75.jpg)

As the fight rages on, expect him to employ a wider variety of both sword and electric attacks with his talismans, employing new combos to slice or slam, and then shoot out electric blasts or imbue his sword for bigger hits. One move to be wary of seems easy enough at first, as he'll charge up his sword by holding it close to his left side, and then unleash an upward lighting slash to his right. However, he'll immediately grab at you with his free hand, and squeeze the life out of you if you are too close to him following that first slash. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 76.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/af/Wukong_YellowFlower_76.jpg)

If he stabs his sword into the ground in front of him, he's actually hoping to bait you into deflecting your attack, which he'll counter with a charged electric stab. The good news is you can deflect him right back, just be ready for him to get mad and burrow down in response. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 77.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4e/Wukong_YellowFlower_77.jpg)

He can also hold his sword high up above him while charging it with lightning strikes. After a delay, he'll begin slashing the air in your direction, unleashing a low projectile wave followed by a diagonal slash wave, and then charge up his sword before jabbing it ahead to send a beam of lightning straight at you. It's better to keep your distance the moment you see him charging up, then dodge the three blasts before moving back in to fight. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 78.png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/61/Wukong_YellowFlower_78.png)

Finally, if he sheathes his sword entirely to concentrate on sending his electric talismans at you, prepare for a length barrage. As he performs a gesture with his hands low, he'll bring them up as he explodes with energy, and then send a salvo of electric talismans flying at you. 

If caught off guard, it's very hard to escape them once you first get staggered, but if you see the attack coming, step back and refresh your stamina, and then start spinning your staff to deflect the barrage until he's done. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 89.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/be/Wukong_YellowFlower_89.jpg)

You'll need to learn this fight carefully, as things will only get harder in the final phase, and you'll need as much of your healing gourd as possible. The good news is that despite his tendency to burrow after you deflect him, many of his attacks - even his poison spewing and many of his point-blank electrical talisman attacks can all be deflected by Rock Solid to stagger him. If you follow up with a charged 4 Focus Point hit, he may even fall to the ground, giving you a huge window to take out his health -- but we recommend saving your Transformation for the last part. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 79.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9d/Wukong_YellowFlower_79.jpg)

Once you've gotten him to around 25% of his health (right between the "M" and "a" in "Master", he'll clutch his head for an extended moment, and that's your cue to back off, as he'll no longer take damage for the moment. When he stabs the ground with his sword again, this time he'll channel a spell to bathe the arena in a golden dome. This is actually a great time to use any consumables you have on hand to buff yourself up, restore cooldowns or get back some Focus for the final phase. 

Despite this, the new phase won't actually begin until he grabs his sword again and charges at you, twisting his tail to slam down on you, and following up with two slow sword swings. Only then will a short cutscene play, and his true curse comes into play. 

At this point, he'll no longer use his sword, focusing entirely on his electric fists and tail, and somehow dealing even more damage in the process. To make matters worse, he'll massively reduce your maximum stamina while in this golden dome. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 80.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9f/Wukong_YellowFlower_80.jpg)

To free yourself, you'll need to use the Weaver's Needle Vessel. It will take a moment to work so be prepared to dodge his next attack while the needle begins to shoot all around him. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 81.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/af/Wukong_YellowFlower_81.jpg)

Once it hits, he'll be knocked to the ground, the curse will be broken, and you'll get a massive opportunity to attack him with everything you've got! Still, don't expect him to go down without a fight after the stun wears off. He's got more tricks than ever, and is able to create huge blasts that can end the fight quickly if you don't react fast. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 87.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/70/Wukong_YellowFlower_87.jpg)

His most common attack comes when he spreads his hands wide as they glow yellow. He'll lunge toward you, bringing up both hands to create a giant tremor in front of him, but it can be deflected with Rock Solid (he'll no longer burrow to retaliate so that's one less thing to worry about). 

![Wukong YellowFlower 85.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bb/Wukong_YellowFlower_85.jpg)

He'll also constantly end his three electric talismans out to distract you. Sometimes he'll shoot them straight out with a punch to add damage with a blast, but he can also hold them in front of him to create an even bigger blast, or send it around his back to slam down with his tail. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 84.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c2/Wukong_YellowFlower_84.jpg)

These attacks can be followed up often by him raising up on his claws while holding his electric orb high. After a moment, he'll slam everything down to create a massive shockwave that you need to either run from, or dodge at just the right moment (your Pillar Stance won't save you here). The good news is this blast leaves him very vulnerable for several moments afterward, once you get the dodge timing down. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 83.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ee/Wukong_YellowFlower_83.jpg)

If you see him perform an extravagant twisting somersault through the air, don't be dazzled, as he'll chain this feinting maneuver into a quick grab once he touches back on the ground and take a few step, lunging extra distance to try and yank you forward and take off a huge portion of your health with his crazy unblockable grab attack. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 86.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f0/Wukong_YellowFlower_86.jpg)

This is a good time to use your best Transformation Spell to help whittle down his health, especially if you're worried about the grab or are electrified and need to retreat. The Golden Lining transformation is a good bet for its shock resistance, and many of his massive attacks are slow enough that you can "see through" them to build up focus points and blast him back. If you haven't beaten Yellow Loong or aren't sure about his moves, you can also use Hoarfrost or Umbral Abyss to try freezing him, just be sure to keep on top of dodging his big blasts. 

The last piece of his health bar is by far the scariest to take down, and you'll need to constantly be watching his electrified talismans to anticipate where his next big blast is coming from. If you have extra mana, you can also try going for the Pluck of Mana, or just focus on more Immobilizations and Rock Solid Deflections. 

Once you've finally defeated the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, you'll be treated to the finale of the Spider Sisters and their mother. Note that you'll now gain all the Yaoguai Chief entries for the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Sister (despite you not having actually fought against them). 

Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master

With a bittersweet ending to this chapter, you'll gain the next piece of the Great Sage's Senses - the Envious Tongue, which has some interesting talents you can pick from: 

  * **Refreshing Taste** \- After consuming medicine, increases the Critical Hit Chance of the next attack.
  * **Spread the Word** \- Immobilize affects all enemies around the target.
  * **Tongue of a Connoisseur** \- Each equipped Soak slightly increases the Health recovery of the Drink.

Leaving the Webbed Hollow behind, your next stop will take you to the fiery wasteland of the **Flaming Mountains** in search of the fifth relic.
