# Baw-Lang Lang

Baw-Lang-Lang is one of the six frog bosses you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. The fifth of the frogs, Baw-Lang-Lang can only be discovered once you've taken down the Five Element Carts and gained access to Bishui Cave. 

## How to Find Baw-Lang-Lang

When you've beaten the Rusty-Gold Cart approach the frozen-over entrance and break through to head inside. 

This doorway will take you to the chapter's secret area called the Bishui Cave. We'd recommend completing this before you finish up the chapter. But there's one last miniboss to fight before you teleport to the secret area.

As you head inside the cave, go down the slope. You'll see a large structure in the center of the room that's being hit by the light. This is what will teleport you to Bishui Cave, but first, you'll want to look to the left. Here you can find the fifth of the frog bosses in the game, called Baw-Lang-Lang. 

## Baw-Lang-Lang Boss Fight and Guide

Much like other bosses in this Chapter, Baw-Lang-Lang favors fire attacks. And much like the other frog bosses, you'll see the same set of moves from Baw-Lang-Lang that include the tongue whip and leaping.

When Baw-Lang-Lang whips its tongue, it will be coated in fire. The frog will whip it left to right, or shoot it straight out at you. You can jump over its tongue or dodge the attacks. 

You'll then find it uses a leaping attack, where it swipes at you twice and then leaps up and over to you, to try and catch you. When it lands, a little burst of fire will emerge from underneath it.

Changes in its attack pattern will begin around the halfway mark, and it will lean up toward the top of the cave and spit fireballs all around it. Hang back as far as you can when this happens to avoid them. 

It will then start to breathe fire from its mouth as a jet, in which case, you'll want to get behind it and attack. Lastly, you'll see a change in its leap attacks. Wherever it jumps, it will send out small waves of fire in a circle around it. As you see it leaping, dodge and create distance between the two of you to avoid the circle of flames.
