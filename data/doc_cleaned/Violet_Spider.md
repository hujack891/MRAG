## Where to Find the Violet Spider

The Violet Spider is a required and non-missable boss in Chapter 4. She is the final boss of the Webbed Hollow Section, and must be defeated to progress to the next area. After you have reached the Lower Hollow and defeated Zhu Bajie to free him of his bewitching curse, he'll be abducted again. 

To reach him (and the Violet Spider), you'll need to ascend the Purfiying Spring outside the Hut of Immortality, and follow the trail upwards to The Gathering Cave where the spider queen awaits you. 

## Violet Spider Boss Fight and Guide

Much like The Second Sister, this boss will take the form of a gigantic and fearsome spider, and uses attacks in a few similar ways. She can lash out with her appendages, which will subtly shift into long blades but also give you a clue as to where her main attacks will come from. As you might expect, you'll also have to deal with dodging both poison and webbing, making mobility key to your survival.

The Violet Spider will often begin the fight with a signature webbing attack, shooting out several strands in a large frontal arc that you'll need to dodge or you'll waste time getting stuck and having to free yourself while being unable to do much else. Even if you do dodge the initial blast, there will be a web coating on the ground where the attack land that will slow you considerably, and you'll want to move the fight away from such spots as much as possible.

She'll often follow up her webbing with a poison attack, sending out a similar salvo of five poison projectiles that will seek you out rather quickly. The good news is you'll be able to use your staff spin to repel these heat-seeking gobs of poison, rather than having to dodge at the last moment.

The Violet Spider shares more than just the look of The Second Sister -- she also uses a few of the same moves with her talon-like appendages. This includes the feint of raising up her front leg to the side before performing alternating downward stabs, followed by a large leaping slam. 

The bad news is even if you've gotten familiar with these attacks, she often follows them by spewing poison right onto the ground in front of her, which will limit your ability to retaliate. Be sure to dodge to the side first before starting your attack to get out of the way of most of her poison.

The same goes for their shared moveset of leaping forward to stab straight ahead with two talons, as she'll quickly follow the stab with a concentrated poison spray right in front of her, which you can avoid by dodging to the sides rather than rolling forward or backward.

When she goes into a frenzy of stamping down all of her legs quickly, she'll do so while spewing out poison in several directions. Try to stay one step ahead of her by keeping to her right side, and watch for her final talon stab at her front to your right, sending out another plume of poison, but leaving the rest of that area exposed to a counter attack. 

She also has a nasty habit of rapidly twitching her body while standing still, only to suddenly pivot and slam her rear into you at full force, which can deal a ton of damage. Even if you're at range, expect webbing strands to fly out that you need to dodge or deflect with your staff spin.

One of her more insidious moves is another play on her webbing attack, where she'll laugh as she sends out strands from her back to slowly arc across the air and seek you out. She'll send these webbing strands out one after the other to try and both slow you down and also deal damage, ending with a huge wave of 12 projectiles in a large arc that all fly to you at once. If you're stuck trying to get out of her earlier webbing, you'll be a sitting duck, making evading the last salvo even harder.

Luckily, these strands all count as projectiles that can be deflected, meaning you need only stand your ground and spin your staff to knock each webbing projectile away as it comes, letting you evade both getting stuck and taking damage all at once. 

Rather annoyingly, while most attacks can be deflected with Rock Solid easily, they'll cause her to retreat backward by a good amount, and out of range or regular retaliations. It's better that you build up your Focus Points before trying to deflect her attack, and then immediately follow with a high powered heavy strike with your thrust or pillar stance to catch her as she retreats.

Similarly, you'll also need to be careful if you want to employ your Immobilizing spell, as you don't watch to catch her with her body too high in the air to hit. Try instead to catch her right after an attack where she ducks low to strike at you, and make the most of that time or after staggering her when she falls down.

Once she reaches about half of her health or less, you'll need to keep your eyes peeled for when she dives her head into the ground. This will leave only her rear abdomen sticking out of the ground, but resist the urge to smack at it. Zhu Bajie may try to warn you, but it may not come out in time that she's preparing a deadly poison explosion! 

![Wukong LowerHollow 81.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cb/Wukong_LowerHollow_81.jpg)

The poison blast has an extremely wide area of effect, and can be difficult to escape if you're still very close to her when she burrows in. Luckily, as long as you have a lot of stamina saved up, you can also negate the blast by using the Pillar Stance. It will likely take 50% of your stamina bar to soak, but you'll be free of any damage or poison! 

![Wukong LowerHollow 82.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c3/Wukong_LowerHollow_82.jpg)

At this point, her eyes will start to glow, signifying her second phase. Things will get very scary if her eyes start to glow even brighter and mesmerize you. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 83.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a0/Wukong_LowerHollow_83.jpg)

If this happens, you'll suddenly be transported to an illusory realm where you're on a bed of webs instead of solid ground. This can get extremely bad as the more you move around, the more you'll be slowed until eventually you'll be exposed as you try and break free of the webbing. 

Expect the Violet Spider to absolutely take advantage of your vulnerability in these moments, attacking with both her talons and a large jump slam attack that even staggers her for a bit. You'll need to stand your ground and use Rock Solid to knock away her blasts if you're unable to dodge them in time. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 85.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Wukong_LowerHollow_85.jpg)

The good news is this phase doesn't last forever, but you will need to survive it for about 30 seconds, so you should also consider utilizing Immobilize to trap her in place, or even a Transformation Spell to offload the damage onto a different form. 

Her eyes will stop glowing after you've been mesmerized once, so once the room is back to normal, continue to dodge her projectiles and get your hits in after her violent stabs and slam attacks. 

When the queen of spiders finally falls to your assault, she'll beat a hasty retreat to return to wherever she's hidden the Sage's Relic. You'll need to follow quickly, because a literal spider army will appear to give chase!
