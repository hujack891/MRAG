# Snowhill Path Walkthrough

Black Myth: Wukong's Chapter 3 begins in the freezing mountain trail toward The New West. Below you'll find a guide for the first major area of The New West: Snowhill Path, as well as how to win your first encounter with Macaque Chief, and defeat the mighty Kang-Jin Loong.

In Black Myth Wukong's third chapter, the Destined One will travel far from the arid deserts to the snowy mountaintops of The New West, where you'll spy an odd character masquerading as a statue. 

Once you've taken off your own disguise, you'll find yourself in a frozen cave full of giant statues with only one way forward. That way is blocked by a tough looking new enemy, the Monk Supporter. 

![Wukong Snowhill 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e1/Wukong_Snowhill_2.jpg)

These foes are fairly slow but durable, and will use the large stones they carry to try pummeling you with. Thankfully, they are fairly susceptible to being deflected with Rock Solid. 

![Wukong Snowhill 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a2/Wukong_Snowhill_3.jpg)

Head up the stairs at the end of the path to reach a high ledge in the cave, and on the way down you'll meet another new enemy. These Cyan Bats like to cling to ceiling and drop down to ambush you. While they are way less durable than the Swift Bats of the Yellow Wind Ridge, they can dive at you with their spears, or send ice attack projectiles your way that will try to inflict you with frostbite. If they try to dart out of reach, use the Thrust Stance to chase them down. 

![Wukong Snowhill 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a6/Wukong_Snowhill_4.jpg)

Be sure to look to the left as you head down from the ledge, and you'll find a small pool of water with some Jade Lotus, and another Monk Supporter guarding a**Small Chest** , likely containing some Cold Iron Leaves and other materials. 

![Wukong Snowhill 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f6/Wukong_Snowhill_5.jpg)

Head upwards to a break in the cave as the snowy wind billows down, and prepare for the low visibility to mask another Cyan Bat hiding around the corner. 

## Frost-Clad Path

![Wukong Snowhill 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/96/Wukong_Snowhill_6.jpg)

Grab the green Wisp and absorb it as you head up the final tunnel section of this cave, which will bring you at last to a large field of Snowhill Path. You can find some Gentian plants around here as you exit, and up ahead you can find the Frost-Clad Path Shrine. 

Like the previous chapters, this shrine has a whole new store for you to browse, and you'll also be able to start investing in crafting the Ochre Armor Set and Rat Sage Staff (or possibly the Loongwreathe Staff as well if you defeated the Red Loong and Black Loong in the previous chapters). These weapons will cost a fair amount of Will and other materials, so check your inventory often for when you have enough to upgrade, and also look into stocking up on new items: 

The New West Shrine Shop   
| The New West Shrine Shop            | The New West Shrine Shop              | The New West Shrine Shop            | The New West Shrine Shop             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Body-Warming Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Longevity Decoction (x3) - 270 Will |                                      |
| Mind Core (x4) - 1800 Will          | Cold Iron Leaves (x2) - 900 Will      | Refined Iron Sand (x1) - 1200 Will  |                                      |
| Aged Ginseng (x10) - 90 Will        | Fire Bellflower (x10) - 120 Will      | Tree Pearl (x10) - 180 Will         | Snake-Head Mushroom (x10) - 120 Will |
| Golden Lotus (x5) - 180 Will        | Celestial Pear (x5) - 240 Will        |                                     |                                      |

From the shrine, head up the path through the mountain. Compared to the previous chapter, you'll find this area much more linear like in Chapter 1. 

![Wukong Snowhill 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/36/Wukong_Snowhill_7.jpg)

As you reach a group of bodies frozen in the snow, a strange monkey will be alerted to your presence, throwing a piece of fruit at one of the corpses to awaken it from its slumber. 

Not all of the Frozen Corpses you'll find along this path will come alive, but those that do hold either spiked maces or very long blades, and will slowly swat at you or do leaping attacks with them. 

![Wukong Snowhill 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b2/Wukong_Snowhill_8.jpg)

Luckily, they don't have much health and are easily dodged -- but note that the Frozen Corpses with spiked maces will swing wildly a few times after they've been "killed" so street clear of their death throes. 

![Wukong Snowhill 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/39/Wukong_Snowhill_9.jpg)

You can head past the small building the other monkey was perched on, or swing around the back side to find a small alternate path. This area leads up to a large column with a green Wisp you can absorb, and two Frozen Corpses guarding it. 

![Wukong Snowhill 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e7/Wukong_Snowhill_10.jpg)

Head back up the main path through more Frozen Corpses, taking them on one at a time so you don't get overwhelmed. Once you reach the top of this area you'll find a large snowy field where the monkey is waiting for you. 

### Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Macaque Chief (First Encounter)

You can consider this one half of a real boss fight, since you won't actually defeat this miniboss here. Despite that, the Macaque Chief is not to be taken lightly. Many of his attacks inflict Frost, and if your bar fills, you'll have extremely reduced mobility and be unable to dodge many of his attacks. Plan ahead by crafting or buying Body-Warming Pills to offset this. 

![Wukong Snowhill 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ea/Wukong_Snowhill_11.jpg)

The Macaque Chief is fairly proficient with the giant curved blade he wields, and begins the fight by slamming it down to send a vacuum slice projectile right at you. 

![Wukong Snowhill 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/23/Wukong_Snowhill_14.jpg)

He can also heave his blade around that will send his body spinning, attacking with two quick spinning slice attacks. Often times he'll end up holding the blade with his foot, and perform a final upward slash as he backflips, sending out another projectile slash. 

![Wukong Snowhill 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/41/Wukong_Snowhill_12.jpg)

His one major attack will have him jump into the air and slam his blade into the ground, and then perform series of quick claw swipes in front of him with surprising reach, all while keeping close to the blade behind him -- meaning he can't really pivot if you dodge and attack from the sides. 

![Wukong Snowhill 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/23/Wukong_Snowhill_14.jpg)

He'll step back to grab the sword with his foot and jump onto its hilt, before preforming a quick roll along the ground to drag the sword in a whirlwind slice with a large reach to it, followed by a final downward slam, so don't press your attack too hard during this combo, or Immobilize him before the second part of his combo. 

![Wukong Snowhill 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/20/Wukong_Snowhill_15.jpg)

A longer deadly combo attack he can employ comes with three quick slashes ending in a jumping upward slash. After a brief pause in the air, he'll use his foot to send the blade slamming down vertically, and then yank it back up in an arc for a final two-hand diagonal slice attack. Your Rock Solid won't always stagger him mid-combo, so it's better to wait and parry the final slice so you can retaliate faster. 

![Wukong Snowhill 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/12/Wukong_Snowhill_16.jpg)

If he begins to hold the blade in both hands, prepare for an extended attack with three alternating slices ending in an upward swing with a long delay. When he finally brings the blade down, he'll do so in a spinning multi-hit slash, followed by a final slam to emit a projectile slash. 

![Wukong Snowhill 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c3/Wukong_Snowhill_17.jpg)

Once you get him to around half his health, he'll suddenly jump backwards in retreat, and start putting his hands together to signal mercy and defeat. 

![Wukong Snowhill 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e1/Wukong_Snowhill_18.jpg)

Do not be lured in by this gesture, as it's all an act -- as he'll eventually look up and use his tail to bring the blade up in an upward slash with a projectile slice at you! 

![Wukong Snowhill 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3b/Wukong_Snowhill_19.jpg)

Finally, if you spend to much time dishing out damage to his face, he'll eventually counter with an unexpected move: puking on you. This will deal an immense amount of poison buildup, so be ready to Immobilize or dodge around behind him. 

With his small frame, the Macaque Chief is fairly susceptible to being staggered with charged up heavy strikes. Build up your focus from light attack combos when dodging him, and then knock him down with big hits or after deflecting his moves. 

![Wukong Snowhill 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/59/Wukong_Snowhill_20.jpg)

When he runs out of health, you won't get the traditional "boss defeated" scene, and only earn some Will as the Macaque Chief retreats, turns invisible, and runs off toward the ruins above while taunting you. 

![Wukong Snowhill 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f0/Wukong_Snowhill_21.jpg)

With the area now clear, you're free to continue up the mountain path to a large walled temple in the distance. Once you reach the final set of stairs leading up to the temple, be ready for a Cyan Bat hanging from a nearby tree to ambush you. 

![Wukong Snowhill 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Wukong_Snowhill_22.jpg)

Climbing the stairs, be sure to look to the left for some broken wooden platforms you can jump to, and beyond them you'll find a **Treasure Chest** containing items and likely a few Refined Iron Sand. 

![Wukong Snowhill 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/51/Wukong_Snowhill_23.jpg)

Entering the large temple complex, there's actually not as much to explore as you might think. A large open area to the right leads to a sealed building, but guarding it is a new enemy - the Yaksha Patroller. 

![Wukong Snowhill 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bc/Wukong_Snowhill_24.jpg)

These formidable foes are pretty beefy, and use their wicked weapons to throw at you like boomerangs from a distance. They can also string long combo attacks together, requiring you to interrupt one with a Rock Solid deflection or wait until their final leaping slash or delayed uppercut to retaliate. 

Once the Patroller is down, you can find a green Wisp to absorb at the foot of the building to replenish your gourd, but there's not much else here. 

![Wukong Snowhill 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c0/Wukong_Snowhill_25.jpg)

Instead, return to the temple entrance and look for stairs leading upward. Be wary of more Frozen Corpses coming to life as you ascend, and another will try and ambush you from the left as you reach the next landing. 

![Wukong Snowhill 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e1/Wukong_Snowhill_26.jpg)

There's another Yaksha Patroller here waiting to challenge you, so try and isolate him first by luring the corpses down the stairs and then take him out. Once again, there's another green Wisp to absorb on the right to get some gourd healing back. 

As you head to the end of the raised platform, you'll find a snowy sloping path off to the right, and another stairway path going straight ahead. 

![Wukong Snowhill 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4c/Wukong_Snowhill_27.jpg)

Take the path straight first, and you'll find a supercharged Yaksha Patroller surrounded by a horde of Frozen Corpses, making this fight a lot harder than usual. Don't worry about conserving your power here -- let loose with your Pluck of Many and Spirit Transformations spells to even the odds as much as you can so you can take down all the extra enemies and then focus on whittling down the Patroller's health. 

![Wukong Snowhill 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b8/Wukong_Snowhill_28.jpg)

Once he dies, he'll drop the Mountain Patroller Spirit for you to absorb and get all your gourd's health charges back. As an added bonus, you can inspect this other sealed building to find a **Treasure Chest** on the left side, which usually contains a Blood of the Iron Bull and other items. 

Aside from a Ginsengling hiding in the ruins nearby, that's it for this route, so return back to the previous platform and head down the sloping path. 

![Wukong Snowhill 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f9/Wukong_Snowhill_29.jpg)

Look for an open covered platform to the left as you descend, and make a quick detour to inspect this area. A Cyan Bat is hiding in the rafters, and after luring it down and defeating it, you can loot one more **Treasure Chest** for an assortment of items. 

![Wukong Snowhill 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d3/Wukong_Snowhill_30.jpg)

Finally, head across the bridge to a large open area in the middle of this temple ruin, and you'll meet your new guide for this region, who calls himself the Keeper of the New West. 

![Wukong Snowhill 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f2/Wukong_Snowhill_31.jpg)

With little warning, he'll transform you into a bat, and have you follow him across the mountain pass to take in the sights (unlike your brief transformation into a cicada, you can't control this part). 

## Mirrormere

When at last you reach your destination and return to monkey form, you'll find yourself at the foot of the Mirrormere Shrine. The Keeper of the New West will bid you to plunder the small temple on the frozen lake to find the next Sense of the Great Sage. 

Before you do that however, there's a couple things to check out before crossing the giant frozen lake. 

![Wukong Snowhill 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/ff/Wukong_Snowhill_32.jpg)

First, start by exploring the area to the right when facing the lakeshore. You'll find assorted materials to harvest here, including **Fire Bellflowers** and a **Celestial Pear** tree in the far corner. Be on the lookout for a few scattered Frozen Corpses as you explore, and a Cyan Bat or two hiding up in the trees. 

Though the massive frozen lake expanse is largely empty, there is one thing worth stepping onto the ice for while on the right side. Head around a section of impassible rocks when stepping onto the ice, and run around past it to find a small alcove section with a small tree along another shore on the right. 

![Wukong Snowhill 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1f/Wukong_Snowhill_33.jpg)

The base of this tree holds a small turtle chest on a stone table, and inside you'll find the **Stranded Loong's Whisker Soak** for your Gourd, which will increase the duration of your Immobilize spell! 

![Wukong Snowhill 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Wukong_Snowhill_34.jpg)

Returning to the Mirrormere Shrine, this time go left when facing the shore. There's a few more plants to harvest, but the bigger attraction here is a larger group of Frozen Corpses in a field leading to the shore. You'll need to rouse and defeat the entire group, and doing so will earn you an exclusive reward - the **Mani Band curio** , which can help you out when fighting frost-inflicting enemies. 

You'll also find a small **Treasure Chest** nearby, and you can loot it for assorted items that may include a Mind Core and possibly Refined Iron Sand. 

![Wukong Snowhill 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d9/Wukong_Snowhill_35.jpg)

Finally, head to the right of where all the Frozen Corpses were gathered to find a large gnarled tree hanging over the frozen water, and a **Meditation Spot** below it you can rest at for a free Skill Point Spark. 

That's pretty much all you can do in this area, so now you can head toward the ominous temple in the middle of the lake, only to be surprised by what appears to the lord of this land returning. They've got a back that seems to hold many surprises inside, and will share one with you - a mighty Yaoguai Queen! 

## Yaoguai Queen Boss Fight - Kang-Jin Loong

![Wukong Snowhill 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9a/Wukong_Snowhill_36.jpg)

A majestic and terrifying Loong Dragon, Kang-Jin Loong will fly about the arena, making her a tricky foe to pin down. Even when she returns to a "resting" state, she'll usually be off the ground, and will regularly pull back her head out of reach. Expect her to deal a lot of shock damage, so stock up on shock-quelling medicine or you'll be taking double damage for a lot of this fight. 

![Wukong Snowhill 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9c/Wukong_Snowhill_37.jpg)

Kang-Jin Loong will often begin the fight by racing right at you headfirst, so be ready to dodge to the side. If you can time things right, Immobilize can pin her in place long enough to get some hits in. 

Get your hits in on her face when she returns to float in front of you, and be ready for the boss to whip around and prepare new attacks. 

![Wukong Snowhill 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/ff/Wukong_Snowhill_38.jpg)

If she starts to rapidly fly in circles, dodge back and you'll avoid a whirlwind attack that has a fairly large range outside of her actual body. 

![Wukong Snowhill 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c7/Wukong_Snowhill_39.jpg)

She can also lunge toward you while clawing the ground on both sides of her body as she passes. Each spot she hits will erupt with a bolt of lightning, so you'll need to avoid her charging body without rolling into these spots on accident, and be ready for a secondary charge from above as she does it again. 

![Wukong Snowhill 46.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c3/Wukong_Snowhill_46.jpg)

Certain times, her slamming attacks to create lightning strikes can end with her making a quick spin to emit a blast of lightning from her mouth. She'll pivot slowly to spread the breath in front of her, but this can be avoided by gaining height using the Pillar Stance. 

![Wukong Snowhill 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/87/Wukong_Snowhill_40.jpg)

If she slams a claw into the ground without flying around, it means she'll drag that claw towards you, building up energy to send an electric shockwave in your direction, but it can be easily dodged to the side. 

![Wukong Snowhill 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fc/Wukong_Snowhill_41.jpg)

However, this is just part one of her attack, as after a delay she will slam down with her tail for a massive attack -- but it can be deflected with Rock Solid. 

After her tail slam, you'll have the opportunity to retaliate and hit her tail before the boss can re-orient her body, so make the most of these moments to use Spirit Attacks while its on the ground. 

![Wukong Snowhill 47.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/66/Wukong_Snowhill_47.jpg)

Another wild tail slam attack will come when the boss rapidly spins in a front circle while facing you, building up momentum from several rotations to finally slam their tail down from above. 

![Wukong Snowhill 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/44/Wukong_Snowhill_42.jpg)

Be wary when Kang-Jin Loong begins to roar and emit lightning all around, as they can perform an attack to summon a series of lightning strikes along the ground. They'll track your position, so keep strafing and dodging to outpace them, and don't worry about fighting while in this evasive mode. 

![Wukong Snowhill 45.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/eb/Wukong_Snowhill_45.jpg)

Other times, with a particularly loud roar, the boss will summon a giant circle of lightning strikes all around them. They only hit a few times in different spots, and usually at a fair distance from the boss, so pursuing it and keeping close is often the way to go. 

Much of this fight is about patience and waiting for the right time to strike back, as you don't want to waste time swinging wildly when there's no hope of reaching the boss. Let them come to you, and look for the right moments with stationary claw swipes or tail slams to deflect with Rock Solid for a better chance to stagger them. 

![Wukong Snowhill 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c8/Wukong_Snowhill_43.jpg)

Using the Pillar Stance is a great bet for this fight since you'll have both increased height and range on your strikes even if your lock-on isn't on the exact right spot that might cause your Thrust Stance to miss. Hit them hard enough with a few Focus Points banked, and you can often send her staggering to the ground. 

![Wukong Snowhill 44.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f4/Wukong_Snowhill_44.jpg)

Any time you manage to knock the dragon to the ground, quickly capitalize on the moment with Spirit Attacks and as many hits as you can unleash, using Immobilize to keep her grounded for a long as possible. 

![Wukong Snowhill 48.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a5/Wukong_Snowhill_48.jpg)

When you finally deplete the bosses health, you'll send her into the icy depths below the lake. 

Unfortunately, you'll also be sent deep down, and after a cutscene, you'll find yourself in a terrifying jail known as **The Pagoda Realm**.
