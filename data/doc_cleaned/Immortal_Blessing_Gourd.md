# Immortal Blessing Gourd

The Immortal Blessing Gourd is one of the strongest Gourds in Black Myth: Wukong, with one of the most unique abilities out of the entire range of them. Due to its strength, and the fact it has 8 uses by default, the Immortal Blessing Gourd can't be upgraded. 

When you have the Legendary Immortal Blessing Gourd equipped, your health recovery is actually halved. However, your attack is increased for a short duration after using it, allowing you to deal significantly more damage than you would normally. This is a huge tradeoff, however, so it won't be for everyone, and you may want to opt for another Gourd in the game or the traditional Old Gourd, which you can upgrade to the Supreme Gourd. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Immortal Blessing Gourd location

The Immortal Blessing Gourd can be bought from the Shen Monkey Vendor in Black Wind Mountain from the start of Chapter 5 onwards. You will need to obtain the Buddha's Right Hand material from the boss of the same name in The Webbed Hollow, as well as the Buddha's Left Hand from Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw in The Webbed Hollow's Lower Hollow. 

Buddha's Right Hand is a mandatory boss during the chapter, so you can't miss them. However, Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw is completely optional, found by the Lower Hollow Shrine. Our walkthrough of the Lower Hollow will take you through how you can find him from the boss fight with the Buddha's Right Hand.

With both of these bosses defeated, at the start of Chapter 5, you can return to the Shen Monkey Vendor to buy the Immortal Blessing Gourd.
