## Falcon Hermit Location

Instead of continuing up the steps to the Warding Temple from the Warding Temple Keeper's Shrine, turn to the side and drop down to the snowy hill below. Start working your way up the hill. The Falcon Hermit will appear on top of a rock on the left.

## Falcon Hermit Fight Guide

Falcon Hermits are difficult to fight at the best of times. They aren't bosses, but they are one of the more tricky foes to tussle within Black Myth: Wukong. Falcon Hermits have both wings and fans that work together to send out a large variety of wind-based moves. There is a corkscrew charge move that hits hard and fast, a tornado move that travels around the area, razor-sharp wind gusts, and blunt damage moves inflicted by the Falcon Hermit's fan weapon. 

Immobilize can drastically help when fighting a Falcon Hermit, and always keep your eyes peeled for wind-based attacks. These can easily blend in with the snowy surroundings of the mountain.

  * **Frosty Wind**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Frost Damage

The Falcon Hermit's Spirit allows you to make use of his wind tornado move. This tornado travels around the area, damaging anything it makes contact with. It has a pretty decent lifespan, allowing you to potentially damage many enemies at once and freeze them so you can land some combos on them before they recover. The Falcon Hermit's equipped effect boosts your Frost Damage, making the Hoarfrost transformation spell more powerful.
