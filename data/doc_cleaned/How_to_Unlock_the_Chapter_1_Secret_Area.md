# How to Unlock the Chapter 1 Secret Area

Black Myth: Wukong is full of secrets, including hidden areas that can only be unlocked through solving a puzzle or finding a key item. One such secret area is in Chapter 1 and requires ringing three bells to access it. On this page, you'll find information on how to find each of the three bells and what awaits you in the hidden temple. 

## How to Find the Three Bells

If you've been exploring every part of Chapter 1 thoroughly, you’ll likely encounter two of the bells before you’re even told about them. That being said, you might not have rung them. It’s not until the fight with the Whiteclad Noble that you’ll hear a riddle and then be prompted to find the three bells. If you're not sure where to find them all, here's where you need to look: 

## Bell 1

The first bell can be found in the Forest of Wolves. Start from the **Keeper's Shrine at Outside the Forest** and head straight up. 

Go past the two wolves and where the path branches off, then go right toward the bridge and the lone wolf guarding it.

At the bridge, you'll see a large rock on the other side. Go around the rock and to the other side to find a path lined with fires.

Follow the fires toward the entrance to the arena where you'll need to fight Yaoguai Chief Guangzhi. You'll need to defeat him to gain access to the area and ring the bell. It can be found at the back of the arena.

The second bell can be found in Bamboo Grove. Start from the Snake Trail Keepers Shrine and take the stairs up and go across the bridge. 

Follow this path down and past the river until you loop underneath the bridge you just crossed. Stick to the path until you reach the open area with the bamboo, and look for the path straight up ahead.

Follow the fires again as they curve off slightly to the right, to reach the arena where you'll need to fight Yaoguai Chief Guangmou.

Once you've beaten Guangmou, take the stairs at the back of the arena up the bell and ring it.

## Bell 3

The final bell can be found in the Marsh of the White Mist. After the fight against the Whiteclad Noble, don’t go toward the building that leads to the Black Wind Cave.

Instead, go to the left and through the small cave to find the final bell. It'll be at the end of the path, where a wolf hangs from the nearby tree. 

## How to Enter the Secret Area in Chapter 1

Once you've rung the three bells, you'll be automatically transported to the Secret: Ancient Guanyin Temple. Go up the stairs and there will be a Keeper's Shrine for you to interact with. You can then proceed, where you can take on Elder Jinchi the secret boss of the area.

When the fight is over, you'll be taken back to the bell that was near the Whiteclad Noble in the Marsh of the White Mist.

You can now interact with the wolf that hangs from the nearby tree, to pick up the Fireproof Mantle.
