# Chapter 1 Secret - Ancient Guanyin Temple Walkthrough

The Ancient Guanyin Temple is a Secret Area found in Chapter 1's Black Wind Mountain of Black Myth Wukong. Below you'll find a guide to accessing the temple with all three bell locations, and how to defeat the secret Yaoguai King boss, Elder Jinchi. 

This Chapter 1 Secret can only be accessed by ringing three large bells found around Black Wind Mountain, and will transport you to a different location to fight the secret boss that possess a magical item that is instrumental in defeating the Black Wind King. 

## How to Access the Ancient Guanyin Temple

The only way to be transported to this secret area in Chapter 1 is by locating and interacting with three bells found around the Black Wind Mountain region. They can be rung in any order, and ringing the third bell will automatically transport you to the Secret Area, which you can then fast travel to and from as you wish. The three bells are located in the following regions: 

![Wukong Wolves 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3e/Wukong_Wolves_42.jpg)

  * **Forest of Wolves** \- From the Outside the Forest Shrine, you can head up the left path to a higher road leading to a rope bridge across a stream. Follow the path straight past the bridge to find an optional Yaoguai Chief named Guangzhi who drops the Red Tides Transformation Spell. At the far end of the arena, you’ll find the first bell.

  * **Bamboo Grove** \- At the end of the Snake Trail area before reaching the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll face a Yaoguai Chief named Guangmou who can summon snakes to attack you. Once defeated, the path up to the next Shrine will be on the right, but if you head some some stairs to the left of the grove, you’ll find the second bell.

  * **Bamboo Grove** \- Traveling through the very short region of the Marsh of the White Mists, you’ll have to defeat a character boss, the Whiteclad Noble. Once he retreats, look for a path off to the left instead of heading straight into Black Wind Cave, and you’ll find a large plaza past the marsh where several Wolf Guai sit before a wolf that has been hung from a tree. Just beyond them is the final bell.

Ringing all three bells will transport you back in time to an earlier version of the Guanyin Temple, presumably shortly after it was set on fire long ago. Despite looking similar to the area you explored previously to fight the Yaoguai King, Lingxuzi, you’ll find new items at the entrance. 

![Wukong Guanyin 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2d/Wukong_Guanyin_3.jpg)

Activate the shrine in the entrance plaza, and then be sure to look around this area before proceeding inside. Opposite the Shrine, look around the other withered tree for three nearby chests that hold lots of Will, 2 **Yarn** , 3 **Stone Spirit** , and **Guanyin’s Prayer Beads** arm gear. 

You will also find that unlike the rest of Chapter 1, the Keeper's Shrine here sells a unique selection in the shop only purchasable at this Secret Area, and it's worth stocking up on the items since they're pretty rare for this point in the game: 

Ancient Guanyin Temple Shrine Shop   
Evil Repelling Medicament (x2) | Longevity Decoction (x2)   
Silk (x2) | Yaoguai Core (x2)   
  
Note - Before facing this boss, be sure to defeat the optional **Wandering Wight** that is found in the Forest of Wolves region of Black Wind Mountain if you haven’t faced him already. Not only does he share many attacks with this secret boss, but defeating this one will cause the Wandering Wight to disappear, and you will not be able to gain the Curio and Spirit that the Wight drops.

## Yaoguai King Boss Battle - Elder Jinchi

If you fought the Wandering Wight then the good news is you’ll have a good idea of what to expect in this fight, as he shares many of the same moves. That said, he does hit harder and can empower certain moves, so don’t assume this will be a cakewalk. You’ll want to have upgraded your staff after defeating the Whiteclad Noble to dish out more damage, and using the Wandering Wight’s Spirit on this guy can help tremendously. 

![Wukong Guanyin 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/19/Wukong_Guanyin_4.jpg)

The big twist on this fight that you’ll notice immediately is all the wandering bronze-colored corpses milling about the arena. The good news is they actually aren’t a threat — at least at first. This means you can focus on attacking the boss without worrying about one of them randomly clawing at you, but there’s more to it than that. 

Though you can’t directly target them, you can kill them with a single swipe of your staff. Doing so will actually cause their spirit to be directly absorbed, and heal you for a small amount. It’s not enough that you should be turning your back to the boss to seek them out exactly, but there are situations where you’ll need to distance yourself from Jinchi’s tremor and earthquake attacks that provide a pause in combat where you might as well hit one nearby to get a bit of your health restored. That’s not all these corpses do, but we’ll get to the rest in a bit. 

![Wukong Guanyin 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e8/Wukong_Guanyin_6.jpg)

As previously mentioned, Jinchi shares a lot of moves with the Wandering Wight. He can perform one or several spinning attacks that can be hard to judge the range of their attack, and can combo them into other moves like one or two stomp attacks, or a frighteningly fast jumping stomp attack. 

![Wukong Guanyin 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/23/Wukong_Guanyin_5.jpg)

He can also perform the palm blast wave after charging up, only Jinchi will also summon all of the wandering spirits to increase the power of his blast and delay its attack, which you’ll really want to be careful to dodge at the right time. 

![Wukong Guanyin 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fb/Wukong_Guanyin_11.jpg)

The Wandering Wight’s most annoying attack to deal with also returns, as Jinchi can raise his fist high and then slam it down, creating a single shockwave blast, or keeping his hand in the ground to erupt the ground at farther distances up to three times (which is a good time to run away and hit any wandering corpses). Seeing him raise up his hand for this attack is one of the best times to try **Immobilizing him** and dealing enough damage to stagger him out of the attack before he can truly start it. 

Similarly, you can use the Wandering Wight’s Spirit Attack to quickly stagger Jinchi, which is great for breaking him out of otherwise dangerous moves - provided you do so before the attack lands since it can still hurt your health bar. 

![Wukong Guanyin 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/17/Wukong_Guanyin_7.jpg)

After losing a bit of his health, the Elder Jinchi will get mad, often proclaiming you’ve stolen some treasure from him, and command his followers to attack. Now, finally, the shambling bodies will finally become a threat, and begin to glow as they chase you. 

The good news is they don’t move all that fast, and must stop for a moment before finally exploding. All you need to do is lead them on a merry chase, and zigzag around to cause them to begin to explode before dashing away. Once no more glowing zombies are near you, resume your fight against Jinchi. 

![Wukong Guanyin 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2c/Wukong_Guanyin_9.jpg)

Once Elder Jinchi reaches around half of his health, he’ll suddenly teleport away, reappearing in the middle of the arena and adopting a praying pose hovering too far up to reliably reach. All of the shambling bodies in the arena will be removed, but it’s when they start to reappear that you’ll need to be ready. 

In this segment, the bodies will slowly walk toward Jinchi in the middle of the arena, appearing slowly at first, but soon swarming from all sides. If any of them reach a spot close to the center, they’ll be absorbed by Jinchi giving him part of his health bar back. 

![Wukong Guanyin 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/42/Wukong_Guanyin_10.jpg)

The only thing you can do is beat Jinchi to the punch. Start sprinting around the arena the moment you spot a body, and use a single attack to defeat them and steal their health instead. You’ll have to race back and forth, so conserve your stamina by only using quick attacks before getting back to sprinting. 

Once enough have been absorbed by either you or him, he’ll return to the ground and the fight will resume. 

![Wukong Guanyin 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/77/Wukong_Guanyin_12.jpg)

So long as you deny him opportunities to restore his health, and watch out for when his followers are activated, you only need to keep up the assault and shut down his ground slams or stay far away when they happen. Save your Red Tides transformation spell for right after his healing segment so you don’t waste any time in that form killing walking corpses. 

![Wukong Guanyin 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/aa/Wukong_Guanyin_13.jpg)

Once Elder Jinchi is defeated, you’ll automatically be returned back to the third bell in the Marsh of the White Mist. You can now interact with the Wolf Guai hanging from the tree, causing it to turn to dust, and rewarding you with the Fireproof Mantle Vessel, and 2,000 Will.

Vessels are extremely rare and special items that not only provide a passive bonus, but can be activated when you’ve built up Ki from attacking enemies. Most Vessels are gained from completing a Secret Area’s boss fight, and will give you a huge situational advantage on the boss of that same chapter. The Fireproof Mantle allows you to negate fire damage attacks, which is what the final boss of this chapter will try to use against you!
