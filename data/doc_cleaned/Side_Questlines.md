# Side Questlines

Black Myth Wukong features a small collection of characters and items that you can meet who have their own small Side Questlines that you can pursue independently of your main objective in each Chapter. These Questlines are not tracked, and can be easily missed if you don't explore each chapter thoroughly or miss out on speaking to particular characters or using a Key Item in the right place. 

Below you will find a list of all known Questlines, how to start them, and what they unlock. Select a questline from the list below to learn more.
