# Stone Essence

The Stone Essence is one of the more hidden Key Items in Black Myth: Wukong. It is dropped by a secret boss found in Fright Cliff and you will need it to help the Man-In-Stone within the same area.

The Stone Essence can be found at Fright Cliff - Rockrest Flat. Just before the Shrine, you will see a small pathway leading into a cave. At the end of this cave, you can find the Mother of Stones. Defeating her will cause her to drop the Stone Essence.

However, if you have it, you are probably wondering where you can use it. 

## Where To Use The Stone Essence in Black Myth: Wukong

With the Stone Essence in hand, you can give it to the Man-In-Stone, who is located along the central path between the two raised paths from the Fright Cliff - Squall Hideout Shrine.

Giving it to him will cause him to stand up and he will tell you to go away. However, you can now target him and kill him, which is what you should do to get the Azure Dust Transformation Spells.
