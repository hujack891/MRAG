# Red Tides

Red Tides is one of the Transformation Spells found within Black Myth: Wukong. It is one of the most powerful Transformations you can find within the game's early chapters, thanks to its extremely strong heavy attacks. 

The Spell allows you to transform into a wolf guai and inflict Scorch Bane on the enemy with each attack. Red Tides' moveset is as follows: 

  * **Light Attack: Moon Dance - Continuously slash at the enemy building up Focus.** This is a fast flurry of swings with Red Tides' blade that can stun-lock an enemy and catch them off guard from behind.

  * **Heavy Attack: Moon Chase - Unleash a series of dash attacks.** This attack can be performed with or without focus to dash across an area, performing a potent strike as you do so.

  * **Follow Dodge With Heavy Attack - Perform a powerful set of slams after dodging.** This is Red Tides' strongest move, consisting of a slam. Several vertical slams can devastate an opponent's or boss' health bar and can be performed by repeatedly performing a Heavy Attack after using the first one following a dodge.

## Black Myth: Wukong Red Tides Location

Red Tides can be obtained by defeating Guangzhi in Forest of Wolves - Outside the Forest area in Black Wind Mountain. He is located at the far back, past the small bridge in the forest. 

This is an optional boss, and with him being accessible so early in the game, you may struggle. However, our Guangzhi boss guide will help you out.
