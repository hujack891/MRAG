Yaoguai Core can be found throughout the game's six chapters in the following locations: 

  * Occassionally found in Chests
  * Dropped from Yaoguai Chiefs, Kings, and enemies
  * Bought from the Shrine Store
  * Rewarded upon completing chapters

You will likely find a lot of them in the middle of your playthrough. Be sure to hold onto them to craft new gear as your progress.
