# A Thousand Days Inebriation

The A Thousand Days Inebriation Drink is the last drink you will likely come across in your Black Myth: Wukong playthrough. Out of all of the Drinks, the effect of this one is the most unique actually debilitating you briefly, alongside healing you. 

That Debilitation is whenever you take a sip of the Drink from your Gourds, you cannot move momentarily. This is incredibly punishing, as a wrongly-timed heal could cause your death. But, the tradeoff for this is that each Sip will heal a staggering 60% of your health. Therefore, this Drink is incredibly strong, and a skilled player who is able to choose the right moment to heal can breeze through fights with this equipped. 

Drink potency can be increased by finding the Awoken Wine Worm locations around the game's areas. Our page has all of their locations for you. 

You can then use these special Crafting Materials to upgrade them at the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove within Black Wind Mountain. Each upgrade will provide a sizeable buff to your healing potential and the unique effect, but as you level the Drink up, more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed. 

This carries over to New Game Plus too, as you can upgrade your Drinks even more, but once again more Awoken Wine Worms will be needed, so you will have to recollect them all in your New Game Plus run. 

## Black Myth: Wukong A Thousand Days Inebriation Location

The A Thousand Days Inebriation Drink can be bought from the Shen Monkey Vendor in Bamboo Grove in Black Wind Mountain after completing Chapter 5 in the Flaming Mountains. Upon resting at the first Shrine in Chapter 6, you can return to the vendor and grab the Drink for 9,000 Will. 

There aren't too many Drinks in the game compared to the Soaks, so be sure to keep your eye out for them. For even more guides on these areas, check out our full Black Myth: Wukong walkthrough.
