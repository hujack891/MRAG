## Black Myth: Wukong Jingubang Location

Jingubang can be found in Chapter 6 in Mount Huaguo upon defeating Gold Armored Rhino, Cloudtreading Deer, Feng-Tail General, and Emerald-Armed Mantis. All of these are mandatory bosses. When defeated you can use the Somersault Cloud to head towards the trees with golden leaves and then the waterfall to progress the chapter as you reach the end.

Weapons can be crafted throughout the game from the Shrines throughout the game's six chapters. Crafting weapons will require Will and various Crafting Materials from the game's locales and enemies. Jingubang can't be crafted, however.
