From the Mantis-Catching Swamp, fly up and back toward the area where you fought the Gold Armored Rhino and Cloudtreading Deer. We now want to stop on the left, to get the Son of Stones, which is the boss sitting at the edge of the cliff on the left with the neon blue glow. 

## Son of Stones Boss Fight and Guide

Land behind the Sone of Stones on the cliff and then attack to start the fight. He won't immediately jump up, so you can get a couple of free hits in.

When he does join in, you'll want to watch out for the standard stone boss attack of swiping at you with one hand. In the Son of Stones's case, he will fall over, but will continue to roll toward you, which will damage you if you're hit by it. At the end of this attack, he has to get himself back up, so quickly Immobilize him when he's down to take advantage of the situation.

Unlike other stone bosses, the Son of Stones mostly uses an elemental attack. The blue glow coming from him is in fact a charge, and he will throw out projectiles or summon waves of lightning to crash down around him. Have Shock-Quelling Powder equipped to combat any lightning damage he might inflict.

When the lighting attacks begin, get as far away from them as possible. He will start to lift his arms up and the lightning will get more intense, eventually ending in an explosion. As he does this, he will knock himself out and fall to the ground. The recovery from this attack takes a while, so dash at him and attack as much as you can. Here's a good opportunity to use Pluck of Many to maximize the time he's down for.

When he gets back up, use the Plantain Fan to stagger him and remove the lightning attacks and then folow up.
