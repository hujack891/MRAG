# Skandha of Thought

The Skandha of Thought is one of the rare Key Items in Black Myth: Wukong hiding a secret item and boss. Despite collecting the Skandha of Thought in one of the earliest chapters, you won't actually be able to use the item until the last section of the game in Chapter 6. 

_"Once hidden inside the Buddha's head, this treasure has a secret yet to be revealed."_

The Skandha of Thought can be found in the Valley of Ecstasy in Mindfullness Cliff in The New West. From the Shrine, head along the cliff and jump down to the lower cave area beneath you.

Follow the path all the way along and onto the snowy hillside. You will loop back into another cave and see a Buddha head at the top of a small staircase. Interact with it to get the Skandha of Thought.
