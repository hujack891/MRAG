## Puppet Spider Location

Head to the Verdure Bridge Keeper's Shrine and take the green bridge on the left of it. Head right and drop down the wooden platforms to reach the ground below. Instead of climbing the stairs to enter the village, turn right and head into a webbed corridor. Turn left at the illuminated spot in the corridor to find a secret entrance covered in cocoons. Destroy the cocoons to fight your way inside and find the Puppet Spider waiting for you there.

## Puppet Spider Fight

The Puppet Spider has most hands tied behind its back, leaving two free that it can use to slice you. It also has poison to shoot in your direction and a couple of worms that emerge from egg sacs to fight alongside it. Take care of the worms first, so you have fewer enemies to deal with at once and take some Antimiasma Powder to cure yourself of poisoning if it gets too bad.

  * **Venom Claw**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately slows the decay of Might. 

The Puppet Spider's Spirit allows you to take the form of the spider and use its long fangs to slice and dice your enemies. Sadly, this move doesn't inflict any poison damage, but it can still be very handy in battle. The equipped effect is also pretty good, slowing down the decay of Might so you can use your Transformations for longer.
