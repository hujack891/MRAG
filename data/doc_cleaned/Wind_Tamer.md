# Wind Tamer

The Wind Tamer is one of the Vessels you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. These Vessels give you unique, powerful abilities that can significantly affect your gameplay and how you play. 

Simply equipping the Wind Tamer will significantly increase damage reduction during your playthrough, making it a great Vessel to have and arguably one of the best. Activating it during combat or exploration will massively increase your damage reduction for a short duration and grant immunity to strong winds, which is useful against enemies in Yellow Wind Ridge and in a few later game locations.

Vessels are so strong by default that they can completely change how you approach fights, or get you through really tough, tight battles. There are only a few of them in the game, however. Finding Black Myth: Wukong's secrets and killing some of the Black Myth: Wukong secret bosses will lead you to them.
