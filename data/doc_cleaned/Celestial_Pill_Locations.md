# Celestial Pill Locations

**Celestial Pills** are one of the collectibles in Black Myth: Wukong. In this Celestial Pill hub, we will have links that can direct you to a page showing you where to find each and every Celestial Pill the game has to offer. There are three different types of Celestial Pills, each of which serves a different function: 

  * Celestial Jade Lotus Pills upgrade your **maximum Health**.
  * Celestial Nonary Pills upgrade your **maximum Stamina**.
  * Celestial Taiyi Pills upgrade your **maximum Mana**.

These pills can be found in small golden chests scattered about the land in each chapter. They are usually presented as a sort of reward for defeating a challenging foe. Click the links below to see the locations of each type of Celestial Pill so you can have the best stats possible!
