# Webbed Hollow - Middle Hollow Walkthrough

The Webbed Hollow is the second main area of Black Myth: Wukong's Chapter 4, continuing with the middle portion of the large underground cave system. Below you'll find a guide for the second middle area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find an optional encounter against the Elder Amourworm, and how to get past the Centipede Guai and Right Hand of Buddha to reach the Lower Hollow. 

  * **Jump to a Section**
  * **Verdure Bridge**
    * Yaoguai Chief - Elder Amourworm
  * **Middle Hollow**
  * **Bonevault**
    * Yaoguai Chief - Centipede Guai
  * **Cliff of Oblivion**
    * Yaoguai Chief - Buddha's Right Hand

Due to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow. 

## Verdure Bridge

![Wukong MiddleHollow 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6d/Wukong_MiddleHollow_1.jpg)

Now that you've dropped down from the Upper Hollow using one of the two paths to reach the Shrine below, you'll find yourself in the large middle portion of the Hollow. Similar to the Upper Hollow, there's a few diverging paths -- some that lead to optional areas and bosses, and some that reconnect back to the main path down to the Lower Hollow. 

You can look out among the cliffs to spy other large platforms in the distance, but the only way forward for the moment is by going right along a twisting root bridge. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9a/Wukong_MiddleHollow_3.jpg)

A Grasshopper Guai will spring out of a cocoon as you cross, and defeating it will drop the **Locust Antennae Mask** (if you don't get it, you may have to defeat the other Grasshoppers trapped in cocoons back in the Upper Hollow). 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d0/Wukong_MiddleHollow_2.jpg)

Immediately, you'll be presented with a choice: Going to the right of where the enemy was leads on to the Middle Hollow "village", while taking the left path leads to another optional area -- which we'll be taking first. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/87/Wukong_MiddleHollow_4.jpg)

Still, you can briefly explore the right passage to find an upper ledge overlooking the next area with a green Wisp nearby, before heading back. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/95/Wukong_MiddleHollow_5.jpg)

As you cross the small bridge, you can find a small archway on the right, with two talking lanterns that appear to be shouting "big day!" 

As you approach, a mysterious woman (the same one that killed the yaoguai at the start of the chapter) will silence the lanterns, before offering up that there's a supposed treasure beyond the archway. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5b/Wukong_MiddleHollow_6.jpg)

Since she seems like a trustworthy sort, head on inside, and you'll indeed find a literal trove of **Treasure Chests**! 

Looting them all, you'll be able to obtain a Xiang River Goddess Gourd, Enhanced Ginseng Pellet Formula, Gold Ridge Beast, and Purple-Veined Peach Pit Soak, plus several materials like Fine Gold Thread! 

That's not all you can find, as there's an exit beyond leading to an outdoor cliff full of tiny cocoons, where the mother of all worms awaits you. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Elder Amourworm

While not a particularly challenging fight, the Elder Amourworm is a hefty foe that makes up for its lack of abilities with a few dirty tricks you'll need to be ready for, and also be stocked up on Antimiasma Medicine. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/87/Wukong_MiddleHollow_7.jpg)

The Elder Amourworm sports a large creepy mask that you can see when it rears up, and it will use it to shoot out sticky threads in frontal arc. If you get caught, you'll have to mash to get out before being charged and attacked while unable to defend yourself. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2f/Wukong_MiddleHollow_8.jpg)

If the sticky webs weren't bad enough, its other main trick is the ability to shoot out globs of poison, that will stay on the ground for a short duration even if it misses you. The Elder Amourworm can shoot out these poison globs when facing you, but also when you try to attack from its back, making it dangerous no matter which direction you fight from. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/84/Wukong_MiddleHollow_10.jpg)

Even when knocked down, it can behave erratically, wriggling and slamming down to splash out more poison from its sides before getting back up, which can sometimes limit where you can press your attack. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5f/Wukong_MiddleHollow_9.jpg)

Beyond this, most of its attacks will come in the form of simply using its weight to thrash about. You'll usually be able to see it coming when the worm twists around to prepare to swing its body toward you -- but a deflection using Rock Solid can stop the worm in its tracks. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f4/Wukong_MiddleHollow_12.jpg)

It can also perform a surprising leap into the air to crash down on you, which is thankfully slow enough that you'll be able to dodge around to the side when it lands. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/48/Wukong_MiddleHollow_11.jpg)

If you find yourself having trouble avoiding getting poisoned, consider using the Pillar Stance to boost yourself up off the ground. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2f/Wukong_MiddleHollow_13.jpg)

Otherwise, you can also try keeping your distance and strafing during initial poison volleys, and then rush back in so you don't have to dance around poison when getting close. 

When the Amourworm is defeated, you'll gain a **Proto-Amourworm Key Item**. It may seem mysterious, but it does have a use. Bring it to Chen Loong at the Zodiac Village, and then return later to find the tiny Amourworm in a little basket outside his shack.   
You'll need to feed the Proto-Amourworm three Rice Cocoons, which are randomly found by breaking apart small cocoons in the Webbed Hollow.   
Once all three have been given, rest and return to find a Spirit has replaced the little worm, and you'll be able to absorb the **Elder Amourworm Spirit**!

Elder Amourworm

Exit back to where you saw the mysterious women, and look to the right to find a mural with a green Wisp in front of it, and a pathway leading left. Take the path, and you'll find it leads down below the bridge you crossed earlier and over to the group of houses the other path led to. 

## Middle Hollow

![Wukong MiddleHollow 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c6/Wukong_MiddleHollow_14.jpg)

Follow the lower path past a Dragonfly Guai archer, and you'll come to find the path below the bridge is covered in hanging cocoons. 

Mind the Puppet Tick in the middle as you stab the Clawed Cocoons from afar, and create a path through. 

When you reach a fork in the road, you'll find two paths leading to the group of houses. The one on the right leads to the front, but there's also a Dragonfly Guai perched on a high ledge if you didn't kill him earlier that could be annoying. Taking the left path leads up to a back entrance, which may be preferable. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d3/Wukong_MiddleHollow_16.jpg)

Up the left path, you can find a small alcove with a green Wisp, and a Lantern Holder guarding the entrance to the "village". 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bf/Wukong_MiddleHollow_15.jpg)

When you reach the village proper, you'll find a large tree with a collectible vine, but guarding it is another Scorpion Prince. 

This particular foe is imbued with extra spirit power, so he'll be even tougher than the first one you fought in the Upper Hollow. There are also few larger cocoons in this village that hide Puppet Spiders, so try to lure him away from any you may spot to avoid having to deal with extra foes. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/56/Wukong_MiddleHollow_17.jpg)

Dodge his multiple tail strikes and deflect his charging claw attacks to wait for opportunities to counter attack. Defeat him, and you'll gain the Scorpion Prince Spirit (as well as a **Deathstinger Soak**... in case you want to poison yourself on purpose), and can then harvest the **Luojia Fragrant Vine** on the large tree. 

Middle Hollow Luojia Fragrant Vine

From here, you'll again have two diverging paths - one leading up to the left of the large tree in the village area, and a lower path down to the right. Annoyingly, both paths will lead to the same spot where the next boss is, and both routes have a Shrine, plus items worth getting. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/95/Wukong_MiddleHollow_18.jpg)

We'll take the higher path first, due to a bit of overlap that allows us to take out a pesky archer overlooking the lower path, so head up the stairs near the tree where you fought the Scorpion Prince. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5a/Wukong_MiddleHollow_20.jpg)

On the next level, you'll find a Lantern Holder patrolling around a few more shacks and large cocoons with some enemies hiding inside. Be sure to check behind the house on the left to find a green Wisp around the corner. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/74/Wukong_MiddleHollow_19.jpg)

There's also an open shack on the right, where you'll find a small gold **Treasure Chest** box to open that contains the Mirage Pill Recipe, and a few pills for free! 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9d/Wukong_MiddleHollow_21.jpg)

Once you cross a small bridge, you'll find a much larger home with giant cocoons blocking the doorway. Break them apart, and you'll find a large stove-top in the middle with a **Worryfree Brew** placed on it that you can gain as a new Drink for your Gourd. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/20/Wukong_MiddleHollow_23.jpg)

There's also another green Wisp around the back of the house behind more cocoons, but one of the large cocoons behind it hides a Puppet Spider. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/71/Wukong_MiddleHollow_22.jpg)

Outside the house, look ahead to spot a purple glowing altar to the right of the main path. As you approach, the mysterious lady will appear again, unable to grab the talisman placed on the altar. 

She'll warn you to leave things alone, and bid you to find your friend instead. Since we're not much for following orders, go ahead and remove the Talisman from the purple altar, and keep your eyes out for more in this chapter - they'll help us unlock a big secret! 

Moving ahead on this path, you'll cross a large bridge where a Dragonfly Guai archer is posted overlooking the lower path we'll explore next. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/36/Wukong_MiddleHollow_24.jpg)

Beyond the bridge is another next of Amourworms hiding in cocoons, and just past them the passageway opens out into a grassy area. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/77/Wukong_MiddleHollow_25.jpg)

Be wary of one of the mushrooms you can harvest here, as its actually a powerful Fungiman in disguise. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0b/Wukong_MiddleHollow_26.jpg)

As you drop down, be sure to look to the right for a **Meditation Spot** , and over to the left you'll find the Middle Hollow Shrine guarded by an archer and Puppet Spider. 

The Tree, Middle of the Hollow Meditation Spot

![Wukong MiddleHollow 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/65/Wukong_MiddleHollow_33.jpg)

There's a ledge nearby that will lead you straight to the next boss (as well as a few Skeletal Snakes we haven't seen since Chapter 1), but first it's a good idea to check the alternate path. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7f/Wukong_MiddleHollow_27.jpg)

Before you go, check the ledge to the left of the Shrine to find a **Treasure Chest** with some materials in it. 

## Bonevault

Return back to the village area where the Scorpion Prince was, and head down to the bottom to find the pathway where a Grasshopper Guai patrols. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f5/Wukong_MiddleHollow_30.jpg)

As you pass under the bridge, watch for a Puppet Spider to drop from above, and be sure to look along the left wall to notice its actually a row of hanging cocoons. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0f/Wukong_MiddleHollow_31.jpg)

Beat them aside to find a small cave room, where you'll find an empowered Puppet Spider and a few cocoons hiding Amourworms inside. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/64/Wukong_MiddleHollow_32.jpg)

If you're having trouble taking on this supercharged enemy, a good thing to remember is that if it scrambles a bit to side to twirl about, it will either spew poison in a frontal arc, or go for a quick a pincer attack. Defeating this foe will earn you the Puppet Spider Spirit, and you can return back to the path outside. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/64/Wukong_MiddleHollow_29.jpg)

Watch out for some Wasp Guai hiding in the cocoons (which won't be as bad if you dealt with the archer above). As the path opens up, you can spot the other Shrine across the chasm, with this path leading up the left side. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/13/Wukong_MiddleHollow_34.jpg)

Prepare to deal with a group of Stone Spiders, as another archer posted on a high rock will try to make things difficult, but you can sprint over to find a wooden ramp behind him. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a8/Wukong_MiddleHollow_35.jpg)

Up ahead, you'll find another green Wisp along the left wall before reaching the Bonevault Shrine. Wonderful name. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/69/Wukong_MiddleHollow_36.jpg)

Sure enough, both this path and the one by the Middle Hollow Shrine lead up to a large recessed pit with a pile of skulls in the center. Once you've rested up, hop into the ominous pit to face your next big foe. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Centipede Guai

While this fight will be a tougher one than the previous optional bosses you've faced in the Hollow, the Centipede Guai still has some predictable attack patterns that you can soon anticipate and counter and win the day. It's still worth having anti-poison Curios and Antimiasma medicine on hand. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/58/Wukong_MiddleHollow_37.jpg)

After he crashes into the skull pile, the armored bug boss will waste no time lunging through the air at you, and then launch into one of its more common attacks. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9b/Wukong_MiddleHollow_38.jpg)

When attacking from the front, he'll often slam down his head repeatedly to hit you with two times, and then quickly stand up while pivoting around to fall on its back to squash you with its armored hide. Be ready to dodge the third slam, and then immediately begin a combo attack while it struggles to rise up again. 

The Centipede Guai can also perform two slow frontal sweeps with its main claws, alternating a claw on each side, but with its fairly slow swings you can step to the side to focus on its legs. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/25/Wukong_MiddleHollow_42.jpg)

It can also rear back while still crouched on the ground, and extend its head to lunge at you up to two times in a row with reaching claw swipes. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d8/Wukong_MiddleHollow_39.jpg)

However, when you see the Centipede Guai stand up on its two legs, back off your attack immediately. It will start spewing poison down below its body as it staggers around, hoping to catch you unaware. 

Often times when it returns to crawl on the ground, it will take a few moments to pause and groom itself, giving you a huge window to attack, just watch your spacing or use a Pillar Stance to get out of the poison goo on the ground. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/86/Wukong_MiddleHollow_40.jpg)

One if its big main attacks can look scary at first until you understand the movement, and will start when it stands up but begins to crouch its body. The Centipede will roll into a ball and charge at you with alarming speed, and even bounce off walls to come back to hit you a second time. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a8/Wukong_MiddleHollow_41.jpg)

While it does move fast, it's also extremely susceptible to a well-timed Rock Solid Deflection, and when done at the right time, will topple it to the ground. Use this period to unleash your focus points for a big hit, and it will struggle to rise and give you more time to Immobilize it and keep it vulnerable to more damage. 

Be sure to stay on guard when it finally does rise, as it can easily feint into a backward slam with its armored hide. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 45.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0e/Wukong_MiddleHollow_45.jpg)

At lower health, it may also curl into a ball but fly up into the air to slam down while still curled up. Be wary when trying to counter this move, as it will start to squirm around before unraveling into a quick two-hit claw swipe as it reorients itself. 

The one last trick it has up its sleeve will occur after losing half its health. When it starts to emit a large screeching roar, break off your attack and start running in the opposite direction. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/25/Wukong_MiddleHollow_43.jpg)

Dozens of smaller centipedes will roll over the nearby ledge and into the arena to chase you on multiple fronts, and explode on impact. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 44.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a9/Wukong_MiddleHollow_44.jpg)

The best thing you can do is let them chase you by sprinting in the opposite direction, and then swerve to the side to make them all collide with each other and explode. Just be sure not to take too long, or the Centipede Guai will soon join the fray and ram you at much faster speeds. 

Aside from that, there's not too many other moves the Centipede Guai is capable of, so focus on dodging its backward slam, and saving your deflections for when it tries to roll into you, and you'll have no problem finding plenty of time to get your big hits in. 

When the Centipede Guai falls, you'll be able to gain its Centipede Guai Spirit along with a Knot of Voidness and Gold Tree Core. 

Centipede Guai

## Cliff of Oblivion

![Wukong MiddleHollow 47.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b7/Wukong_MiddleHollow_47.jpg)

Look for a tunnel passage on the far side of this arena to find a way forward, and be on the lookout for a few Skeletal Snakes in hiding. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 48.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ae/Wukong_MiddleHollow_48.jpg)

Once you drop down a ledge, you can find a series of ledges along the cliff to the right with a green Wisp at the edge, and can even see an ominous bridge in the distance. 

Head back up the ledges to find an end to the tunnel where a grassy path is filled with cocoons all over the place. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 49.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e1/Wukong_MiddleHollow_49.jpg)

One particularly large cocoon seems to be grunting, but it's not the return of the Venom Daoist. Instead, give it a wack to find your old pal the Horse Guai on the next part of his adventure! 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 50.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/76/Wukong_MiddleHollow_50.jpg)

Once again he'll thank you for your part in helping along his quest, and will hope to cross your path again at the Flaming Mountains, so look forward to that! 

Talk to the Horse Guai some more to learn more of his story, and then head through the rest of the cocoon field, dealing with a few more Amourworms as you go. 

After climbing the path and leaving the cocoon field and Amourworms behind, you'll find another cave-like tunnel with the Cliff of Oblivion Shrine ahead. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 51.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Wukong_MiddleHollow_51.jpg)

Be sure to turn around before you reach the shrine, and you'll find another Purple Talisman Altar, so be sure to collect a second talisman by interacting with it. 

Just past the altar, you can find a small house with a **Treasure Chest** in the front that holds materials like a Blood of the Iron Bull, and two Wasp Guais hiding around the sides. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 52.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/96/Wukong_MiddleHollow_52.jpg)

Rest up at the shrine, and then head into the narrow passage to encounter a very disturbing sight: A very large hand holding a mirror. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Buddha's Right Hand

When you try to interact with the strange mirror, it will disappear as the hand attached to a very long disturbing arm decides to attack you. This fight is a fairly unorthodox one, and you'll need to expect the unexpected as you face this foe in a very narrow hallway with limited room to dodge. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 53.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/41/Wukong_MiddleHollow_53.jpg)

The strange hand has a few different moves it can use both up close and at range you'll need to become familiar with. One of its opening moves will be to slap the wall near you, but that's not all -- the move will cause several rocks to fall from above, and with your limited visibility you'll need to keep dodging around 3-4 large rocks with the last one often being delayed. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 55.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/44/Wukong_MiddleHollow_55.jpg)

If you see the hand curl into a fist before raising up, be ready for it to slam down on the ground nearby and claw into the ground, before scraping along the a length of the arena in a quick dash. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 56.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e6/Wukong_MiddleHollow_56.jpg)

Doing so will often cause the hand to become immobile for a few moments, so be ready to turn around and chase it to follow up some a few attacks. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 57.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0b/Wukong_MiddleHollow_57.jpg)

If it curls into a fist but doesn't raise up, watch for a gold glow to empower the hand as it punches around in a wide arch to try and trap you against the wall with. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 54.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/48/Wukong_MiddleHollow_54.jpg)

At range, it can also charge up a magical dart that can't be deflected with your staff spin. There's a somewhat quick version where it performs a flicking motion, and a longer charged shot where an aura appears behind the hand. 

Thankfully, there's ample opportunities to attack the hand after many of its attacks, but the fun is only just beginning. 

After you get the Buddha's Right Hand to around half of its health it will retreat, and you'll finally meet the owner of the hand. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 58.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/32/Wukong_MiddleHollow_58.jpg)

The terrifying creature will lunge down with a scream, and then begin to spew a literal river of poison into a narrow arena. This stream of bile will damage you continuously, and there are only two real ways to avoid it. 

If you're quick, you can dash under it before it starts spewing poison to get around behind it. If not, quickly get up onto a Pillar Stance to perch above the poison. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 62.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/84/Wukong_MiddleHollow_62.jpg)

Unfortunately, you won't be able to hide up here forever, as the boss will often start to turn its body, and then slam down its hand onto the poison river, but you can slam down first and run for safety. 

Now that its body is now clinging to the walls in front of you, you'll need to aim for its face, and the Pillar or Thrust Stance can help with that. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 59.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/50/Wukong_MiddleHollow_59.jpg)

However, the monster has a few new moves you'll need to worry about, like being able to stab down with its front legs. 

![Wukong MiddleHollow 60.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/74/Wukong_MiddleHollow_60.jpg)

If you notice the monster begin to rise up to where you can't hit it with normal swings, back off and get ready, as it will likely try to punch you with its "right hand" slamming through under its body. The good news is the hand is also another target in addition to its head, giving you more places to swing your staff at.

If the body appears to rise up and lurch backwards out of reach instead of straight up, it means that the boss is preparing to lunge forward with a headbutt, but this can be deflected and countered while its head is lowered for some prime damage output.

The Buddha's Right Hand can also use its hand above to swing its body backward, at which point you'll need to be ready for it to rapidly swing forward and slide through the arena with its talons dragging along. Don't bother trying to deflect it, as you'll just be knocked backward without slowing its momentum.

One of its more annoying new attacks is that it can also retch out a cloud of poison bugs that will fly around in front of its head and deal damage to anything nearby. You may just want to back off instead of pressing the attack during this move to avoid taking unnecessary damage.

Since it won't have too much health left, focus on avoiding its attacks and try to get around its face along the sides to score hits while out of range of many of its attacks, and be ready to dodge falling rocks if it begins shrieking or slamming into walls.

Once you have finally depleted its health, it will try to flee the tunnel and fly away, only to be shot down violently -- forming a bridge with its "hand". Your mysterious lady friend will return to urge you onward before she disappears. 

Buddha's Right Hand

You'll now be able to cross the corpse of the boss to proceed onward, and gain the **Past-Echo** Key Item and actual **Buddha's Right Hand** , which the Shen Monkey can eventually use to craft a new Gourd for you! 

You're now one step further in descending the Webbed Hollow, and the path beyond will lead you down to the **Lower Hollow** where the boss of this region awaits.
