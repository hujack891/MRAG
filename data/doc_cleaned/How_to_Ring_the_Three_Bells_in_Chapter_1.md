If you've been exploring every part of Chapter 1 thoroughly, you’ll likely encounter two of the bells before you’re even told about them. That being said, you might not have rung them. It’s not until the fight with the Whiteclad Noble that you’ll hear a riddle and then be prompted to find the three bells. If you're not sure where to find them all, here's where you need to look: 

## Bell 1

The first bell can be found in the Forest of Wolves. Start from the **Keeper's Shrine at Outside the Forest** and head straight up. 

Go past the two wolves and where the path branches off, then go right toward the bridge and the lone wolf guarding it.

At the bridge, you'll see a large rock on the other side. Go around the rock and to the other side to find a path lined with fires.

Follow the fires toward the entrance to the arena where you'll need to fight Yaoguai Chief Guangzhi is. You'll need to defeat him to gain access to the area and ring the bell. It can be found at the back of the arena.

The second bell can be found in Bamboo Grove. Start from the Snake Trail Keepers Shrine and take the stairs up and go across the bridge. 

Follow this path down and past the river until you loop underneath the bridge you just crossed. Stick to the path until you reach the open area with the bamboo, and look for the path straight up ahead.

Follow the fires again as they curve off slightly to the right, to reach the arena where you'll need to fight Yaoguai Chief Guangmou.

The final bell can be found in the Marsh of the White Mist. After the fight against the Whiteclad Noble, don’t go toward the building that leads to the Black Wind Cave.

Instead, go to the left and through the small cave to find the final bell. It'll be at the end of the path, where a wolf hangs from the nearby tree.
