# Boss List and Guides

Black Myth: Wukong will have you retracing the journey of Sun Wukong, and along the way you'll face an overwhelming amount of deadly Yaoguai Bosses that are as dangerous as they are formidable. This page lists all known Yaoguai Chief and Yaoguai King Bosses found in Black Myth: Wukong, including where to find secret bosses and strategies to defeat them. 

## Boss Types

Bosses generally come in two forms: Yaoguai Chiefs, which are mostly akin to Minibosses, and are found throughout a region, and Yaoguai Kings, which are mostly found at the end of an area or region as a main boss. 

There are more than a few exception to this rule, as certain Yaoguai Chiefs are hidden and can only be summoned by undertaking certain quests or using key items in specific places, and can end up being more powerful than some Yaoguai Kings. 

Each Chapter of Black Myth Wukong also contains one or more secret Yaoguai King Boss Fights - some of which are tied to a "Secret" sub-region that will take you to a new area, and others you must solve puzzles to uncover a secret boss room and fight. 

Finally, there are also certain "friendly" characters you can meet during your adventure who may end up fighting you for various reasons. They are not listed as Yaoguai Chiefs or Kings in your Journal, and aren't "killed" upon defeat.
