# Webbed Hollow - Lower Hollow Walkthrough

The Webbed Hollow is the second main area of Black Myth: Wukong's Chapter 4, concluding with the lower portion of the large underground cave system. Below you'll find a guide for the third and final lower area of The Webbed Hollow, including where to find the secret Yellow Loong and frog boss, and rescue Zhu Bajie from the clutches of the Violet Spider. 

  * **Jump to a Section**
* **Relief of the Fallen Loong**
* **Lower Hollow**
  - Yaoguai Chief - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw
* **Hut of Immortality**
  - Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie

Due to the length, complexity, and number of bosses scattered throughout the Webbed Hollow section of Chapter 4, this particular region walkthrough will be split up into three parts with each section largely covering a major floor level of the hollow. 

## Cliff of Oblivion

![Wukong LowerHollow 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/49/Wukong_LowerHollow_1.jpg)

Now that you've defeated Buddha's Right Hand and created a path with its corpse, the last section of the Webbed Hollow awaits you. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/df/Wukong_LowerHollow_2.jpg)

Before you drop down the ledge after crossing the corpse of the boss, look for a little ledge leading left, leading to a small cliff area with a small golden pot that contains a **Celestial Taiyi Pill** , increasing your maximum mana. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f9/Wukong_LowerHollow_3.jpg)

Now drop down from the body to reach a lower level, where right away you'll be presented with two paths: To the right is a rock bridge lined with a few stone lanterns that leads to the heart of the Lower Hollow, and the main boss. However, there's also a ledge to drop down on the left, which will take you to an optional and lucrative area across a rope bridge, and it helpfully loops back around to drop you back off at this spot. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/72/Wukong_LowerHollow_4.jpg)

We'll take the rope bridge path first (which may look like its a prime ambush spot, but isn't), leading to a long hall with scaffolding surrounding a large stone disc on the right. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f9/Wukong_LowerHollow_5.jpg)

There's a few Skeletal Snakes who might creep up on you here, but more important is to check behind the large stone disc through a darkened path to the right, and you'll find a **Treasure Chest** with random materials at the end of a wooden platform. 

Up ahead, you'll find a second rope bridge, and this one is very much a trap. It's surrounded on all sides by hanging cocoons, and sure enough, many of them are Clawed Cocoons in disguise. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/36/Wukong_LowerHollow_6.jpg)

To make matters worse, there's no invisible walls to stop you from falling to your death when crossing the bridge, which the Clawed Cocoons AND Dragonfly Guai archer at the far end will absolutely use to their advantage to knock you around as you try to cross. While you can use the Thrust Stance to safely poke a few early cocoons, the strategy won't hold very long, and it's almost impossible to target the actual enemies and not the regular cocoons. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/30/Wukong_LowerHollow_7.jpg)

The easiest way to bamboozle the enemies here and get across without falling is with a bit of subterfuge: Cloud Step. Cast it near the start of the rope bridge, and then sprint all the way to the other end, and don't try to staff spin if any arrows come your way, or you're likely to walk off the side by accident. 

## Relief of the Fallen Loong

After sneaking across the bridge (be sure to go back and grab the green Wisp only after you've taken out the archer), you'll find another exit from the Hollow leading to a lush cliffside path. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/42/Wukong_LowerHollow_8.jpg)

The area is chock-full of various plants to harvest, but you'll also find a bunch of Beetle Captains who appear to be doing the same. Since many of them have their backs turned as they scavenge, be sure to sneak up and charge up your focus points to deliver a big heavy attack. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/be/Wukong_LowerHollow_9.jpg)

Off on the right side, there's a larger tree where you can find a **Luojia Fragrant Vine** above a pool of water, and then find a path leading up to the left. 

Climbing up the path, there's more Beetle Captains on the side of the road, before it curves to the left. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/97/Wukong_LowerHollow_10.jpg)

At this point, if you've collected the Loong Scales back in Chapter 2, a familiar voice will begin to speak, indicating that a secret Loong boss is not far away. Follow the voice past a large area littered with the remains of wooden treasure chests to find the local Shrine, and up ahead at the top of the cliffside path you can find what appears to be the Ancient Master standing under a pavilion. 

This man is actually the Yellow Loong, who claims he's been hiding upon the Ancient Master's garb as a pattern. As the last of the secret Loong bosses, he is an incredibly tough battle, especially at this point in the game, so you may want to back off and challenge him when you've got some stronger gear! If you're able to meet the challenge, you'll claim more materials needed to craft the ultimate Loong Staff, as well as a **Golden Carp Curio** , and the **Golden Lining Spell** to transform into the Yellow Loong himself! 

  * See the **Yellow Loong Boss Guide** for details on how to defeat him.

![Wukong LowerHollow 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ac/Wukong_LowerHollow_11.jpg)

Back at the Shrine, head up the trail of old treasure chests to find another entrance back into the Webbed Hollow where a Scorpion Prince is guarding the cave opening. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f7/Wukong_LowerHollow_12.jpg)

Beyond him, you'll find yourself on one of the large platforms along the Middle Hollow we couldn't reach earlier, so be sure to check the far left path to find the other side of a broken bridge with a green Wisp to absorb. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/ff/Wukong_LowerHollow_15.jpg)

Take the far right path past a few pools of water, and you'll be able to head along the right wall past a Grasshopper Guai to find three Puppet Ticks, who will try to slow you down with webbing and summon Stone Spiders. Defeat them all, you you'll gain the Puppet Tick Spirit from the enemy in the middle of the group. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b1/Wukong_LowerHollow_13.jpg)

Return back the way you came and look for a high ledge at the top of this platform. To the right, you'll find a **Treasure Chest** guarded by a lone archer, which holds rare items like a Septenary Heartfire Pill, Knot of Voidness, or Blood of the Iron Bull! 

![Wukong LowerHollow 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/74/Wukong_LowerHollow_14.jpg)

Head back to the left along the edge of the platform, and you'll find the third **Purple Talisman Altar** , which you can pluck the talisman from (the last altar we won't find until we reach the next major area). 

![Wukong LowerHollow 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/30/Wukong_LowerHollow_16.jpg)

Rather helpfully, there's a brazier by a ledge nearby, and looking down you can find a spot to drop back down to the two bridges we noted at the start of the Lower Hollow, putting you quickly back on track to the main pathway. 

## Lower Hollow

![Wukong LowerHollow 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/11/Wukong_LowerHollow_17.jpg)

Heading along this path, there will only be a lone Dragonfly Guai to stop you, and behind him is a ledge leading down a large sloping path to the bottom of the Hollow. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/55/Wukong_LowerHollow_18.jpg)

Once you reach the bottom, you'll find a passageway to a wooden ledge overlooking a home set around a large purple-flowering tree. You're just in time to see the Second Sister return with a very docile Zhu Bajie, completely under a spell thanks to the Sage's Relic. It seems he's all set to be married to the mother of spiders, which doesn't really sound good. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b1/Wukong_LowerHollow_19.jpg)

Once the scene concludes, you'll find a new pathway to the left of the balcony. Be sure to grab a green Wisp hovering on a high ledge before dropping down into an underground tunnel. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2d/Wukong_LowerHollow_20.jpg)

Watch out for Stone Spiders that line this webbed tunnel, and cautiously move ahead until you reach a larger "hatchery" type room. 

Here, you'll find a large fissure in the ground full of cocoons, and a dozen Wasp Guai lurking all around the edge of this fissure. There's only one sloping path into the narrow pit, and it's full of Amourworms in cocoons, which means falling in from above can get very deadly, very quick. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2d/Wukong_LowerHollow_21.jpg)

Instead, you'll want to carefully approach the rim of the fissure from sides, keeping to the back of the Wasps and using charged attacks to defeat them one by one, without alerting too many, and keeping well away from the fissure itself. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e6/Wukong_LowerHollow_22.jpg)

Only once you have made sure all the Wasp Guai are gone from the edges should you hop into the pit itself, and take out the Amourworms to reach the very far side, where your reward will be in the form of a **Treasure Chest** that should hold a Gold Tree Core and other materials. 

Exit the hole and look for an exit on the far side of the hatchery room. Fight your way past a few Stone Spiders and down another passage lined with cocoons and a few Puppet Ticks. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b9/Wukong_LowerHollow_23.jpg)

As a Dragonfly Guai begins to rain arrows down you from a ledge above, check the right side of this passage for a small opening the in the wall, and give the archer the slip. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/64/Wukong_LowerHollow_25.jpg)

On the other side, you'll find a path upward, and you can head right to find a **Meditation Point** for this part of the Hollow, and a smaller opening on the left to ambush the archer on his walkway. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c6/Wukong_LowerHollow_24.jpg)

Past the archer, you'll find a high alternate route that sidesteps the area below lined with Clawed Cocoons, and a ledge you can drop down with a green Wisp on it to reach the Lower Hollow Shrine. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c6/Wukong_LowerHollow_26.jpg)

Be sure to climb back up the ledges (use a jumping heavy attack to gain height), and continue to follow this path to a flooded cave where this chapter's Frog Boss awaits. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw

The fourth Frog Guai boss in as many chapters, Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw is a poison-infused boss, much the way the previous frog enemies have used lightning or ice in their respective arenas. However, you'll soon find that poison isn't the only new thing that this particular boss brings to the table. Still, having Antimiasma Pills can be essential to your survival, due to the ability for you to resist repeat poisoning when consuming them. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1d/Wukong_LowerHollow_27.jpg)

By now you should be more than familiar with these frogs' basic attacks - the leaps, the swipes and backhands, the belly thrust, and the backward kicks. They'll likely deal a lot of damage on their own, which makes his unique attacks all the more terrifying. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/53/Wukong_LowerHollow_28.jpg)

After taking a bit of damage, Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw will rear back and spew out poison while looking above. This will cause a literal poison rain to cascade down, covering a huge portion of the arena in toxicity that will build your poison meter at an alarming rate. It is sometimes possible to Pillar Stance out of the poison, but the frog's repeated attacks will likely knock you down anyway. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9d/Wukong_LowerHollow_29.jpg)

This leaves two options: Retreat and continue the fight in a severely reduced space, or pop an Antimiasma Pill and brute force ahead while your immunity lasts. Given that the frog can also do a regular spew of poison in a wide arc that creates more hazardous spots on the ground, it's often better to just rely on the pills rather than restricting your movement even more. 

If you thought that was the extent of his moves, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. Perhaps you've been wondering ever since defeating Buddha's Right Hand where the other hand went? Turns out, it's inside Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw! 

![Wukong LowerHollow 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/31/Wukong_LowerHollow_35.jpg)

When he gets to around half his health or so, the boss will start using tongue attacks on you, only the tongue is actually a very long hand with its own unique and bizarre attacks! 

![Wukong LowerHollow 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/92/Wukong_LowerHollow_32.jpg)

What used to be a standard straight tongue attack will now also retract while he fires to projectiles as the hand flicks its fingers to fire magic darts in quick succession, meaning even if you dodge the tongue-hand shooting out, you need to dodge when it retracts as well. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1b/Wukong_LowerHollow_31.jpg)

He can also wave the tongue-hand around in a haphazard fashion, making it weave in a large arc from side to side as it swipes at you three times, before rising high up to slam down at you (but you can use Rock Solid to send him tumbling back in surprise). 

![Wukong LowerHollow 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/21/Wukong_LowerHollow_33.jpg)

The most devious attack of all doesn't even start with his tongue. If you've studied his regular attacks, his hand slaps almost always start with his right hand (to your left) when not performing a large leap. However, if you see him quickly raise his left hand while hopping close (to your right) dodge immediately, or you'll be grabbed. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6a/Wukong_LowerHollow_34.jpg)

This will cause his tongue-hand to shoot out and carry you upwards, fill you with poison immediately, and then slam you down! It's more than likely this will eliminate almost all your health, leaving the poison to finish the job if you aren't quick with an antimiasma pill (or took one earlier). 

![Wukong LowerHollow 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/25/Wukong_LowerHollow_30.jpg)

It may take a bit to learn and anticipate all of his surprises, and you can try using the Thrust Stance to get some distance away from his close-range moves. Make the most of your deflections or Immobilize to press your attack and augment it with Spirits and Transformations to keep the boss staggered so that you can finish him off. 

When Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw is defeated, you'll gain another Tadpole to upgrade your frog Spirit, as well as the Left Hand of Buddha! This means you can now use both hands to craft and purchase a special Immortal Blessing Gourd when you visit the Shen Monkey in the Zodiac Village! 

![Wukong LowerHollow 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a6/Wukong_LowerHollow_37.jpg)

You can look for an exit to the boss arena on the far side, which leads to a ledge with a green Wisp, and a drop back down to the main path from the Shrine. 

Behind, you'll find the area littered with more Stone Spiders leading back to the Shrine, while ahead a lone Beetle Captain guards a small archway. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/26/Wukong_LowerHollow_38.jpg)

Past this foe, you'll enter another long dark tunnel, and you can find a Puppet Spider hanging up on the right above a green Wisp to absorb, and a patrolling Lantern Holder further down the tunnel. 

## Hut of Immortality

As you exit the tunnel passage, you'll find another Shrine close by. This is a good time to stock up on items, medicine, and upgrade gear or craft as needed, because the fights are only getting harder from here on out. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c3/Wukong_LowerHollow_39.jpg)

Once you're ready, head through the gate to join the party, and it seems your just in time to meet the not-so-lucky groom. 

## Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie

Your old friend Zhu Bajie is not exactly himself, and now that he's been bewitched, you'll have to beat some sense into him. This is no easy task, as the scrappy little pig once journeyed with Wukong himself. This makes him a wily fighter, if a bit unorthodox. 

Zhu Bajie prefers to attack with his special 9-pointed rake, and while it may look silly, it's absolutely dangerous. He can swing it in wide arcs in a few different ways, but he usually has a slow wind-up at first that you can dodge away from. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e0/Wukong_LowerHollow_40.jpg)

When his rake glows red, he'll charge up his rake attacks with explosive force. These will usually send you reeling back if you try to deflect them (or at the very least not stagger the boss), and if they hit the swings cleave into the ground, they'll cause waves of force to explode outward from his swings. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 44.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e6/Wukong_LowerHollow_44.jpg)

He can also perform a tricky move to counter where he jumps into the air, and pauses for a moment before slamming down with his rake. He'll immediately slide past you, pivoting to slam down again when you think you've evaded the attack. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 45.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b4/Wukong_LowerHollow_45.jpg)

He can also steal a trick from Guangzhi and use his rake like a pogo stick, slamming down with it before hopping up and spin into another downward slash attack. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8a/Wukong_LowerHollow_42.jpg)

When he starts spinning his rake in a low, wide arc, he can continue to spin until turning into a literal tornado. It can be hard to dodge at first, but once you do he'll have a hard time course-correcting, and you can follow his path until he spins himself dizzy. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c2/Wukong_LowerHollow_43.jpg)

Quickly move in to make use of his stunned state, but you should probably try and attack from the sides, as he can sometimes react to the spinning by throwing up all over you... which isn't great. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 46.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/82/Wukong_LowerHollow_46.jpg)

Thanks to his clumsiness, and that he's prone to stumbling back and falling when staggered by big hits, you'll have a lot of opportunities to unleash your charged up hits and Spirit Attacks on him, but you'll still want to be ready to go on the defensive any time you see him flare up with energy. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 47.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/04/Wukong_LowerHollow_47.jpg)

Once you've dealt enough damage to clear his health bar, Zhu Bajie will flee the Hut of Immortality. The battle isn't exactly over, but you will get some experience and will for surviving the encounter. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 48.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f5/Wukong_LowerHollow_48.jpg)

There actually isn't anything more you can do in the Hut of Immortality, as all the doors are sealed. However, when you return to the Shrine outside, you'll find a new cave path has been carved out that leads outside to a large muddy hole. 

Your battle with Zhu Bajie isn't over. In fact -- it's about to get a whole lot harder. 

## Boss Fight - Zhu Bajie (Second Encounter)

For this encounter, the pig clearly has the home field advantage, and he'll remind you every step of the way with a wide variety of painful moves that are extremely hard to dodge. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 51.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/47/Wukong_LowerHollow_51.jpg)

This is because fighting in the mud will drastically slow any dodge roll you try to make to get out of the way of his attacks. You can alleviate this somewhat with the help of one of the Sages Relic's passive buffs, or a particular gourd soak, but they won't put you back on even footing. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 50.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f1/Wukong_LowerHollow_50.jpg)

This means you'll have to be even more precise in your dodging, and using spells like Immobilize, Rock Solid, or Cloud Step to avoid attacks you can't roll away from in time. 

The most important thing to note is that the mud hinders your ability to dodge, but it does **not** slow your ability to sprint. This means there are several situations and attacks where it can be preferable to run instead of waiting for a last second evade, so try to remember that option during this fight. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 52.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/02/Wukong_LowerHollow_52.jpg)

If there's any good news, its that for the first half of the fight, he'll continue to use most of the same moves as he did in the Hut of Immortality. Though you will have to be more precise in your dodging, you'll at least have an idea of what to expect. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 53.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8a/Wukong_LowerHollow_53.jpg)

A few moves will be altered slightly, as instead of tearing up the ground with his rake, he can send muddy projectiles your way instead, which seem to have a more more narrow arc to compensate for your diminished evasion. 

He can also still spin into a tornado (which you should try to sprint away from rather than dodge), and getting hit by it can send you flying. However, he won't get dizzy this time around, so prepare for him to quickly move into his next move rather than standing around for awhile. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 54.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9e/Wukong_LowerHollow_54.jpg)

One new move (and herald of things to come) will often appear after one of his jumping slash attacks. Once he hits the ground, he'll use his own transformation attack to turn into a giant muddy carp, which will quickly roll forward to try and flatten you, but you can dodge under it with some timing. 

Fight carefully, and take note of which of his rake attacks swing fast, vs the ones that take time to swing around to dodge at the right times, or have a focus point in reserve to use a Thrust Stance varied combo and get out of his attack range. 

Once you take off half his health bar, things will get real messy fast. Zhu Bajie will go back to his roots, in a sense, and transform into a giant boar that just can't wait to roll around in the mud with you. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 55.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ef/Wukong_LowerHollow_55.jpg)

In this form, he'll start by performing a series of charge attacks after stamping the ground to cause muddy geysers to erupt all around. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 56.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/85/Wukong_LowerHollow_56.jpg)

When he begins to charge, you can still sprint out of the way, but you'll need to act fast. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 57.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9b/Wukong_LowerHollow_57.jpg)

Spot dodging can also work here, and if you try to perform a Rock Solid Deflect, you'll be knocked backward, but he'll often stumble to the ground as well, letting you get up and get some hits in before he regains his footing. 

Boar Bajie has a lot of wide swinging attacks to be wary of, often shifting his body weight to slam his head to the side or swing it upwards. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 62.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/86/Wukong_LowerHollow_62.jpg)

He can also dive at you in a diving tackle that can be very damaging if it lands, and you'll need to dodge as he lands, but be ready for him to rise up and turn to hit you with his hind legs in a mule kick attack. 

After taking a bit of damage, Boar Bajie will eventually let out a huge roar, starting a very long and terrifying phase. He'll begin to transform into different beasts, which have their own attacks you'll need to adapt to. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 58.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/85/Wukong_LowerHollow_58.jpg)

He'll start by transforming into a giant carp fish, which will wiggle a bit before leaping high into the air. Immediately get onto your Pillar Stance before he slams down on the ground, as it will release a shockwave across the mud that's hard to dodge given the conditions of the arena. You'll only have a moment to land your Pillar Stance smash, but after that you should only be focused on evasion (you won't be able to Immobilize his transformations). 

![Wukong LowerHollow 59.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/76/Wukong_LowerHollow_59.jpg)

In his carp form, he'll swim about for a moment to try ramming you, and will then back off before swimming forward to dive at you, going under the mud as he does. It'll be hard to anticipate when he surfaces, so be ready to evade at a moment's notice. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 60.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/01/Wukong_LowerHollow_60.jpg)

Once he's out of the mud and on the surface, he'll transform again, this time into a large rhino, and begin to charge at you. If this wasn't bad enough, he'll summon two copies to charge just behind him on either side, making dodging extremely risky. 

The only good news is that the copies don't seem to alter their path once they start the charge, but Zhu Bajie will, so you'll need to be careful about timing your dodges and not rolling into a path of a copy. Rock Solid will only move you backward, and won't be too much help if it traps you in front of him. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 61.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/33/Wukong_LowerHollow_61.jpg)

Once he charges for a third time, he'll lose the clones, and then transform back into a fish for a moment. Wait for him to dive through the air past you, and he'll then rocket toward you as a giant glob of mud. 

Dodge or deflect if you can't move fast enough, and be ready for his boar form to reappear dazed and winded from the phase. This is your big opportunity to hit him with all the focus points you've stored up, as well as any powerful Spirit Attacks you can unleash. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 63.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/73/Wukong_LowerHollow_63.jpg)

One last thing to remember is that while you may have problems dodging, the same isn't always true for your Transformation Spells. In a pinch, they can be used to give you a level of evasion your can't achieve on your own, so long as you don't act too reckless and waste your might. 

This will be a tough fight to survive, and may take more than a few tries to understand how to survive his biggest attacks. At the very least, this phase only lasts for one half of his health bar. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 64.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/13/Wukong_LowerHollow_64.jpg)

Once you manage to burn down the rest of his health, you'll finally be able to free Zhu Bajie from the bewitching effect of the needle that was stabbed into his head, thanks to the mirror you found on the Right Hand of Buddha. 

Unfortunately, the spiders aren't done with him, and he'll be whisked away, leaving you with his **Blood-Stained Needle** and the **Jade Moon Rabbit Curio**. 

## The Purifying Spring

![Wukong LowerHollow 65.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d5/Wukong_LowerHollow_65.jpg)

With the boss battle over, you can find a cave entrance on the far side of the muddy arena, leading to The Purifying Spring Shrine, with a **Treasure Chest** full of materials off to the right. You'll also gain access to a new Non-Pure Armor Set to craft by having defeated Zhu Bajie, which boasts some great defense and poison resistance. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 66.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e2/Wukong_LowerHollow_66.jpg)

Exit the cave and grab a green Wisp as you do, and you'll find yourself at the bottom of a large gorge with a spring in the middle, and a winding path up the cliff walls to the top. There's another green Wisp overlooking the pool of water, and scattered Skeletal Snakes all about. 

Head to the far side of the spring where you can find a Lantern Holder patrolling by some cocoons, and a path beyond him leads up to a high ledge guarded by a Dragonfly Guai. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 68.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/83/Wukong_LowerHollow_68.jpg)

However, if you look to the left up the sloping path, there's another wooden platform leading to a small alcove by the edge of the water, where the small rat you've been seeing in almost every chapter is sitting atop another statue head. Once he flees, inspect it to find your fourth Skandha: The **Skandha of Choice**. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 69.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4f/Wukong_LowerHollow_69.jpg)

At the top of the ledge, watch for a Grasshopeer Guai ambush as you leave a small tunnel, and then confront the archer, who has been empowered by a Spirit. Even with more health, he's still no match when you close the distance, and you'll be able to claim the **Dragonfly Guai Spirit**. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 70.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/25/Wukong_LowerHollow_70.jpg)

Moving along the main path, you'll find it guarded by one last Scorpion Prince, so be ready for his charging attacks and quick leaping tail strikes as you bait out opening to counter him. There's a few extra Skeletal Snakes in the vicinity, so beware they don't try and all gang up on you at once! 

## The Gathering Cave

![Wukong LowerHollow 71.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c8/Wukong_LowerHollow_71.jpg)

You can check the left wall for a green Wisp and a hiding Fungiman among some mushrooms, and then continue on to find a switchback path heading up to a plateau above. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 72.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/34/Wukong_LowerHollow_72.jpg)

Here you'll find one last Shrine for the Webbed Hollow, meaning the final boss of this particular area is fast approaching. As with other bosses in this realm, poison can be a big factor in the fight, so it's worth crafting extra Antimiasma Pills, and equipping poison resistant gear, curios, and Gourd soaks to help out where possible. 

When you're ready to face the mother of spiders, head through into the large cave opening to face the Lady of the Webbed Hollow. You'll learn more about her tragic life during the adventures of Wukong as she speaks with Zhu Bajie, and once you interrupt the scene, you'll need to prepare for battle. 

## Yaoguai Queen Boss Fight - Violet Spider

Much like The Second Sister, this boss will take the form of a gigantic and fearsome spider, and uses attacks in a few similar ways. She can lash out with her appendages, which will subtly shift into long blades but also give you a clue as to where her main attacks will come from. As you might expect, you'll also have to deal with dodging both poison and webbing, making mobility key to your survival. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 73.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ee/Wukong_LowerHollow_73.jpg)

The Violet Spider will often begin the fight with a signature webbing attack, shooting out several strands in a large frontal arc that you'll need to dodge or you'll waste time getting stuck and having to free yourself while being unable to do much else. Even if you do dodge the initial blast, there will be a web coating on the ground where the attack land that will slow you considerably, and you'll want to move the fight away from such spots as much as possible. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 79.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0d/Wukong_LowerHollow_79.jpg)

She'll often follow up her webbing with a poison attack, sending out a similar salvo of five poison projectiles that will seek you out rather quickly. The good news is you'll be able to use your staff spin to repel these heat-seeking gobs of poison, rather than having to dodge at the last moment. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 74.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e1/Wukong_LowerHollow_74.jpg)

The Violet Spider shares more than just the look of The Second Sister -- she also uses a few of the same moves with her talon-like appendages. This includes the feint of raising up her front leg to the side before performing alternating downward stabs, followed by a large leaping slam. 

The bad news is even if you've gotten familiar with these attacks, she often follows them by spewing poison right onto the ground in front of her, which will limit your ability to retaliate. Be sure to dodge to the side first before starting your attack to get out of the way of most of her poison. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 75.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d9/Wukong_LowerHollow_75.jpg)

The same goes for their shared moveset of leaping forward to stab straight ahead with two talons, as she'll quickly follow the stab with a concentrated poison spray right in front of her, which you can avoid by dodging to the sides rather than rolling forward or backward. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 76.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/13/Wukong_LowerHollow_76.jpg)

When she goes into a frenzy of stamping down all of her legs quickly, she'll do so while spewing out poison in several directions. Try to stay one step ahead of her by keeping to her right side, and watch for her final talon stab at her front to your right, sending out another plume of poison, but leaving the rest of that area exposed to a counter attack. 

She also has a nasty habit of rapidly twitching her body while standing still, only to suddenly pivot and slam her rear into you at full force, which can deal a ton of damage. Even if you're at range, expect webbing strands to fly out that you need to dodge or deflect with your staff spin. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 77.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/27/Wukong_LowerHollow_77.jpg)

One of her more insidious moves is another play on her webbing attack, where she'll laugh as she sends out strands from her back to slowly arc across the air and seek you out. She'll send these webbing strands out one after the other to try and both slow you down and also deal damage, ending with a huge wave of 12 projectiles in a large arc that all fly to you at once. If you're stuck trying to get out of her earlier webbing, you'll be a sitting duck, making evading the last salvo even harder. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 80.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2e/Wukong_LowerHollow_80.jpg)

Luckily, these strands all count as projectiles that can be deflected, meaning you need only stand your ground and spin your staff to knock each webbing projectile away as it comes, letting you evade both getting stuck and taking damage all at once. 

Rather annoyingly, while most attacks can be deflected with Rock Solid easily, they'll cause her to retreat backward by a good amount, and out of range or regular retaliations. It's better that you build up your Focus Points before trying to deflect her attack, and then immediately follow with a high powered heavy strike with your thrust or pillar stance to catch her as she retreats. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 84.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a3/Wukong_LowerHollow_84.jpg)

Similarly, you'll also need to be careful if you want to employ your Immobilizing spell, as you don't watch to catch her with her body too high in the air to hit. Try instead to catch her right after an attack where she ducks low to strike at you, and make the most of that time or after staggering her when she falls down. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 78.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9f/Wukong_LowerHollow_78.jpg)

Once she reaches about half of her health or less, you'll need to keep your eyes peeled for when she dives her head into the ground. This will leave only her rear abdomen sticking out of the ground, but resist the urge to smack at it. Zhu Bajie may try to warn you, but it may not come out in time that she's preparing a deadly poison explosion! 

![Wukong LowerHollow 81.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cb/Wukong_LowerHollow_81.jpg)

The poison blast has an extremely wide area of effect, and can be difficult to escape if you're still very close to her when she burrows in. Luckily, as long as you have a lot of stamina saved up, you can also negate the blast by using the Pillar Stance. It will likely take 50% of your stamina bar to soak, but you'll be free of any damage or poison! 

![Wukong LowerHollow 82.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c3/Wukong_LowerHollow_82.jpg)

At this point, her eyes will start to glow, signifying her second phase. Things will get very scary if her eyes start to glow even brighter and mesmerize you. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 83.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a0/Wukong_LowerHollow_83.jpg)

If this happens, you'll suddenly be transported to an illusory realm where you're on a bed of webs instead of solid ground. This can get extremely bad as the more you move around, the more you'll be slowed until eventually you'll be exposed as you try and break free of the webbing. 

Expect the Violet Spider to absolutely take advantage of your vulnerability in these moments, attacking with both her talons and a large jump slam attack that even staggers her for a bit. You'll need to stand your ground and use Rock Solid to knock away her blasts if you're unable to dodge them in time. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 85.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Wukong_LowerHollow_85.jpg)

The good news is this phase doesn't last forever, but you will need to survive it for about 30 seconds, so you should also consider utilizing Immobilize to trap her in place, or even a Transformation Spell to offload the damage onto a different form. 

Her eyes will stop glowing after you've been mesmerized once, so once the room is back to normal, continue to dodge her projectiles and get your hits in after her violent stabs and slam attacks. 

When the queen of spiders finally falls to your assault, she'll beat a hasty retreat to return to wherever she's hidden the Sage's Relic. You'll need to follow quickly, because a literal spider army will appear to give chase! 

![Wukong LowerHollow 86.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/80/Wukong_LowerHollow_86.jpg)

Quickly run toward the cave entrance on the far side, and don't stop sprinting for anything. 

![Wukong LowerHollow 87.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c0/Wukong_LowerHollow_87.jpg)

When you reach the other side of the cave tunnel, you can spot a large sloping mountain path toward a big tree. Even though you may see spiders appearing ahead of you, keep running straight regardless and they'll dip to the side. 

Eventually, the road will crumble, but you'll be saved by that one mysterious spider sister who seems to be on your side. This will take you high above the Webbed Hollow, and onto the mountain trail toward the **Temple of Yellow Flowers**.
