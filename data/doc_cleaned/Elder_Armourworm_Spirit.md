## Elder Armourworm Location

The Elder Armourworm can be found in a small clearing overlooking the forest outside the Webbed Hollow. To get there from the Verdure Bridge Keeper's Shrine, take the path on the left of the Shrine (if you're facing it). Stick to the left and pass through a wooden gate to find a room full of chests. Loot them and continue through the opening on the opposite wall to find a small clearing overlooking the Webbed Hollow. Drop down to find the Elder Armourworm.

## Elder Armourworm Fight

The Elder Armourworm relies mostly on its large, fat body during the fight. Expect to dodge lots of belly flops and huge swipes with the upper portion of its body. Thankfully, the Elder Armourworm is quite slow, so you should be able to dodge most attacks without too much trouble. 

## How to Get the Elder Armourworm Spirit

The Elder Armourworm Spirit is the most unique one of all and has its own mini-side quest to complete before you can collect it. The first step to collecting the Elder Armourworm Spirit is to unlock the Zodiac Village. Fight the lightning dragon in the lake on the left side of the North Shore of the Bitter Lake to begin the quest. He will then ask you to visit the Xu Dog for medicine. Collect the medicine and bring it back to Chen Loong to complete the quest and unlock Zodiac Village.

Once unlocked, Zodiac Village is where you can find all of the 'shop' NCPs, like the Xu Dog, Shen Monkey, and a new blacksmith character named Yin Tiger. Chen Loong will also reside there. 

Speak to Chen Loong and hand over an item called the Proto Armourworm. The Proto Armourworm will turn up in a small basket just above the seed baskets outside Chen Loong's hut. You need to feed the Proto Armourworm three Rice Cocoons to make it grow into a Spirit that you can absorb the next time you visit the village. 

You can get Rice Cocoons from egg sacks throughout the Webbed Hollow!

  * **Foul Spray**
  * Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Critical Hit Chance when in Poisoned state. 

The Elder Armourworm's Spirit allows you to take the form of the great worm and flail about the arena, spraying poison everywhere. These poisonous pools deal Poison Bane to any enemies who make contact with them. They don't do any damage to you, though, so you don't have to worry about watching your step after the move is complete. If you do become poisoned for any other reason, however, the Elder Armourworm's equipped effect increases your Critical Hit Chance until the effect has worn off.
