# Fireproof Mantle

The Fireproof Mantle is one of the Vessels you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. These Vessels give you powerful, active abilities that completely change combat for a brief moment, enhancing your power, defense, and more. 

The Fireproof Mantle has two effects. Having it equipped significantly increases Burn resistance, and grants immunity to Scorch damage from lava-covered terrain in the game. While, activating the Vessel in combat will, for a short duration after activation, grants Burn immunity and gradually increases Focus. There are specific lava-filled environments where this will be extremely effective.

Vessels come as they are, and as they are extremely strong already you should be more than able to feel the effect of the powerful abilities during fights and bosses. There are only a handful of them in the game, however, so you will need to seek them out by finding Black Myth: Wukong's many secrets and killing some of the Black Myth: Wukong secret bosses.
