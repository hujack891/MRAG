## Rat Archer Location

The Rat Archer is somewhat tricky to find and doesn't spawn until you defeat the Earth Wolf Spirit in Sandgate Village. From the Sandgate Village Keeper's Shrine, run over the bridge to find several enemies, a few of which are perched on top of an inaccessible roof. You cannot reach them at this point, so head right and work your way around Sandgate Village. 

You will eventually find yourself in the Earth Wolf's arena. Take down the wolf and open the door to continue onward. As soon as you open the door, the Rat Archer and his minions will jump down and ambush you.

## Rat Archer Fight

The Rat Archer isn't a boss and fights like any other Rat Archer, so you will be familiar with his move set by the time you encounter him. Choose your times to attack wisely and don't forget to make use of Staff Spin to deflect any incoming projectiles. That is the best way to avoid attacks from any archer.

  * **Mighty Release**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately reduces the Stamina cost for Staff Spin.

The Rat Archer's Spirit Power allows you to take the form of the Rat and shoot a volley of flaming arrows at your foes, dealing a decent amount of damage. Having the Rat Archer equipped as your Spirit also reduces the Stamina cost of Staff Spin, which is an incredibly handy move, especially in places where there are a lot of archers present.
