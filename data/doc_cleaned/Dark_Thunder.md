# Dark Thunder

Dark Thunder is one of the Transformation Spells you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. It is one of the later game Transformations, found within the Flaming Mountains. 

With the Dark Thunder Transformation, you are able to turn into a horse guai and be immune to Thunder Damage, inflicting Thunder Bane on the enemy with each attack. Any Focus built up before transformation can be converted for use afterward. Dark Thunder's moveset is: 

  * **Light Attack: Lightning Lashes - Successively lash the enemy ahead, building up Focus**. This is a slow, weak light attack that is mostly used for building up Focus instead of dealing damage.
  * **Heavy Attack: Thunderbolt Sweep - Successively lash the enemies around, building up Focus**. This is a stronger attack, focused on dealing damage and building up Focus at the same time. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Dark Thunder Location

The Dark Thunder Spell can be found after visiting the Horse Guai at every location he appears at in the game: 

  * Black Wind Mountain \- Bamboo Grove - Back Hills (inside a cave)
  * Yellow Wind Ridge \- Sandgate Village - Village Entrance (tied to a post by the Earth Wolf boss)
  * The New West \- New Thunderclap Temple - Temple Entrance (on the walkway in the back left of the temple grounds)
  * The Webbed Hollow \- Webbed Hollow - Middle Hollow (in a cocoon in the area behind the Centipede Guai)
  * Flaming Mountains \- Furnace Valley - Valley Entrance (found after killing Keeper of Flaming Mountains)

Upon finding the Horse Guai for this final time, you can pull the chain in the mouth of the elemental cart next to them to obtain the Spell. 

### Horse Guai Black Wind Mountain Location

From the start of the Bamboo Grove area, hug the left wall to find the cave with the Horse Guai.

### Horse Guai Yellow Wind Ridge Location

When at Sandgate Village in Yellow Wind Ridge, loop around to the left and kill the Earth Wolf boss. Just behind it, you can find the Horse Guai tied to the post at the statue.

### Horse Guai The New West Location

As you progress through the temple, you will eventually meet two mages with a large door behind them. Before heading ahead, take the path along the balcony on the left, to a walkway with a large statue. The Horse Guai is standing by one of these pillars on the walkway.

### Horse Guai The Webbed Hollow Location

After you kill the Centipede Guai, you can continue through a path behind it through some caves. Along this path, as the cave opens up again, you can find a coccoon. Destroy it to reveal the Horse Guai.

### Horse Guai Flaming Mountains Location

The Horse Guai can be found at the Furnace Valley, Valley Entrance area of the Flaming Mountains. However, you will need to kill the Keeper of Flaming Mountains boss towards the end of the chapter before you can do anything here. 

Once the boss is dead, you can then visit the Horse Guai and pull the chain on the cart next to him to obtain the spell.
