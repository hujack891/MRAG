# Brown-Iron Cart

Brown-Iron Cart is a Yaoguai Chief boss fight that you'll go up against at the start of Chapter 5 in Black Myth: Wukong. Blocking the pathway from the Ashen Pass to the Camp of Seasons, the cart is just one of the Five Element Carts you'll need to fight in this Chapter. 

## How to Find the Brown-Iron Cart

After defeating the Pale-Axe Stalwart, go up the stairs and begin your ascent of the mountain. At the top of these steps, the health bar for the Brown-Iron Cart will appear and you can find it blocking the path to the left. However, there's also a broken set of stairs to the immediate right, which you can climb up. This will bring you to a small roof you can run along to collect a green Wisp.

Dash up the broken steps and run along the small path to get behind the cart. Drop down and you'll also be at the next Keeper's Shrine.

The Brown-Iron Cart doesn't have much variation in attacks. If you approach it head-on, you'll want to use the Fireproof Mantle to help with its continuous fire attacks. But, you can also avoid these by sticking close to its arms. You'll just need to watch out for when it rears slightly up and slams its fists down. Thankfully, this attack can be dodged. 

If you've taken the small path to get behind it as we suggested, and got to the Keeper's Shrine, you have the advantage. The cart can't turn around considering it's on such a small path, so you can ignore the fist-slamming attacks entirely and focus just on when it blows out fire all around it. Use the Fireproof Mantle and watch out for when it blows fire. As soon as it dies down, drop down and hit it relentlessly with combos. When it starts to get ready to unleash the fire, jump back up the little ledge to completely avoid it.
