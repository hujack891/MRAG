## Beetle Captain Location

The Beetle Captain can be found guarding a single chest in a small clearing in the Webbed Hollow. To get there, reach the Upper Hollow Keeper's Shrine and run up the stairs right next to it. Turn right and start making your way down the path into the caves beyond. It will take a decent amount of time to get there, but if you stick to the right, you will reach the Beetle Captain eventually.

## Beetle Captain Fight

The Beetle Captain fights like all others of its kind. It is armed with two swords that it uses to slash and stab at you. The Beetle Captain also has large, white wings on its back that allow it to fly up into the air and slash you as it crashes back down to the ground. It can also fly up and charge you, stabbing in quick succession with both swords.

The Beetle Captain Spirit allows you to take the form of the Beetle and soar up into the air before flying towards your foe and slashing at it with your swords. This move can deal a decent amount of damage and allows you to potentially evade attacks while you fly upward. Having the Beetle Captain equipped boosts your Stamina as well, allowing you to sprint farther, jump more, and land more combos.
