## Where To Use Blood of the Iron Bull in Black Myth: Wukong

Blood of the Iron Bull materials can be used at the Shrines to upgrade your Spirits. Higher upgrades for them require more Blood of the Iron Bull materials, so it is important to find as many as you can. 

If you are keen to know which Spirits you should level up, be sure to check out our guide on the best Spirits to use in the game, and for all their locations, visit our page on the Spirit Locations. 

## Blood of the Iron Bull Locations

Below, you can find a guide to each Blood of the Iron Bull location within the early-game, the majority of which are in chests or found from defeating bosses. 

### Blood of the Iron Bull Location 1

Whenever you stumble upon a blue, glowing enemy and defeat them, you will get a Blood of the Iron Bull. These enemies will also drop their Spirit for you to claim, so be sure to seek them out in our Spirit Locations guide.

### Blood of the Iron Bull Location 2

The first Blood of the Iron Bull proper can be found by defeating the Wandering Wight in the Forest of Wolves \- Outside The Wolves location in Black Wind Mountain. From the Shrine, head to the right through the open forest, and you will find the Wight. 

You need to defeat this boss before you defeat the optional boss in the Chapter 1 Secret Area by ringing three large bells. Once you challenge the boss of the Ancient Guanyin Temple, the Wandering Wight will disappear, and you will no longer be able to challenge him and gain his rewards! 

This technically counts as one of the Blood of the Iron Bull's you get from the blue glowing enemies, as you get the Wandering Wight Spirit here. But, it is worth mentioning on its own.

### Blood of the Iron Bull Location 3

The next material location can be found by defeating Guangmou along the main path in the Bamboo Grove \- Snake Trail location in Black Wind Mountain. 

This is a main boss, so you can't miss this particular Blood of the Iron Bull.

### Blood of the Iron Bull Location 4

The next Blood of the Iron Bull material can be found after the Black Wind Cave \- Outside The Cave Shrine in Black Wind Mountain. It is located on the bamboo bridge, just after the Shrine itself. You will find it in a chest on the path, just heading off from the bridge, if you jump over the barriers of the bridge. 

You can also find a Spirit here, which will give you another Blood of the Iron Bull.

### Blood of the Iron Bull Location 5

The next Blood of the Iron Bull is in Chapter 2, Yellow Wind Ridge. From the first Shrine: Village Entrance \- Sandgate Village, head around to the edge of the cliff on the right (away from the archers on the gate's roof). After two tough mini-boss enemies, you will see a large hill in front of you. Head up it.

At the very top, on your left, there will be a chest with the Blood of the Iron Bull inside.

### Blood of the Iron Bull Location 6

You can also get another Blood of the Iron Bull in the area by defeating the Earth Wolf boss in the courtyard opposite the chest for the previous material. It is to the left of where you fought the two mini-bosses on the ascent up the hill. This Yellow Wind Ridge boss will drop his Spirit too.

### Blood of the Iron Bull Location 7

Additionally, just onwards from this fight, as you progress on the main story path, you will come across the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince at the Sandgate Village \- Valley of Despair Shrine in Yellow Wind Ridge. This is a mandatory boss, so you can't miss them. 

Upon defeating them, you will get another Blood of the Iron Bull, as they will drop a Spirit for you to collect.

### Blood of the Iron Bull Location 8

The next Blood of the Iron Bull can be found at the Crouching Tiger Temple \- Temple Entrance Shrine in Yellow Wind Ridge. Head up the stairs, and once you are about halfway up, turn to your right, and you will see a chest. Inside this chest is the material.

### Blood of the Iron Bull Location 9

The next material is in a chest on the right from the Fright Cliff \- Rockrest Flat Shrine in Yellow Wind Ridge. Directly on your right from the Shrine, you can find an enemy up the stairs here as well as a chest. The chest has the Blood of the Iron Bull.

### Blood of the Iron Bull Location 10

A little further on, after you defeat the Stone Vanguard  <meta /> in Yellow Wind Ridge, you will slide down a slope from the Fright Cliff \- Rock Clash Platform Shrine. Halfway down the slope is a statue on the left and a chest with the Blood of the Iron Bull. 

The easiest way to get this is to jump and shimmy your way on the slope right at the beginning, towards the left side of it.

That way you can jump on the cliff-face and down towards the statue and chest.

### Blood of the Iron Bull Location 11

At the base of the sand slope in Fright Cliff, you will see the Yellow Sand Formation \- Windseal Gate Shrine in Yellow Wind Ridge. Instead of going through the gate with the Sterness of Stone and Keeness of Tiger, head up the path opposite the slope. 

Here you will find the Gore-Eye Daoist boss, which you can defeat. They will drop the Blood of the Iron Bull and a Spirit for you.

### Blood of the Iron Bull Location 13

After defeating the Tiger's Acolyte in Yellow Sand Formation \- Windrest Hamlet, you will get the Old Rattle-Drum. You will need to complete this questline to then take on the Mad Tiger. Defeating the Mad-Tiger will give you another Blood of the Iron Bull. 

A full breakdown of this quest can be found here.

From Chapter 3 onwards, the Blood of the Iron Bull becomes far more common, and you can find several in each sub-area. Simply kill as many enemies and bosses, and keep an eye out for chests as you explore.
