# Rat Sage Staff

The Rat Sage Staff Staff is an Epic weapon in Black Myth: Wukong. It comes with solid stats, damage, and a decent, albeit easily outbeaten unique effect compared to the other Weapons in the game. 

The weapon comes with a respectable 66 damage, and the unique effect of making the fourth move of a light attack combo and the mobile staff spin stir up a whirlwind of sands, increasing attack range and damage.
