# Gray-Bronze Cart

Gray-Bronze Cart is a Yaoguai Chief boss fight that you'll go up against at the start of Chapter 5 in Black Myth: Wukong. Blocking the pathway to the Ashen Pass II, the cart is just one of the Five Element Carts you'll need to fight in this Chapter.

After the fight with Father of Stones, go through the door and follow the path. You'll come to a cave, which you'll need to pass through to go to the lower level of the valley.

As you come outside of the cave, you'll need to go left and up a narrow path. At the other end of it, the next element cart blocks your progress.

## Gray-Bronze Cart Boss Fight and Guide

Head straight up the narrow path, and when you're close to the cart, look to the left to find an alcove you can dip into to avoid the fire attacks that also has a green Wisp in it.

You can expect the same moveset from each of the carts, so again, the Fireproof Mantle Vessel works wonders here. For this one, though, you won't be able to get close to the feet and stay there without being hit with the fire attacks. So, stick close during the fist slam (without the fire) and dodge this. But when it rears up, jump back into the alcove to protect yourself from any fire attacks.
