# Cosmo Radiance

Cosmo Radiance is one of the unique materials in Black Myth: Wukong. It is used for weapon and armor crafting to craft unique gear unlocked upon defeating a boss. 

The Cosmo Radiance can be used to craft the Spikeshaft Staff from the Shrine. 

To obtain the Cosmo Radiance, you need to defeat Yellowbrow in New Thunderclap Temple in The New West. This is the final boss of the chapter.
