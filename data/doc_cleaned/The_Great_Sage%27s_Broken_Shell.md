# The Great Sage's Broken Shell

The Great Sage's Broken Shell is one of the main and final bosses you'll fight in Chapter 6 of Black Myth: Wukong. You'll jump into this fight as soon as you finish against The Stone Monkey, and it's the final one needed to see the ending of the game. 

## How to Find The Great Sage's Broken Shell

You'll start this fight as soon as you finish the one against The Stone Monkey. 

## The Great Sage's Broken Shell Boss Fight and Guide

For this fight, you can expect two phases as well. You'll essentially be going up against a better version of yourself, with access to fully unlocked skills and stances that are also available to you. 

He'll use variations of **Vengeful Mirage, which leaves an exploding illusion behind, Rock Solid, Ring of Fire, and Pluck of Many**. On top of this, he'll use Smash, Pillar, and Thrust Stance attacks.

We'd recommend having Ring of Fire equipped, so you can match him, and upgrade it as much as possible. Strangely enough, if you step into his Ring of Fire, you can also use it to build your Focus. 

However, you may prefer to use Spell Binder (if you've unlocked it) and increase your Attack and Critical Hit Chance. We'd also suggest using Plantain Fan again in this phase. You should also use Medicines like the Loong Aura Amplification Pellets, Ginseng Pellets, and Enhanced Tiger Subduing Pellets to buff your Focus gain and attack. 

### The Great Sage's Broken Shell Phase One

The Great Sage's Broken Shell will start this phase by dodging your attacks each time you try to complete combos. As these are perfect dodges, you'll see multiple illusions left behind in its wake, which will explode after a few seconds. To counter this, you'll want to land a few hits, and then jump back to avoid the explosions, but continue to follow up and complete the combos for a heavy attack.

We'd suggest throwing out the Plantain Fan as soon as the fight starts, to knock him back, and allow you to whittle his health down quickly before he even gets a chance to start. In terms of Transformations and Spirits, we found that Ebon Flow was useful for deflecting his attacks and quickly building might to perform a powerful finisher, and the Wandering Wight Spirit was able to take down a chunk of his health in one go. 

You'll see the Great Sage's Broken Shell's version of a heavy attack, as the staff glows gold and he jumps up with his staff to smash it down on you. These moves can also be evaded, to help build up your own focus for a counterattack. Again, you'll want to take advantage of Wukong's arm and staff in this fight, by using the fourth focus point for heavy attacks, and making use of the increased Critical Hit Chance. 

When the Great Sage uses his variation of Pluck of Many, you'll see a duplicate appear as close as possible to you and will swing its staff. This will disappear after attacking, so you won't have to face multiple duplicates all at once.

As mentioned, the Great Sage will use multiple stances, and you'll occasionally see him climb his staff to perform Pillar Stance. This is not to evade your attacks but is just a way to slam down on you from above. As you see the staff start to bend toward you, get ready to dash away. 

Finally, be mindful of where you stand in this fight. If you're too far from him, he'll throw out his staff as a spinning projectile, or swap to Thrust Stance to attack you. It's best to stick close to him but jump back when he performs perfect dodges or throws out Pluck of Many. 

Just like the Stone Monkey, once you've got his health bar down all the way, phase two will begin. 

### The Great Sage's Broken Shell Phase Two

At the start of this phase, the Great Sage will remove your relics from you, so you'll lose the buffs you selected when unlocking them. This is when you'll want to rely more on your Medicines, Curios, and Spells, especially Ring of Fire to build up your focus quickly. It can be much harder to hit him during this phase, so you'll need to play it somewhat safe to build up your focus. 

You also need to be careful when using your Gourd at this stage. When you do, it's best to dodge to be safe but try to limit your use of it. This is because the Great Sage can Immobilize you and steal your Gourd for himself.

In this phase, you'll generally see the same attacks as the first phase, but there will of course be additional variations or they will be heightened. One of these changes includes the Great Sage's Broken Shell climbing to the top of his staff just like before, but this time, unleashing a flurry of projectiles. Tap dodge and roll to the side quickly to avoid this and build up focus while doing so. Then be prepared for him to slide down toward you, skim the water, and quickly dash back at you to try for another hit. 

His combos will also become more aggressive and dangerous, and you'll see him jump up in the air and spin his staff multiple times. It will glow red as he smashes it down, and you'll need to dash out of the way to avoid it doing huge amounts of damage.

Lastly, you'll see him use the Somersault Cloud spell to zoom around the area, hit you, and dash off. He will try to grab you when using this, so it's important to learn the timings and roll away as often as possible. 

Just like the first phase, the key to this fight is attacking when you have your Focus Points built up and not trying to finish light combos. He'll typically interrupt them or use his perfect dodge to hurt you in the process, so it's best to wait until you can land those heavy attacks. It's also important to note him during his Rock Solid phase! Otherwise, you'll see the Destined One kicked around by the Great Sage's duplicates. 

![Water Curtain Cave Walkthrough \(37\).png](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/37/Water_Curtain_Cave_Walkthrough_%2837%29.png)

Using Gingseng Pellets and Ring of Fire will get your Focus up in no time, and Smash Stance is generally favorable here, to land those heavy slamming attacks. Don't forget to throw out the Plantain Fan as soon as it's ready each time, as well, as this is one of the best ways to attack him undisturbed. 

Once the fight is over, The Great Sage's Broken Shell will be vanquished, and a cutscene will begin. The Great Sage will stumble in the water and the relics will leave his body as golden orbs. 

Each one will land inside the Destined One as the Great Sage crumbles, and his crown lands in the water. As the Old Monkey appears again, he'll place the crown upon the Destined One's head and finish the tale of Sun Wukong.
