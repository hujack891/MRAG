# Valley of Ecstasy Walkthrough

The Valley of Ecstasy is the fourth main region of Chapter 3 in The New West in Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide for the Valley of Ecstasy Region, including how to reach the valley itself by defeating Non-White, and exploring the different parts of the valley to uncover several Yaoguai Chiefs on the path to the New Thunderclap Temple, and completing the Treasure Hunter's Quest and the Pagoda Realm Prisoner's Quest by defeating the final Captain.

After you solved the monk's riddle by praying at four Buddha Statues in the Precept Corridor, you'll split up from Zhu Bajie and make your way into the belly button of a large Buddha statue along the cliffs, taking you up a narrow pathway and into the Mindfulness Cliff. 

## Mindfulness Cliff

![Wukong MindCliff 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9f/Wukong_MindCliff_1.jpg)

From the Shrine, you'll find yourself at the edge of a large pit with a pathway spiraling around its edge. 

However, as you begin to head up the path around the pit, you'll be interrupted by the arrival of a jester-like figure who wants to wear your face. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-White

![Wukong MindCliff 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/00/Wukong_MindCliff_2.jpg)

Non-White is a peculiar foe who attacks in haphazard fashion with his large thin blade. The most important thing to note is the smaller bar above his health bar: Non-White can use his blade to repeatedly block and parry your attacks, which can at times effectively give him a second health bar. Finding the right times to strike can be useful in circumventing his defenses, but you'll want to be wary of his frost and poison attacks. Stock up on both Antimiasma and Body-Warming medicine to deal with both scenarios should they arise. 

![Wukong MindCliff 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/38/Wukong_MindCliff_3.jpg)

Expect Non-White to close the distance on you rapidly, as his most common move starts with him crouching before rolling toward you, and then sliding his blade up into a jump attack for a second strike, followed by a short pause before performing a very wide swing with his frost-enchanted blade. 

![Wukong MindCliff 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e3/Wukong_MindCliff_7.jpg)

With a bit of practice you'll be able to get the rhythm down for evading this attack, but that's only half the problem. Non-White will follow this attack by slowly moving his weapon in front of him, during which time he'll be able to easily block any retaliating attack you might have. If you want to get past his defenses, try Immobilizing him first and then hitting him from the back where he can't defend himself. 

![Wukong MindCliff 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b0/Wukong_MindCliff_4.jpg)

Another of his dangerous combo moves will start with a quick shout and an upward thrust of his blade followed by a quick jab. He'll then adopt a strange pose by lifting a leg up, only to dash at you with extreme speed for a final two-hit strike that can be dodged or deflected to get him off-balance. 

![Wukong MindCliff 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fe/Wukong_MindCliff_6.jpg)

If you spot him twirl his blade up behind him, be ready for a quick dash forward as he slashes upward, and then slams down to create a trail of ice in front of him. Thankfully, unlike some of the other moves, this will lead him wide open if you dodge to his side and strike back. 

![Wukong MindCliff 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/ce/Wukong_MindCliff_5.jpg)

Finally, he can also simply hang back and toss two poison-coated daggers your way in a quick throw, requiring good reaction time to evade. 

Note that if you try to press your attack while he's in an idle or defensive posture, he'll eventually deflect your combo with a louder block noise, and then retaliate -- but you can beat him at his own game by deflecting after his deflection. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/71/Wukong_Mindcliff_8.jpg)

If you've got a good idea of his attack patterns, using the Smash Stance's varied combo to "see through" his attacks can be extremely useful to power through his slices to hit him while he's unable to defend, and the follow-up heavystrike you can unlock usually can't be blocked by him either. 

The good news is once you've taken out half of his real health bar (not his sword's defense bar), he'll break off the attack and retreat. The bad news is you haven't seen the last of him. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b6/Wukong_Mindcliff_9.jpg)

Before giving chase, there's a very important secret he's trying to lead you away from! Head out onto the ledge past where you fought him, and you'll find a green Wisp to absorb. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/11/Wukong_Mindcliff_10.jpg)

It might not look like it, but you can actually fall down a ledge below this spot, and you can then spy a trail of ledges leading down to a fallen pillar with another green Wisp along the middle, meaning you can actually cross it! 

![Wukong Mindcliff 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/36/Wukong_Mindcliff_11.jpg)

Once you cross the giant pit by way of the fallen pillar, take out the Monk Supporter on the other side, and work your way up the path. Another Monk Supporter can be found on the higher path leading out of a cave and back outside, but beware of a Cyan Bat lurking above. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4a/Wukong_Mindcliff_12.jpg)

Take a right at the end and keep following the narrow path to find a third Monk Supporter and Golden Lotus Guai in front of another cave entrance. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/dc/Wukong_Mindcliff_13.jpg)

It's here you'll find one last Monk Supporter guarding a **Treasure Chest** , but this is no ordinary chest, as it contains the **Fiery Gourd**! Though it cannot be upgraded, drinking from it will help keep any chill effects at bay, and also increase your maximum Stamina. As an added bonus, and it can also hold two different Soaks! 

![Wukong Mindcliff 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/13/Wukong_Mindcliff_14.jpg)

As you leave the tunnel, you'll spot a peculiar yet familiar site -- that same old rat who was spotted in the Forest of Wolves is lurking around here too, and quickly darts away. 

Check where he was lingering, and you'll find a small statue head holding the **Skandha of Thought** \- the third Skandha in as many chapters! This ledge should also put you right above where you fought Non-White, so grab a nearby green Wisp before hopping down and chasing after him. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3a/Wukong_Mindcliff_16.jpg)

There are more Monk Supporters in a darkened room at the top of the stairway, and try to take them on one at a time if you can. More can be found in the next room, alongside a few Frozen Corpse Censor Holders who will try to blast freezing wind at you, or create vortexes along the ground you'll need to stay away from. 

Take out the pair and Monk Supporter praying to a large statue altar, and you'll find a small gold box you can open that contains **Maitreya's Orb** , a peculiar and fairly risky curio to equip. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/17/Wukong_Mindcliff_17.jpg)

Continue taking the path back outside and up the cliffs to reach a large open area with an archway at the far end leading to a huge valley, and on the right you'll find Non-White at a Meditation Spot waiting for round two. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-White (Round Two)

In addition to the previously discussed moves Non-White utilized in your last encounter, he'll get even more aggressive with sneaky frost attacks, making using the Fiery Gourd a very smart investment to keep from getting chilled, or you can use the Ring of Fire to get some breathing room and recover. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d7/Wukong_Mindcliff_18.jpg)

Non-White will charge his blade by lunging at you with a quick back-handed slice, before dragging his blade along the ground to slash upward and send out a row of icy spikes in a straight line. 

![Wukong MindCliff 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/66/Wukong_MindCliff_19.jpg)

He'll now also swap his stance to pivot and look back at you over his shoulder, before leaping over with a quick slash and then jumping up to hang in the air a moment as his blade charges before making an extremely fast dash across the room with his frost sword. 

Since you'll need to fully defeat him this round, it's more than likely that you'll end up smashing through the defense from his weapon and removing the bar entirely. Unfortunately, this isn't necessarily a good thing. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c9/Wukong_Mindcliff_20.jpg)

Non-White will quickly perform his own type of Cloud Step to evade you and retreat, replacing his longer frozen sword with two smaller poison blades, and will have a whole new attack set during this temporary phase. While it does mean he can no longer block you until his frost blade regenerates, you'll need to be wary of taking too much poison damage. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0a/Wukong_Mindcliff_21.jpg)

Among his new attacks, he can quickly launch into two slashes, and then crouch down and pivot to charge in a final dashing strike meant to chase you down if you try and dodge away -- but you can deflect this final move to stop him in his tracks. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/20/Wukong_Mindcliff_22.jpg)

If you don't deflect, be ready for him to turn around after the charge and launch a barrage of poison daggers in your direction that are much harder to get out of the way of if you aren't ready to start strafing. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ea/Wukong_Mindcliff_23.jpg)

Another dangerous attack that can be hard to follow will start with him moving erratically in his mist form to close the distance to you, and start with a spinning slash attack. As the momentum carries him in a circle, he'll return to face you by spewing poison in your face. Since it's a ranged attack you won't be able to deflect this one, but you can dodge to the side while sprays straight ahead. 

When he crouches down while crossing his blades, he'll leap over for a low jump attack with both daggers, followed by two delayed swings of his poisoned weapons, and ending with a quick uppercut attack. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/16/Wukong_Mindcliff_24.jpg)

One last move he can perform quickly when at a distance is using his vanishing act to slide along the ground and then feint up in the air to the side of you before slashing down at an angle. He'll do this twice in a row to keep your guessing at his movements, ending with a slam attack that will break the ground around him even if he misses you. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/71/Wukong_Mindcliff_25.jpg)

With so many feinting attacks and vanishing, it can be hard to get a bead on him, and unfortunately, he tends to escape from Immobilization almost instantly, so you'll need to save that for when his frozen sword regenerates, and instead focus on deflecting his wild strikes to stop him in his tracks. Since many of his attacks are low to the ground, it's not a bad idea to swap to the Pillar Stance during this phase to attack him from above, rather than continuing to rely on the Smash Stance to see through his attacks if he'll just feint away. 

There's a good chance he'll revert back to his original weapon before the fight is done, so make sure to adapt your tactics accordingly, and use a Transformation Spell like Red Tides to keep up with his movements. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0b/Wukong_Mindcliff_26.jpg)

When Non-White finally falls, you'll be able to claim the Non-White Spirit from him, and also make use of the **Meditation Spot** nearby to claim a free Skill Point. 

**Warning** \- Before you proceed, make sure you've defeated the Apramana Bat along the North Shore of the Bitter Lake, and also encountered the Treasure Hunter man before you proceed into the next area!

![Wukong Mindcliff 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4a/Wukong_Mindcliff_27.jpg)

Beyond this arena, you can head through an archway to see the giant titular Valley of Ecstasy below you. It's a one-way slide, and the region is about to get a whole lot bigger and confusing. 

## Forest of Felicity

![Wukong Felicity 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/78/Wukong_Felicity_1.jpg)

As you slide into the Valley of Ecstasy proper and watch the familiar Apramana Bat fly past you (provided you fought him at the Bitter Lake), you may notice you're entering a sizeable region. Luckily there's a Shrine near your landing spot, but it can be easy to get turned around and lost in this expansive valley, so we'll break it down for you: 

![Wukong Felicity 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b1/Wukong_Felicity_2.jpg)

  * You'll start in the **Forest of Felicity** , which with your back to the slope, comprises much of the area directly in front of you that includes a winding main path through this region, and also a hidden canyon to the left.
  * A large sloping hill to the right of the Shrine leads down to the **Brook of Bliss** , where a sizable and traversable river cuts through this part of the valley, leading to a cliff with a secret cave underneath.
  * Ahead of the forest is a second lower valley to the left as the main path cuts right, leading to the **Towers of Karma** area and a large forested field.
  * Following the main path as it crosses a high road between the brook and towers leads beyond a giant guarded archway to **Longevity Road** , which has its own optional forests and fields on both sides as the central path leads on to New Thunderclap Temple.

Of course, you're free to explore as much (or as little) of these sub-regions of the valley as you'd like, but with the amount of questlines and yaoguai chiefs to find in each spot, we'll be covering each of them. 

### The Snow Fox's Quest

![Wukong Felicity 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5c/Wukong_Felicity_3.jpg)  
Not far from the Forest Shrine, look for a small arch along the main path, and you'll find a unique corpse sitting along the wood posts that looks different from the rest. You can interact to hear a voice -- coming not from the body, but from the fox pelt around its neck. Apparently that story about the snow fox and the human you saw after completing Chapter 2 actually happened, and the fox guai wants revenge.   
She'll gift you the Snow Fox Brush, allowing you to take the form of the Snow Fox and seek out the human scholar who resides in New Thunderclap Temple.   
However, it's a long road to get there, and you can't attack in this form, so for now it's better that you De-transform, and use the key item later on when you're close to your target. 

![Wukong Felicity 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8e/Wukong_Felicity_4.jpg)

Back at the Forest Shrine, look left from the main road to find two different passageways into a canyon. The passage before reaching the Shrine leads past a green Wisp you can absorb into a small pond where a new Frog Guai miniboss is waiting. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang

Like the two Frog Guai before him, Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang is a formidable foe with surprising reach, and if you thought you'd seen everything a frog boss could do, you're sadly in for a surprise. Much as Chapter 2's frog boss was imbued with lightning attacks, so too does this boss have the power of ice on his side, and unless you take precautions, you'll be frozen solid and out of stamina -- unable to move while you're torn to pieces. 

Having body warming medicine for this fight is a must, and it's highly recommended you equip the Frostspout Twig Curio, Fiery Gourd, and Circle of Fire Spell to offset his many frost-filled attacks. 

![Wukong Felicity 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/32/Wukong_Felicity_6.jpg)

While you've likely seen what a Frog boss can do with their extremely quick belly thrusts, rear kick attacks, and jump slashes, there's a lot of new tricks up this yaoguai chief's sleeve. Many of his moves, including his arm swipes that end with a slam, will now create a field of frost upon the frozen lake. 

![Wukong Felicity 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d4/Wukong_Felicity_9.jpg)

His tongue-lashing attack has now been altered to be even more deadly: It will create fields of frost on the ground as it swings back and forth -- and also lob rocks at you each time his tongue whips back, forcing you to stay mobile out of the frost and dodging the boulders at the same time. 

![Wukong Felicity 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d1/Wukong_Felicity_5.jpg)

He can also take a deep breath and bellow chilled air straight at you, which can make it tough to get out of his range unless you lock him down with Immobilize or Cloud Step away. 

Any time his icy attacks create a frost field, you'll need to evacuate quickly from the affected area, or you'll rapidly become chilled and eventually immobile while your stamina is sapped. 

Remember to take control of the battlefield, and dictate where the fighting happens by luring him away from any lingering frost field that tend to stay longer than you'd expect. He'll always end up coming to you, so back up and be ready to retaliate when he lunges forth. 

![Wukong Felicity 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0c/Wukong_Felicity_7.jpg)

Certain times, Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang will also let out a loud screech, causing ice shards to form at various points around the arena. Stay mobile and away a good distance away, but not too far. 

After his screech, he'll crouch down and perform another bellow that sends a shockwave out, exploding all the crystals to deal additional frost damage to you. Since it's a bit harder to evade, you can get in a bit closer and prop yourself up on the Pillar Stance to evade the attack, then send your staff smashing down on him after the explosion. 

![Wukong Felicity 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/34/Wukong_Felicity_8.jpg)

While he doesn't have a ton of health or as much defense as other bosses, he can still get even more dangerous when low on health. His standard arm attack combo can be supercharged, causing icy explosions in a line from each of his swipes, and causing his slam to build up a giant frost area below him while also boxing you in a ring of icy crystals. 

Surviving this can be very tough as he'll try to keep you trapped and locked in his icy lair until you can't move, and then follow up with a loud screech to explode the icy and rocks around him, or perform another follow-up attack. 

![Wukong Felicity 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/86/Wukong_Felicity_10.jpg)

As with his other big attack, your Pillar Stance can help keep you away from the blast, but you can also try creating a Ring of Fire to give yourself "holy ground" of sorts to stay safe in from the otherwise chilly prison. 

Defeat this third frog menace, and you'll gain another Tadpole and other materials to upgrade your Spirits and gear. 

![Wukong Felicity 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/05/Wukong_Felicity_11.jpg)

You can head up the canyon past where the frog miniboss was to find some plants to harvest and a path leading into a large forested field where the Towers of Karma are, but first we'll head back to the main road. 

![Wukong Felicity 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/83/Wukong_Felicity_13.jpg)

As you head up to explore the main path, look for a small road leading up a slope to the left as the main road curves right (just past one of the tunnels leading into the canyon). This will take you high up on the rocky cliffs that separate the shrine from the canyon you were just in, and you can backtrack across this ridgeline path where some Frozen Corpses and a Golden Lotus Guai are lying in wait. 

![Wukong Felicity 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fe/Wukong_Felicity_14.jpg)

At the end of this path along the ridge, climb up to find a **Treasure Chest** guarded by a Falcon Fan-Maker. Once he's defeated, help yourself to the Blood of the Iron Bull and other materials, and look for a green Wisp to absorb on the right. 

![Wukong Felicity 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1d/Wukong_Felicity_12.jpg)

Since the main path down below leads on to the Longevity Road, we'll instead head to the right side of the Forest Shrine where a hilltop is teeming with a few praying Frozen Corpses and various plants to harvest. There are two paths here -- one before the shrine, and one after the archway where the Fox Guai spoke to you, and both lead down to the next sub-region. 

## Brook of Bliss

![Wukong Brook 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c5/Wukong_Brook_1.jpg)

There are two easy paths to take down to the Brook of Bliss: one right next to the Forest Shrine, and one a bit further up along the main path. Both paths are lined with various Frozen Corpses and likely a Cyan Bat or two hiding up in the trees. 

![Wukong Brook 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ee/Wukong_Brook_2.jpg)

Taking the path by the Shrine, you'll head down the slope and take a right to find the start of the river, which has a green Wisp to absorb and plants to harvest. Leave the other side of the ravine for the moment, and take the closer path on the side of a ravine nearest to where you came down. 

![Wukong Brook 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/df/Wukong_Brook_3.jpg)

On this side, you'll find a few fallen trees creating makeshift bridges above the brook below, and one of them has another green Wisp to absorb along the tree, while the other has a green Wisp on top of a giant rock. 

![Wukong Brook 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/65/Wukong_Brook_4.jpg)

Take this path all the way down until you find an actual stone bridge, where a Thunder Rhino Master guards the way forward. Though he can cast a variety of lightning spells like the Rat Governors of Yellow Wind Ridge, they don't have a lot of health and aren't too much of a threat. 

![Wukong Brook 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a9/Wukong_Brook_5.jpg)

Be sure to cross the bridge to find the Brook of Bliss Shrine, and you can circle back to the top of the brook to find another Thunder Rhino Master patrolling near a Cyan Bat. 

Before you check up the hill from the Shrine, head back across the bridge and follow the path down to the brook itself. 

![Wukong Brook 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/88/Wukong_Brook_7.jpg)

Here you'll find the lower part of the brook, where a Crow Diviner waits in a large pool of water by some falls. Unlike the earlier Crow Diviners, this one is not only empowered with a Spirit, but has even more deadly moves. 

In addition to their quick dashing sword swings, Crow Diviners in the valley like this one can also blast out an icy chill your way while becoming nearly invisible aside from a purple glowing eye. 

![Wukong Brook 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/48/Wukong_Brook_8.jpg)

In this cloud step-like form, you'll only be able to see their purple eye flash before they lunge at you and deal incredible damage -- even causing purple explosions or icy blasts around their slash -- so be ready with a deflect or cloud step of your own. 

Defeating this particular foe will allow you to absorb the Crow Diviner Spirit (and another green Wisp nearby), but he won't be the only one you'll face in this area. 

![Wukong Brook 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e8/Wukong_Brook_6.jpg)

Be sure to follow the path of the brook to harvest more plants and deal with Frozen Corpses and Golden Lotus Guai along the way. 

![Wukong Brook 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c0/Wukong_Brook_9.jpg)

Once you reach an apparent cliff edge, beware of a Frozen Corpse hiding in an overturned bell, and check the inside to find a green Wisp to absorb. 

![Wukong Brook 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ac/Wukong_Brook_11.jpg)

In fact, this cliff edge hides a secret, and you can carefully descend to find a secret cave that's devoid of opponents for now, but you can at least activate the Melon Field Shrine for now. 

![Wukong Brook 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e9/Wukong_Brook_10.jpg)

Head back up along the brook and climb up to the middle part of the river. Here you can head upsteam and harvest a variety of materials as you do, just beware of some Croaky enemies hiding in the waters. 

![Wukong Brook 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b6/Wukong_Brook_12.jpg)

Once you've harvested all the plants along the river, return up to the Brook Shrine, and head up the hill taking the road to the left. 

![Wukong Brook 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a2/Wukong_Brook_13.jpg)

At the top, you'll find lots of Frozen Corpses to smash apart, as well as a Thunder Rhino Master and two Frozen Corpses guarding a **Treasure Chest** at the foot of a giant stone pillar that overlooks the path you took to get up here. 

![Wukong Brook 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cb/Wukong_Brook_14.jpg)

Just past the crowd of Frozen Corpses, you'll find the most important thing in this region: A lone man bound and kneeling in front of a large stone pagoda on the hill above. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-Able

Don't mistake his subdued appearance for weakness, Non-Able is probably one of the toughest Yaoguai Chief bosses you'll face in Chapter 3. Unlike other enemies, he won't use any magic or ranged tricks on you, and trades it all in for overwhelming power and a mastery of martial arts that makes him an extremely challenging foe -- and that's before the restraints come off. 

If you haven't made use of them in other fights, now is definitely the time to take advantage of all the medicinal pills and consumable buffs you can craft and use. Items like the Tiger Subduing Pellets to raise your attack and others that can raise your stamina or focus can all help out greatly, and you'll want every advantage on your side. 

![Wukong Brook 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/56/Wukong_Brook_15.jpg)

Though he begins with his hands tied, Non-Able is an expert fighter who can utilize some deadly kicks and deal immense damage and can strike with little warning. Any time you see him angle his head down to your right, be ready for a roundhouse kick to spring out fast. 

![Wukong Brook 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/21/Wukong_Brook_16.jpg)

He'll often follow this very fast kick with a jump kick, but delay it in the air before striking to lure you into dodging early, and then follow up once he lands with a spin on the ground for extra damage at close range. 

![Wukong Brook 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/05/Wukong_Brook_17.jpg)

If he instead crouches down slightly but keeps his head angled forward, he can lash out with another very quick side kick, followed by anywhere from 1-3 extra spinning roundhouse kicks as he uses their momentum to keep up with your evasions. 

He can also easily chain this into a high leap as he somersaults into a slam onto the ground requiring another fast dodge. 

Any of these attacks can be chained together with rolling kicks that come in a few different ways when he's low to the ground, so you'll need to be very aware of his movements and when the best time is to press the attack, and when to back off and conserve stamina. 

![Wukong Brook 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3e/Wukong_Brook_18.jpg)

With many of his attacks having severely short range, the Thrust Stance can be incredibly useful to retreat into a heavy attack once you have a focus point. The Pillar Stance can also be useful to gain height over many of his low kicks, but you'll need to make sure you have a lot of spare stamina to soak up his hits. 

![Wukong Brook 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8d/Wukong_Brook_20.jpg)

Since things are rarely as easy as they seem, eliminating his health bar will trigger phase two, whereupon he'll break his restraints and not only fight you with his fists, but supercharge his limbs to deal an insane amount of damage! 

![Wukong Brook 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/db/Wukong_Brook_19.jpg)

Non-Able will always start his second phase with an immediate charge to grab you. This can't be blocked, and the timing can be hard to dodge to the side, so you're better off dodging backward or using Cloud Step when he reaches out with his right hand. Get caught, and you'll take a ton of damage. Be warned if you try to Immobilize him mid-grab, he can often pop out of it and continue the grab animation unless you reposition yourself somewhere safe. 

![Wukong Brook 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/db/Wukong_Brook_21.jpg)

If you can believe it, this boss still has more kick attacks to show off, and can now unleash a quick three-hit combo after starting to crouch down and angle his head to your left. Watch out for his incredibly fast roundhouse kicks to fly out one after the other, and only after the third will he pause to stretch out his leg and give you room to retaliate. 

![Wukong Brook 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fa/Wukong_Brook_22.jpg)

He's even faster at chaining his attacks together, and even after the three-kick combo he can slam the ground with his fist to charge it up, then come at you with a spin, feinting a kick to trick you into dodging before unleashing a blast with his gold glowing fist. 

![Wukong Brook 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/76/Wukong_Brook_33.jpg)

When using his fists, he'll often employ a three hit combo starting with an overhand swing with his right fist, and then a quick straight punch with his left, before expelling energy by opening his left palm for one last strike. 

Any time any of his limbs glow, you'll need to be extremely careful, as getting hit can take off a huge chunk of your life (making consumables that raise your max health even more important!) 

![Wukong Brook 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f4/Wukong_Brook_26.jpg)

This limbs will often glow after he expels energy around him in a damaging wave. Some will start a longer combo move, while others can be a single strike, like leaping into the air to smash down with two glowing fists. 

![Wukong Brook 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8f/Wukong_Brook_27.jpg)

Another can be done at range, so even if you think you're at a safe distance, be ready to dodge if he adopts a stance and then dashes up for a glowing elbow strike attack. 

![Wukong Brook 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/75/Wukong_Brook_28.jpg)

By far his most dangerous move will come when he adopts a martial arts stance, holding a raised fist behind his head while dropping the other arm. 

![Wukong Brook 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ee/Wukong_Brook_24.jpg)

After expelling energy around him (also dealing a lot of damage) to dissuade any attacks you might be trying to land, he'll move forward with a quick 1-2 punch with alternating palm strikes, the second one dealing a massive amount of damage and projecting his strike with extended range. The rapidity of these attacks often ensures that if you try to dodge the first hit, you'll get slammed by the second, and even using Rock Solid will just send you toppling backward. In these instances, using Cloud Step or Immobilize can be beneficial to getting away from this move, but be ready for him to resume the attack after Immobilize ends. 

![Wukong Brook 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c6/Wukong_Brook_29.jpg)

However, he can vary up his moves to keep you guessing. Sometimes after the aforementioned stance, he can also abandon his palm blast for a quick sliding spin kick, so keep an eye on his movements and don't get comfortable in predicting his movements. 

![Wukong Brook 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/42/Wukong_Brook_23.jpg)

That's not the only martial arts stance he can adopt, either. If you see him flex both arms vertically below his face, he'll do a variation on the three-hit palm strike. Only in these cases, he'll often follow up his third attack with a delayed final hit, spinning his body to backhand you with his glowing right hand that can decimate your health bar. 

![Wukong Brook 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a5/Wukong_Brook_25.jpg)

Having stamina in reserve is crucial for this phase, as Non-Able routinely flows into very long combo attacks that are hard to keep pace with. One attack will have him start with a shoulder check, and then expel energy from his raised palm. He'll quickly flow into a sweeping punch and two spinning kicks all in a row, which again is where moves like Cloud Step or Immobilize can help grant you some breathing room. 

Expect this fight to take you awhile to learn. For any chance of winning, you'll need to learn his first phase enough to the point you can power him down quickly before he can do much damage in return, and save the majority of your healing for phase two. 

![Wukong Brook 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/58/Wukong_Brook_31.jpg)

Be sure to experiment using your spells to their fullest. Rock Solid can sometimes knock him back, but often will send you skidding back instead, making Cloud Step a great alternative. We also found Red Tides to be a great transformation spell to keep up with dodging his rapid attacks, though you can also soak the blows with Azure Dust, but you won't be able to land many hits. 

![Wukong Brook 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/11/Wukong_Brook_30.jpg)

You can even try using Pluck of Many to let your summons hit him from behind while you distract his largely single-target attacks. 

Once you have finally defeated Non-Able, you'll be able to obtain the Non-Able Spirit, which has a pretty intense effect for raising your stats while lowering your mana. 

![Wukong Brook 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/01/Wukong_Brook_32.jpg)

There's not much else to loot around the large stone pagoda where you fought Non-Able, so now is a good time to head back to the Forest of Felicity Shrine, and make your way through the canyon where the Frog Guai boss was to enter the next optional area. 

## Towers of Karma

![Wukong Karma 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b5/Wukong_Karma_1.jpg)

The large forested field beyond the Forest of Felicity's canyon is fairly wide open, and as you exit the canyon you'll find a few small trails leading to the right, left and straight ahead. 

![Wukong Karma 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/23/Wukong_Karma_2.jpg)

Take the left path first, and past a Monk Supporter enemy you'll be able to find the top of a stream, similar to the Brook of Bliss, that hugs that wraps around the far side of this region. 

![Wukong Karma 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c0/Wukong_Karma_3.jpg)

This area has its own Crow Diviner, and while not as durable as the one who dropped the Spirit, he can still employ their new Cloud Step-like abilities to turn almost invisible and attack with chilling force. 

![Wukong Karma 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1b/Wukong_Karma_4.jpg)

After defeating this foe, you can grab a green Wisp on a rock, and then head downstream gathering Jade Lotus Plants as you go. Be ready to be ambushed by a few Croaky enemies after hopping down the falls or taking the nearby stairs, and continue on until the stream ends. 

To the right of the water, you'll spot the assorted stone monuments that are the titular Towers of Karma, giving the place a cemetery-like quality. A path winds through these small stone pillars, and is guarded by an assortment of Frozen Corpses, Monk Supporters, and a new enemy. 

![Wukong Karma 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e5/Wukong_Karma_5.jpg)

This Circus Monkey will use its gong to rally the troops and alert any Frozen Corpses nearby to rise and ambush you. Luckily, he's not too strong on his own and can be taken out quickly before focusing on the others. 

### The Treasure Hunter's Quest - Continued

![Wukong Karma 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/df/Wukong_Karma_6.jpg)  
Just down the road from the group of enemies, you can spot the strange treasure hunting man sitting on the large roots of a gnarled tree (provided you met him along the Bitter Coast and saved him from the lesser Apramana Bats). Grab the green Wisp nearby, and try to speak to him, only to learn he's apparently freezing to death.  
Luckily, you have a spell to deal with this very predicament: Ring of Fire. If you don't have it currently equipped, just continue on the path going straight to find the Towers of Karma Shrine guarded by another Circus Monkey and his cohorts, and change your spells there after defeating them.  
![Wukong Karma 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e8/Wukong_Karma_7.jpg)

When you cast the Ring of Fire Spell, the man will gratefully hop into the center, the Treasure Hunter will relay a story about a Melon Garden supposedly hidden nearby, and a chubby boy jumping from a cliff. Putting two and two together, you may realize he's talking about the cliff at the edge of the Brook of Bliss, where we found a cave below it. You can now head to this location, but you'll have to fight a very dangerous foe. It's well worth doing, as you'll gain a very important spell for doing so! 

![Wukong Karma 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b1/Wukong_Karma_8.jpg)

Back at the Towers of Karma Shrine, look ahead to find a large series of statues carved into a wall with a new enemy standing in front of them. This fearsome foe is a Dual-Blade Monk, and has a lot of health and damaging moves (but thankfully won't respawn). 

![Wukong Karma 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/27/Wukong_Karma_9.jpg)

Be ready for him to toss his blades at you as they boomerang back to him, and then dart up close to attack low with sweeping cuts from his blades. Though he can perform long combos that end in powerful uppercuts, he's not immune to being greatly staggered from a well time Rock Solid, so wait for a good moment to upset his attacks and punish him. 

![Wukong Karma 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cf/Wukong_Karma_10.jpg)

Just past this Dual-Blade Monk, you can follow the rest of the trail to arrive at a small muddy field with a lone stone monument. The field is full of Aged Ginseng to harvest (and a few Ginsenglings), but one of them in the middle of the field is much more than it seems: A Yaoguai Chief. 

### Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Battle - Old Ginseng Guai

This hulking brute isn't as deadly as the Non-Able boss fight, but he does has a few tricks up his sleeve. As you might expect, he can deal a lot of damage with poisonous roots much like the lesser Ginsengling, so having antimiasma medicine on hand is a good strategy. 

Many of the Old Ginseng Guai's attacks are slow and hard-hitting, and the guai himself moves at a fairly slow pace, making him the perfect target for hit and run attacks as needed. 

![Wukong Karma 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2a/Wukong_Karma_11.jpg)

He can perform a variety of lurching stomp attacks, many of which will create a small area of poisonous roots. Like the ice frog, you'll want to take back control of the battlefield by reorienting yourself, and use the Thrust Stance to hit him with charged strikes while staying out of the poison. 

![Wukong Karma 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8e/Wukong_Karma_13.jpg)

If he winds up his hand to slam it down into the ground, he'll sneakily send roots your way, which he can use to lock you down and make you unable to flee from his next attack or if you're already stuck in some poison -- but using the Pillar Stance can help you evade his binds. 

![Wukong Karma 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/88/Wukong_Karma_16.jpg)

Even with his slow speed, he's capable of using his stumbling lurches to lunge at you, so be ready for him to attack with an elbow drop with surprising reach, or a flailing kick that sends him staggering toward you. 

![Wukong Karma 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ac/Wukong_Karma_15.jpg)

Many times, he'll end his flailing by spinning around and then falling backward right on top of you. He'll have his own version of Rock Solid when he does this and flash yellow, so it's better to just evade him entirely. 

![Wukong Karma 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6e/Wukong_Karma_14.jpg)

By far his biggest and most threatening move comes when he plants his hand in the ground to grow an increase area of poison roots all around him. The range on this is fairly big, and he'll continue to grow it for some time, giving you a few options: stay well away and heal up, or climb onto your staff (with a full stamina bar) and wait it out. 

![Wukong Karma 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3f/Wukong_Karma_17.jpg)

After he's done creating the root system, he'll finally tear the whole thing up in a massive burst (at which point you can slam down from your Pillar Stance), however in doing so he'll summon a small group of mini Ginsenglings to attack you. 

![Wukong Karma 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/94/Wukong_Karma_18.jpg)

They behave much in the same way as regular Ginsenglings do, moving slightly faster than the boss, which can help you lure them away from his attacks. Prioritize taking them out first so you don't get blindsided later, and try the Ashen Slumber transformation spell to detonate yourself near them, or use Spirit Attacks with wide reaches. 

![Wukong Karma 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/80/Wukong_Karma_12.jpg)

Stick to staying in safe spots to keep using Thrust Stance out of the range of his roots, or Pillar Stance above him, and look for his many openings when he tumbles to the ground to press the attack, and he'll fall before long, granting you both the **Old Ginseng Guai Spirit** , Millenium Ginseng Seeds to give to Chen Loong, and the **Ginseng Cape** to wear. 

![Wukong Karma 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f7/Wukong_Karma_19.jpg)

With the Yaoguai Chief defeated, be sure to check around behind the large stone monument near where you fought the miniboss. On a small snow-covered table, you can find the **Jade Essence** \- a new Gourd Drink that allows you to recover mana as well as health! 

![Wukong Karma 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7f/Wukong_Karma_21.jpg)

From the boss area, you can find another path leading back up past a small wooden arch to the upper field of this region. There's a few wandering enemies to put down around here, including a Crow Diviner standing in a field looking over a Ginsengling hiding in the ground, and a green Wisp to absorb nearby. 

![Wukong Karma 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/56/Wukong_Karma_20.jpg)

You can also find a higher path leading back to the main road through the valley, and fend off the various Frozen Corpses along the ridgeline path. 

![Wukong Karma 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ed/Wukong_Karma_22.jpg)

Nearing a large gate in the distance, look for a clearing on the left near a large tree and small stone monument where you can find a **Treasure Chest** with materials in it. Just beware of a Lesser Apramana Bat lurking in the bushes nearby that will try to pounce on you. 

![Wukong Karma 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/20/Wukong_Karma_23.jpg)

Eventually you'll come to a much larger gate manned by two Wolf Guardians who will jump down to stop you from entering. Their attacks can come fast and overwhelming on both sides, so try to isolate one with Immobilize and focus fire the other down to take them on one at a time. 

Beyond this large gate lies the final sub-region leading to the New Thunderclap Temple. 

## Longevity Road

Heading through the large red gate, you'll find the path curves left toward the Longevity Road Shrine, but a nearby field on the right has an enemy too big to ignore. 

![Wukong Longevity 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b2/Wukong_Longevity_2.jpg)

The Dark-faced Overlord isn't a miniboss, but he does have a lot of health to chip away at. You'll have to repeatedly thwack at his legs while avoiding various stomps or swings with his hellfire arms that can burn you. 

![Wukong Longevity 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e7/Wukong_Longevity_1.jpg)

At range, he can also tear up a huge rock from the ground and throw your way, making him a threat even at a distance (though the rock flies pretty slow). 

Deal enough damage, and the giant will eventually fall to the ground. Use this time to build up several focus points by attacking his head, and Spirit attacks to take more health away. 

![Wukong Longevity 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f0/Wukong_Longevity_3.jpg)

As he struggles to rise, unleash a heavy attack using your Pillar Stance on his head and he'll likely topple back to the ground giving you a bit more time to defeat him. 

![Wukong Longevity 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f7/Wukong_Longevity_4.jpg)

Be sure to look around this area after defeating the overlord, and nearby you can spot a tree atop a large rock where a Wolf Guardian lurks over a **Treasure Chest** full of materials you can claim. 

![Wukong Longevity 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5a/Wukong_Longevity_6.jpg)

In the opposite direction, there's another large rock below a tower up above that you can't reach, but you can search the rock for another Lesser Apramana Bat, and nearby you can find a second **Treasure Chest** under a large tree. 

The most interesting thing around here is just up the small hill past the tower. You'll find a large corpse of some kind at the base of a statue built into the cliffs ahead. 

![Wukong Longevity 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/35/Wukong_Longevity_7.jpg)

This is actually one of the four Captains that the Pagoda Realm Prisoner spoke of, but it looks like someone beat you to putting this captain out of their misery. You can still interact with the body to claim the Spirit of Captain Void-Illusion. And hey, since they still count as a Yaoguai Chief in the journal, that's one less boss to worry about! 

Captain Void-Illusion

![Wukong Longevity 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2d/Wukong_Longevity_8.jpg)

There's not too much else in the field around the high tower, but you can find a green Wisp to absorb both behind the tower, and along the nearby cliff wall below a large statue where a Crow Diviner enemy stands. 

Head back to the main road and defeat the various Frozen Corpses while you head toward a large arch where the Shrine is, plus a green Wisp to absorb. 

![Wukong Longevity 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/91/Wukong_Longevity_5.jpg)

Guarding the Shrine is another Dual-Blade Monk, who thankfully won't respawn when killed, so feel free to go all out with your spells to overpower him after deflecting an attack to stagger him. 

![Wukong Longevity 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1c/Wukong_Longevity_9.jpg)

From here, the large main field in front of you hides several more Frozen Corpse ambushes, plus Falcon Fan-Makers who will try and stop you from reaching the New Thunderclap Temple. However, there is one last side area worth checking out. 

Look for a lower path leading left of the Shrine, and you'll find a road leading along the ridge above the Towers of Karma into another wooded area. This place is effectively one big loop, with a lower and upper path to take. 

![Wukong Longevity 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e9/Wukong_Longevity_10.jpg)

The lower path will lead past another Crow Diviner, and up some stairs to an area with several stone monuments where the path diverges. 

![Wukong Longevity 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/57/Wukong_Longevity_11.jpg)

A glowing pot can be seen on a small wooden platform, but guarding it is a new formidable opponent. The strangely named Turtle Treasure is a stout skull-faced yaoguai with a large mace it can use to swing in wide arcs or slams, and can also thrust out its belly at you like the Frog Guai bosses, or leap into the air for a butt slam. 

![Wukong Longevity 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4f/Wukong_Longevity_12.jpg)

What makes them truly dangerous is the more they swing their mace, the more small fires will begin to appear around it. Once the fires have grown, any of their weapon slams will now deal huge explosions that can be a pain to deal with. 

![Wukong Longevity 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/09/Wukong_Longevity_13.jpg)

Make use of your spells to keep the foe off-balance and to get away from their explosive attacks, and once they've been defeated, jump and perform a heavy attack to smash the glowing pot on the small wooden platform to gain an Awaken Wine Worm! 

![Wukong Longevity 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a3/Wukong_Longevity_14.jpg)

If you want something to pair with that worm, keep moving along the lower path as it goes up some stairs, and you'll eventually reach the end of this loop, where a small tree stands at the end of a large field with a Luojia Fragrant Vine. However, you'll need to defeat not one but two Falcon Fan-Makers to claim it! 

![Wukong Longevity 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a2/Wukong_Longevity_15.jpg)

Defeating the pair is no easy attacks when you consider their hit-and-run tactics, so you may need to even the odds with A Pluck of Many Spell, or use a combination of Cloud Step and Immobilize to isolate and focus fire one of the Falcons, and then take out the second. 

![Wukong Longevity 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cc/Wukong_Longevity_16.jpg)

Once you have the vine, take the upper path back toward the Longevity Road Shrine, where you'll encounter a two Crow Diviners - one up on a ledge to lure you, and a friend hiding in the bushes nearby.

The most important note is that you can find another Dark-faced Overlord here. Keep focusing on battering his legs to get him to fall and you can attack his skull, and when he dies he'll drop the Gold Spikeplate Curio! 

![Wukong Longevity 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/89/Wukong_Longevity_18.jpg)

Be sure to inspect the woods behind where the giant was posted, and you'll find one last Crow Diviner guarding a **Treasure Chest** with some materials inside.

Finally, with every area explored, it's time to get out of here. Cross the large field past the Longevity Road Shrine and you'll find a passage through the cliffs to the nearby temple.

As you approach, a large bloody miasma will block your advance. Once it congeals, you'll find yourself facing the last of the four captains. 

### Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Captain Kalpa-Wave

As the last of the four captains, Kalpa-Wave looks scarier than he actually is, especially once you learn his tricks. 

With his large towering body, Kapla-Wave has a few physical attacks that generally alternate between stomps of his legs, or a mighty leap that causes him to crash into the ground, but both attacks aren't too bad to deal with. 

What really makes Kalpa-Wave unique is his ability to spew blood out. Lots of it. This can take on many forms, and you'll need to know how to deal with each of them. 

![Wukong Longevity 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/58/Wukong_Longevity_23.jpg)

One of the most basic attacks will be when it spews out a group of bloody projectiles from its body. They'll take to the air before arcing slowly over in your direction, but spinning your staff can let you clear them without issue. 

Sometimes he'll throw several blood attacks into the mix one after the other to mess you up. Expect these bloody trails to come out in multiple directions (both above and from the sides) to try and confuse you, but remain focused on deflecting them as they arrive.

Other times he'll mix up his blood projectiles by also creating more blood, which include a stomp attack (or bending down to tilt the wings on its back) that generates a trail of blood heading in your direction. Dodge the blood trails, or they'll burst into a bloody lotus flowers that damage you as they erupt.

The real danger isn't the lotus itself, its what it leaves behind. Similar to that Frog Guai's ice attacks coating the area in frost, many of Kalpa-Wave's attacks (including stomps!) will leave behind large pools of blood. Stepping into any of these pools for a second will start to drain your health, so you'll need to steer clear of them at all costs! 

![Wukong Longevity 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/93/Wukong_Longevity_25.jpg)

Much of this fight will come down to being constantly mobile to evade the various pools of blood Kalpa-Wave will create, and find times after deflecting his projectiles to run up and unleash damage on the boss. 

![Wukong Longevity 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ad/Wukong_Longevity_26.jpg)

Be especially careful if Captain Kalpa-Wave starts to jump up and down repeatedly. On the third jump, all pools of blood will explode into explosive lotus flowers, meaning you'll need to either be on the move, or use your Pillar Stance to rise above the attacks. 

![Wukong Longevity 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c6/Wukong_Longevity_21.jpg)

The good news is Kalpa-Wave is extremely susceptible to getting knocked down. So long as you build up some focus points with light attacks where possible, you can use your Pillar Stance heavy attack with three focus points built up to send the boss crashing to the ground -- which is the perfect time to Immobilize him on the ground and go wild with Spirit Attacks and Transformations. 

![Wukong Longevity 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b5/Wukong_Longevity_27.jpg)

Beyond this, Kalpa-Wave doesn't have too many other variations on his moves, so as long as you avoid those blood pools, you'll be able to cut him down to size, and gain the Spirit of Captain Kalpa-Wave to add to your collection. 

There's a Shrine at the start of the next area just beyond the entrance gate, and you can use this as the perfect opportunity to return back to the Pagoda Realm. 

### Completing the Pagoda Prisoner's Quest

Head back to the Lower Pagoda Shrine, and revisit the Pagoda Realm Prisoner (aka, the Third Prince of Flowing Sands). He will be grateful for your work in putting his captains to rest, and will award you the **Chubai Spearhead** , which allows you to craft a spear variant of your trusty staff: the Chu-Bai Spear! 

![Wukong Longevity final.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Wukong_Longevity_final.jpg)

With the Valley of Ecstasy officially cleared of threats, you can now begin to explore the final region of **New Thunderclap Temple**.
