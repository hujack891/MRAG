## Wandering Wight Location

Wandering White is in a small clearing in Black Wind Mountain. Head straight ahead from the Outside the Forest Keeper's Shrine and over the bridge to find the clearing on the right. 

## Wandering Wight Fight

Wandering Wight has a series of extremely hard-hitting attacks, and he's not afraid to use them. Some of these attacks can potentially one-shot you, so learning how to recognize and dodge them will make the fight much easier. Here are the attacks you can expect to see from Wandering Wight: 

  * Ground Pound Attack (this attack has a massive aftershock that rips the surrounding ground up)
  * Ground Smash
  * Swipe Attack
  * Stomp Attack

Wandering Wight's swipe and stomp attacks are easy enough to avoid with the right timing. The ground pound moves, however, are the most dangerous tricks he has up his sleeves. The aftershocks that tear up the ground after those attacks can destroy you just as easily as they do the arena. The best way to combat those aftershocks is to run away and get as much distance between you and Wandering Wight as possible before the ground fractures.

You won't be equipped to absorb this power when you defeat Wandering Wight. This Spirit and all others that you miss can be cultivated at a Keeper's Shrine.

  * **Faithful Kowtow**
  * Equipped Effect: Significantly increases Defense.

Wandering Wight's Spirit Power is called **Faithful Kowtow**. Faithful Kowtow allows you to take the form of Wandering Wight and ram his head into enemies, dealing them massive damage. This is one of the best Spirit Powers, and it holds up throughout the entire game. Wandering Wight's Power can also be used to destroy the wall leading to a secret area in the First Prince of Flowing Sands arena.
