## Where to Find Guangmou

As a required boss fight, you won't be able to miss Guangmou as you advance through the Black Wind Mountain. You'll find him halfway through the Bamboo Grove once you reach Snake Way.

Follow the main path across the bridge from the Shrine and down to a stream, and follow it into a large bamboo forest patrolled by snakes. On the opposite side of the circular forest, you can spot two small statues forming an entrance into the grove where Guagnmou lurks. 

### Guangmou Mini-Boss Fight and Guide

Guangmou is one of the more tricky fights you’ll have faced so far, relying on a variety of sneaky projectile attacks to keep you on the defensive and limit your ability to pursue him. Though he’s not technically a snake, you will find yourself in danger of being poisoned during this fight, so you may want to buy a few anti-poison medicine from the Shrine’s shop.

He’ll almost always begin the fight by summoning a cluster of homing ghostly projectiles that burst out of him before tracking you down. You can avoid the group by dodging to the side, or holding down your staff spin until they’ve been deflected.

However, Guangmou will usually create these as a distraction, and teleport up close to you while you’re busy trying to dodge his projectiles. Once he’s up close, beware of his poison spitting attack where he sprays in a large area in front of him.

His other main projectile attack comes out much faster, as he levitates off the ground for a moment before shooting out a line of the spells in front of him. They don’t track you like the others, but they will shoot rapidly downward and into the ground in front of him.

When he’s got some range on you, listen up for some of his call-outs. If he yells “Storm forth!” he’ll soon create a gusty orb surrounded by leaves that will slowly float toward you. This one can’t be deflected since it won’t do damage on its own. Once it reaches your position, the gust will issue forth and in a moment become a small violent tornado that will knock you down!

An interesting note is that he needs to control the orb’s direction, meaning you can cast Immobilize when he summons the orb to lock both him and his projectile in place, nullifying the attack! 

Sometimes, he won’t even bother with the orb, and will simply wave his fan rapidly to create a tornado at your last known position, so staying mobile and pressing your attack can help you avoid these attacks.

Easily the most annoying move in his repertoire is when he calls out to his “Boys”. He’ll then summon a number of poisonous snakes out of the ground all over the arena, who will all spit venom at you around 5-6 times before vanishing. While they technically do have health bar, it’s not worth engaging with any of them — giving you two viable options: Run and dodge like crazy, or find a corner of the arena where you can see them all, and use your staff spin to nullify the projectiles. This last trick won’t last forever due to the stamina drain, and also due to Guangmou’s meddling during the summons, but it can provide a temporary respite.

The good news is other than his poison spray, Guangmou doesn’t really have any melee attacks to defend himself at close range — other than a very slow repulsing explosion he needs to charge up by spinning while he gathers energy. Use this to your advantage by pressing your light attack combos whenever you close the gap, and if you have defeated the Wandering Wight, use its Spirit Attack to knock him down with a mighty headbutt to keep him from teleporting away.

Another good strategy to note is that if you’re in danger of getting close to becoming poisoned, using the Red Tides spell can help you transform out of danger. Any status effects suffered while transformed as Guangzhi will be removed when you regain your regular health bar. As an added bonus, Guangmou will even comment on your transformation. 

Once you’ve learned how to evade his projectiles, the rest of the fight will just boil down to chasing him down and stunning him however you can with Immobilize, your Spirit Attack, and other heavy hits. When he falls, you’ll gain Guangmou’s Spirit to add to your collection, allowing you to summon venomous snakes of your own! 

## Black Wind Mountain’s Secret - Ringing the Second Bell

As the boss falls, the Keeper will comment on the two fallen Yaoguai Guangmou and Guangzhi. Both monks apparently aided an Elder named Jinchi to burn down the temple and the monk within alive — but that’s not all they share: Just up the sloping stairway path to the left of the way forward, you can find a second large bell that you can ring. Something ominous seems to be responding to the sound of these bells.
