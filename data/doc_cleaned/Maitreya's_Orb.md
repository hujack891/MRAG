# Maitreya's Orb

Maitreya's Orb is one of the many Curios items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. 

With the Maitreya's Orb equipped, when you land enough successful hits on an enemy, a fatal blow you recieve will be negated. 

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Maitreya's Orb Location

The Maitreya's Orb can be found in the Valley of Ecstasy in The New West, specifically at the Mindfullness Cliff Shrine. From the Shrine, head up the long staircase ahead and continue along until you reach the room with the lit torches. Sitting in the box you can find the orb.
