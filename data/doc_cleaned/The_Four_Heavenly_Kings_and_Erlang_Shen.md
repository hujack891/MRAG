# The Four Heavenly Kings and Erlang Shen

The Four Heavenly Kings and Erlang Shen are optional secret bosses you can find by entering Chapter 3's Secret Area of Mount Mei in Black Myth: Wukong. You'll need to complete all chapters' secret areas and an elusive side quest to access the area, then take on the incredibly strong Erlang, The Sacred Divinity. Completing this Kaiju fight will allow you to unlock the game's secret ending. 

## How to Find The Four Heavenly Kings and Erlang Shen

You'll automatically enter this fight once you've beaten Erlang, The Sacred Divinity in Mount Mei.

After crash landing back on Mount Mei, two giants will emerge. This is the Destined One's Stone Monkey form and Erlang Shen. When Erlang is thrown off into the distance, you'll be thrown into a fight against the Four Heavenly Kings.

Thankfully after a huge battle against Erlang, The Sacred Divinity, the fight against the Four Heavenly Kings is much more straightforward. They share one health bar between them, and in your Stone Monkey transformation, you can use Primal Punch as your light attack, Earthshatter Slam as your heavy attack (this attack also heals), and Rock Solid to deflect their hits. 

Use Rock Solid when it's available and when one of the four giants will launch themselves at you. Other than that, you'll just want to keep using Primal Punch to build up Focus. When you've built your points, use Earthshatter Slam.

About halfway through the fight, you'll also be able to start using Ice Bath. When you use the Ice Bath Spell, the Stone Monkey's arms will be covered in frost, and when you punch, you'll inflict frost damage. 

The Four Heavenly Kings

When the Four Heavenly Kings have been taken down, there's just one more giant to deal with, which is Erlang Shen.

You should similarly approach the fight to the Four Heavenly Kings, and use Primal Punch to build up your Focus. When it's built up, use Earthshatter Slam to replenish your health and perform a heavy attack, and keep Rock Solid for moments when you can deflect Erlang Shen's blade attack. 

When Erlang Shen's health reaches around 70%, he'll imbue his sword with fire, and start to use it as a whip. This will make the fight a bit tougher, but you'll replenish your health whenever you use Eartshatter Slam. Be sure to use Ice Bath to counter these fire attacks.

Around the halfway mark, Erlang Shen will grab you and breath fire on you. Your health bar will drain all the way down, but you won't die. instead, you'll switch to Fiery Fist and be able to perform Scorch Shower instead of Icy Fists. Your health bar will slowly replenish after this, and the second part of the fight will begin.

Just keep pummelling away at Erlang Shen and making use of all the Spells until he's defeated.
