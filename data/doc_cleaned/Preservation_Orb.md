# Preservation Orb

The Preservation Orb is one of the many Curios items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. 

With the Preservation Orb equipped upon resurrection in a battle, your maximum health mana, and stamina will be increased for a long duration. 

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Preservation Orb Location

The Preservation Orb can be found in The Webbed Hollow, in a box at the start of the Purple Cloud Mountain Secret area. This is only accessible after completing Chapter 4, providing you haven't finished the area. 

A full guide on how to access Purple Cloud Mountain can be found in the video below:
