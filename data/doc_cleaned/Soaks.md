# Soaks

Black Myth: Wukong has a selection of Gourd Soaks you can equip that offers an additional buff to your Gourd. This buff can change how you use it, offering a boost to your attack, elemental resistance, as well as providing boosts to your overall health. Additionally, some of the Soaks have the ability to give your spells extra damage. 

Soaks are more common than the Drinks for your Gourds, and can often be found throughout the gameâ€™s chapters. So, you will need to head off the beaten path to find them all.
