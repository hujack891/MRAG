# Xu Dog Questline

The Xu Dog is a friendly character and merchant you can meet in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong. This character will teach you the art of crafting consumable medicine, and eventually allow you to invest in passive buffs. 

## In the Sandgate Village

You can first encounter the **Xu Dog** just outside the Sandgate Village of Chapter 2’s Yellow Wind Ridge. Once you first enter the region, head along the main path across the pond and left along a ridge to reach the **Village Entrance Shrine**.

Look just beyond the shrine for a small ditch running under a wooden bridge. Follow the ditch through the opposite path under the bridge, and head right to a tunnel. Inside, apart from a green Wisp you can absorb for some Will and a mushroom to harvest, you can spot a grubby yet friendly canine deity.

The Xu Dog has a problem he needs help with: A **large frog** has swallowed one of his medicinal formulas, and you’re just the person he’s looking for to get it back. You’ll find the frog miniboss Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw nearby in a large pit, and it can employ electrical attacks to defend itself.

Once you defeat this frog boss, he’ll drop the **Evil Repelling Medicament formula**. Return it to the Xu dog back outside the pit. Not only will he reward you with **2 Evil Repelling Medicament** for your trouble, but you’ll also unlock the ability to **create all sorts of consumables yourself** at any Shrine. With all the materials you’ve been harvesting, you can stock up on defensive, offensive, and status reducing consumables. 

## In the Crouching Tiger Temple Cellar

The next time you can find the Xu Dog is a bit later in Chapter 2, and is hidden below the Crouching Tiger Temple. To access the cellar, you will need both the **Sterness of Stone** and **Keeness of Tiger** from the two Vanguard bosses: The Stone Vanguard and Tiger Vanguard. You can then interact with the tally in the middle of the temple by the headless statue to **uncover a secret tunnel**.

Fight your way through the tunnel to find a cave path leading outside to a steep one-way slope. Slide down the rest of the way, and you’ll come up to a Shrine for the **Crouching Tiger Temple’s Cellar**. In the far corner of the cellar, you’ll find a familiar friendly face - the Xu Dog you helped get medicine recipes for! 

Talk to him while he’s in front of his large furnace, and the Xu Dog will thank you for your help thus far with a Mind Core. He'll also teach you the art of **crafting your own Celestial Medicines** in addition to the Mortal Medicine consumables you’ve been creating.

Celestial Medicines are sort of like **passive buffs** you can apply by trading in **Mind Cores** , which can be found in a variety of places - both by defeating bosses and sometimes regular enemies, or in chests. The buffs range from the familiar ones like health/stamina/mana increases much like the Celestial Pills, but also other stats like Crit Chance or resistance to certain afflictions. 

The best part of these new passive buffs is that you have the option to reset them like your Skill Tree, which will give you back all the Mind Cores you’ve used thus far, allowing you to come back and reallocate points to suit your needs. 

## Helping Chen Loong Restore the Zodiac Village

During Chapter 3, once you arrive at the North Shore of the Bitter Lake, you can fight an old dragon along the shore known as Chen Loong, who will then complain that his old bones are in need of medicine. 

Travel back to the Xu Dog in the Cellar below the Crouching Tiger Temple, and talk to him to receive the medicine that Chen Loong needs. 

As a reward, Chen Loong will give you a special scroll to visit the Zodiac Village, where several merchants will now permanently reside, including the Xu Dog. You can now return to him periodically to request free medicine, and he'll give you a handful of random consumables each time.
