# Giant Shigandang

Giant Shigandangis one of the optional Yaoguai Kings you can fight in Chapter 6 of Black Myth: Wukong. It's the only Yaoguai King that will be recorded in your Journal in Chapter 6. Unlocking it will require collecting Skandhas across the 5 previous chapters. 

## How to Find the Giant Shigandang

To be able to summon it, you'll need to have collected the Skandhas through the previous Chapters. If you haven't already got your hands on these Skandhas, follow our guide to collecting them all here. 

Go to the clearing behind where you fought the Son of Stones, just off to the left. You'll see some water, a large rock to the left of it, and two golden trees on either side of the rock. You want to go to the right of the water to find the secret area that will take you to the hidden boss.

You'll need to ascend quite high up, but where the path reaches a dead end, up above there's an opening in the cliff that you can pass through. Follow this until you enter an area that's slightly covered and pass through this tunnel.

As you emerge in the wide open space, a Giant Shigandang will appear. 

## Giant Shigandang Boss Fight and Guide

Unfortunately, despite its size, you will need to be on foot during the fight. The key to defeating this enormous rocky monster is to head for its fits and attack the blue crystals you can on them.

Its main attack is to punch down with its giant fists, which unsurprisingly, will one-shot you if you're hit by them. The easiest way to avoid them is to just back up as far away from them as possible. Then, once the Giant Shigandang pauses punching, run up to the fists and keep hitting the blue crystals. 

The other attack that the Shigandang does is to punch both fists down and send out ripples. Again, you want to hang back as much as you can. The rings will come toward you, and you can jump over them to avoid them. There are times when he'll raise both hands in the air, and seem like he's about to perform this attack, but instead, he's actually going to slam his fists down and just lay there for a bit. This is the perfect time to get in close and attack him.

After defeating the boss, climb the arm that touches the ground and you'll meet the monkey again. Let the cutscene play and you'll get the Skandha of Consciousness.
