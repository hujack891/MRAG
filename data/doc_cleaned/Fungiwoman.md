# Fungiwoman

The Fungiwoman is an optional Yaoguai Chief boss fight that you can find during Chapter 4 of Black Myth Wukong, though she is not officially tracked as a yaoguai chief in your journal. Located in the Temple of Yellow Flowers on a high hill, she hides among Monkey-Head Mushrooms. 

  * Rewards: Fungiwoman Spirit, Monkey-Head Fungus Seed, Knot of Voidness, 1562 Experience, 1473 Will

## Where to Find the Fungiwoman

The Fungiwoman is a hidden optional boss that hides like most other fungi guai. After reaching the entrance of the Temple of Yellow Flowers, proceed on the main path until you find a fork in the road, with the left path leading to the Court of Illumination. 

Take the right path instead, and climb a mountain path up to a high ridge, leading to a shack with several mushrooms around it. One of the Monkey-Head Fungus on the right will actually be the Fungiwoman in hiding. 

## Fungiwoman Beetle Boss Fight and Guide

The Fungiwoman behaves almost identically to the Fungiman you fight fought in the Pagoda Realm (and a few times after), only they'll have a bit more health, and deal a bit more damage, but you should know what to expect for most of their attacks. Though they have a boss healthbar, they aren't tracked in your journal for Yaoguai Chief entries. 

When they rise out of their hiding spot, they'll flood the immediate area with poison, and can do so multiple times, so always be ready to back off when you see noxious fumes billowing up and swap to Thrust Stance.

The Fungiwoman can also expel toxic strands from its side to seek you out, but can thankfully by swept aside with a staff spin. The same can also happen if they slam their staff down, creating geysers that spawn additional projectiles.

Like the Fungiman, this variant can fly through the air to slam down from above on you, only with this move they'll also create poison geysers all around them to spawn the aforementioned projectiles.

Another move they share is their rapid spin attack that will seek you out. Keep your distance or use Immobilize to score free hits, and then wait until they fall dizzy to hit them with more attacks. 

For all their extra health, they don't have too many more moves than a regular enemy, so keep on the offensive so they don't have a chance to sprout more spore projectiles, using Immobilize to lock them down and Rock Solid when they try to swipe at you with their staff. 

Once defeated, you'll gain a Knot of Voidness, and a Monkey-Head Fungus Seed to take back to the Zodiac Village, as well as their Fungiwoman Spirit to absorb.

Be sure to check the shack on the far end before leaving, as you'll find the **Sunset of the Nine Skies Drink** sittng on a table, which will restore Qi as well as health!
