# Turtle Tear

The Turtle Tear is one of the Epic Soaks for your Gourds in Black Myth: Wukong. The Soak's ability is strong, useful for almost any build. 

With the Turtle Tear Soak equipped, when at full health, using the gourd recovers a moderate amount of mana. 

Soaks can't be upgraded in the game, unlike the Drinks and the Gourd. This buff you get will stay as it is and can't be increased. Therefore, if you want to switch to a different Soak, head back to the Shen Monkey vendor. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Turtle Tear Location

The Turtle Tear can be found in the North Shore of the Bitter Lake area in The New West. From the Shrine, stick to the right side of the coast and continue all the way along until you reach the large skeleton at the back.

Interact with this skeleton to spawn the Soak back on the shoreline by Turtle Island.

Soaks are far more plentiful than the drinks for your gourds. They are scattered throughout the game, across each chapter. For even more guides on these areas, check out our full Black Myth: Wukong walkthrough. You can also keep track of the Awaken Wine Worm locations and Luoija Fragrant Vine locations, which are key to upgrading your healing potential and Gourd.
