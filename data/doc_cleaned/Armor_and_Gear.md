# Armor and Gear

Armor and Gear form the core of your defence in Black Myth: Wukong. The defense buffs and extra buffs are vital for suvival as you progress through the game's chapters in our Walkthrough. Armor and Gear sets also come with set bonuses that are unlocked upon equipping several pieces of gear within the same set. 

Most Armor and Gear can be crafted after you beat specific bosses or enemies. However, some have to be found throughout the game's open world.
