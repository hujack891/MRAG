  * **Swift Leap**
  * Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Critical Hit Chance of Jump Heavy Attacks.

The Mountain Patroller's Spirit Power allows you to take his form and leap into the air, releasing a flurry of slashes at your foe. It's a decently strong attack, compounded by the equipped effect, which increases your chances of landing a Critical Hit when performing Heavy Jump Attacks. You can make this even stronger in your skill tree by increasing the damage dealt by Critical Hits and further increasing your chances of landing a Critical Hit.
