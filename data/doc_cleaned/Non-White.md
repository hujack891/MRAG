# Non-White

Non-White is a required miniboss fight, and one of Yellowbrow's four disciples that you can encounter in Chapter 3 of Black Myth Wukong. This Yaoguai Chief is sent to block your progress into the Valley of Ecstasy, but you'll need to fight him twice to defeat this foe.

## Where to Find Non-White

Non-White will attempt to ambush you early into your exploration for the entrance to the Valley of Ecstasy after you climb up from the Bitter Lake in The New West. Upon reaching the Mindfullness Cliff, you'll encounter him at the top platform in an outdoor area circling a large pit. 

### Non-White Miniboss Fight and Guide

Non-White is a peculiar foe who attacks in haphazard fashion with his large thin blade. The most important thing to note is the smaller bar above his health bar: Non-White can use his blade to repeatedly block and parry your attacks, which can at times effectively give him a second health bar. Finding the right times to strike can be useful in circumventing his defenses, but you'll want to be wary of his frost and poison attacks. Stock up on both Antimiasma and Body-Warming medicine to deal with both scenarios should they arise.

Expect Non-White to close the distance on you rapidly, as his most common move starts with him crouching before rolling toward you, and then sliding his blade up into a jump attack for a second strike, followed by a short pause before performing a very wide swing with his frost-enchanted blade.

With a bit of practice you'll be able to get the rhythm down for evading this attack, but that's only half the problem. Non-White will follow this attack by slowly moving his weapon in front of him, during which time he'll be able to easily block any retaliating attack you might have. If you want to get past his defenses, try Immobilizing him first and then hitting him from the back where he can't defend himself.

Another of his dangerous combo moves will start with a quick shout and an upward thrust of his blade followed by a quick jab. He'll then adopt a strange pose by lifting a leg up, only to dash at you with extreme speed for a final two-hit strike that can be dodged or deflected to get him off-balance.

If you spot him twirl his blade up behind him, be ready for a quick dash forward as he slashes upward, and then slams down to create a trail of ice in front of him. Thankfully, unlike some of the other moves, this will lead him wide open if you dodge to his side and strike back.

Finally, he can also simply hang back and toss two poison-coated daggers your way in a quick throw, requiring good reaction time to evade. 

Note that if you try to press your attack while he's in an idle or defensive posture, he'll eventually deflect your combo with a louder block noise, and then retaliate -- but you can beat him at his own game by deflecting after his deflection.

If you've got a good idea of his attack patterns, using the Smash Stance's varied combo to "see through" his attacks can be extremely useful to power through his slices to hit him while he's unable to defend, and the follow-up heavystrike you can unlock usually can't be blocked by him either. 

The good news is once you've taken out half of his real health bar (not his sword's defense bar), he'll break off the attack and retreat. The bad news is you haven't seen the last of him. 

Continue taking the path up the cliffs to reach a large open area with an archway at the far end leading to a huge valley, and on the right you'll find Non-White at a Meditation Spot waiting for round two. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-White (Round Two)

In addition to the previously discussed moves Non-White utilized in your last encounter, he'll get even more aggressive with sneaky frost attacks, making using the Fiery Gourd a very smart investment to keep from getting chilled, or you can use the Ring of Fire to get some breathing room and recover. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d7/Wukong_Mindcliff_18.jpg)

Non-White will charge his blade by lunging at you with a quick back-handed slice, before dragging his blade along the ground to slash upward and send out a row of icy spikes in a straight line. 

![Wukong MindCliff 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/66/Wukong_MindCliff_19.jpg)

He'll now also swap his stance to pivot and look back at you over his shoulder, before leaping over with a quick slash and then jumping up to hang in the air a moment as his blade charges before making an extremely fast dash across the room with his frost sword. 

Since you'll need to fully defeat him this round, it's more than likely that you'll end up smashing through the defense from his weapon and removing the bar entirely. Unfortunately, this isn't necessarily a good thing. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c9/Wukong_Mindcliff_20.jpg)

Non-White will quickly perform his own type of Cloud Step to evade you and retreat, replacing his longer frozen sword with two smaller poison blades, and will have a whole new attack set during this temporary phase. While it does mean he can no longer block you until his frost blade regenerates, you'll need to be wary of taking too much poison damage. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0a/Wukong_Mindcliff_21.jpg)

Among his new attacks, he can quickly launch into two slashes, and then crouch down and pivot to charge in a final dashing strike meant to chase you down if you try and dodge away -- but you can deflect this final move to stop him in his tracks. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/20/Wukong_Mindcliff_22.jpg)

If you don't deflect, be ready for him to turn around after the charge and launch a barrage of poison daggers in your direction that are much harder to get out of the way of if you aren't ready to start strafing. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ea/Wukong_Mindcliff_23.jpg)

Another dangerous attack that can be hard to follow will start with him moving erratically in his mist form to close the distance to you, and start with a spinning slash attack. As the momentum carries him in a circle, he'll return to face you by spewing poison in your face. Since it's a ranged attack you won't be able to deflect this one, but you can dodge to the side while sprays straight ahead. 

When he crouches down while crossing his blades, he'll leap over for a low jump attack with both daggers, followed by two delayed swings of his poisoned weapons, and ending with a quick uppercut attack. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/16/Wukong_Mindcliff_24.jpg)

One last move he can perform quickly when at a distance is using his vanishing act to slide along the ground and then feint up in the air to the side of you before slashing down at an angle. He'll do this twice in a row to keep your guessing at his movements, ending with a slam attack that will break the ground around him even if he misses you. 

![Wukong Mindcliff 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/71/Wukong_Mindcliff_25.jpg)

With so many feinting attacks and vanishing, it can be hard to get a bead on him, and unfortunately, he tends to escape from Immobilization almost instantly, so you'll need to save that for when his frozen sword regenerates, and instead focus on deflecting his wild strikes to stop him in his tracks. Since many of his attacks are low to the ground, it's not a bad idea to swap to the Pillar Stance during this phase to attack him from above, rather than continuing to rely on the Smash Stance to see through his attacks if he'll just feint away. 

There's a good chance he'll revert back to his original weapon before the fight is done, so make sure to adapt your tactics accordingly, and use a Transformation Spell like Red Tides to keep up with his movements.

When Non-White finally falls, you'll be able to claim the Non-White Spirit from him, and also make use of the **Meditation Spot** nearby to claim a free Skill Point.
