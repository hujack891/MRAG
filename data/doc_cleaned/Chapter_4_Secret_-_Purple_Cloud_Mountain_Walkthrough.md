# Chapter 4 Secret - Purple Cloud Mountain Walkthrough

The Purple Cloud Mountain is a Secret Area found in Chapter 4's Webbed Hollow of Black Myth Wukong. Below you'll find a guide to accessing the mountain by defeating the Venom Daoist, and how to complete Hong Yi the Snake Guai's quest to defeat the Daoist Mi and Duskveil, as well as the formidable Scorpionlord.

This Chapter 4 Secret can only be accessed by finding and defeating the Venom Daoist in two different locations, and will transport you to a different location to fight a secret Yaoguai King and repair a Vessel that is instrumental in defeating the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master. 

## How to Access Purple Cloud Mountain

Unlike other Secret Areas in previous chapters, accessing the Purple Cloud Mountain is fairly straightforward, and only requires you to track down and defeat an optional boss character in both locations he's hiding in. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a2/Wukong_UpperHollow_33.jpg)

The first time you can find the Venom Daoist, he'll be hiding in the Upper Hollow of the major Webbed Hollow region. You can find it by circling the first area to the right, dropping down a hole to a slightly lower level, and fighting your way through tunnels full of hanging cocoons to reach the Pools of Shattered Jade Shrine. 

![Wukong UpperHollow 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/47/Wukong_UpperHollow_35.jpg)

The Venom Daoist will be hiding in a large cocoon just past the shrine in a large darkened room. You'll need to break him out of the cocoon, and then defeat this boss (attacking his back to destroy his extra hands will deal major damage and can end the fight early). 

Once defeated, he'll vow revenge and flee, and you won't see him again until escaping the Webbed Hollow. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/53/Wukong_YellowFlower_36.jpg)

After reaching the Temple of Yellow Flowers, head all the way through to the temple until you reach a large forked path by a tree and large boulder. To the left you'll find the Court of Illumination Shrine, but taking the right path leads up a long twisting mountain path. 

![Wukong YellowFlower 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bb/Wukong_YellowFlower_43.jpg)

As soon as you reach the top of the stairs, look to the left to find a sloping path back down to a large arena, where the Venom Daoist will attack again, this time with only two extra arms. You can quickly reach his second phase by breaking off his two extra arms, after which you'll have a much more difficult second phase. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/86/Wukong_PurpleCloud_1.jpg)

When the Venom Daoist is finally defeated, he'll point to a mural that will appear on a nearby wall, sending you to Purple Cloud Mountain. 

## Purple Cloud Mountain

When you appear in this new area, you'll find it's much larger than the other secret areas in previous chapter, hiding not one, not two -- but three bosses. Two of these can be missed and made unavailable if you beeline to the final boss, so fair warning! 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Wukong_PurpleCloud_2.jpg)

The start of this region is a linear mountain path lined with a few materials to harvest, and up ahead you'll hear the sounds of someone crying. The "someone" is actually a snake guai (named Hong Yi). The widower was forced out of her mountaintop village by insect guais led by the Scorpionlord, rendering her unable to retrieve her late husband's keepsakes. 

She'll warn you of the dangerous venom of the enemies ahead, and you can even find a **Treasure Chest** near her that holds 3 Antimiasma Powder that will be incredibly useful when taking on the Scorpionlord. 

Head across the bridge to the right and grab a green Wisp, and go through the archway into the next larger area. 

## Valley of Blooms

Head along the path to the right to reach the Valley of Blooms Shrine. As with previous Secret Areas, this one has its own separate shop where you can purchase things not found in the rest of the Webbed Hollow, which can help you toward crafting better weapons and armor: 

Purple Cloud Mountain Shrine Shop   
| Purple Cloud Mountain Shrine Shop      | Purple Cloud Mountain Shrine Shop | Purple Cloud Mountain Shrine Shop  | Purple Cloud Mountain Shrine Shop   |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |

![Wukong PurpleCloud 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/43/Wukong_PurpleCloud_3.jpg)

The area before you is larger than you might expect, and a little confusing to navigate at first. One of two large peaks lies across the bridge near the Shrine, with paths to the left and right. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/59/Wukong_PurpleCloud_8.jpg)

There's also a small pond below the bridge featuring a few materials to harvest and a green Wisp to absorb right under the bridge, and another on the far right side. 

If you take the path left after crossing the bridge, you'll find that it leads along the main path where you can find a Tree Pearl, and nearby another tree will spring to life! 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3f/Wukong_PurpleCloud_4.jpg)

The Lushleaf is a tree spirit that attacks fairly slowly, either stomping down or swinging its head in wide arcs to hit you -- though it can also perform a surprisingly fast low sweeping kick. 

If you notice it make a strange gesture with its hands, it will summon two smaller tree-like enemies to assist it that can also perform a variety of kicks, but have much less health. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cd/Wukong_PurpleCloud_5.jpg)

Watch for a Dragonfly Guai hiding in a left alcove as you move further up the path, and you'll find a large archway gate guarded by an empowered Snake Herbalist. Before charging in, you may notice a sloping path to the left of the gate where an archer waits, but there's another path just to the right across from where the Dragonfly Guai was. 

This leads up to yet another Dragonfly Guai archer overlooking the gate who will ambush you if you try to attack the snake or his other archer friend. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b1/Wukong_PurpleCloud_6.jpg)

Try taking this foe out first, and you'll find a winding path leading up to the peak, across a fallen tree trunk to a high peak, where you'll find a wooden **Treasure Chest** next to the fallen log that holds the **Gold Sun Crow Curio** (bolstering its effect when paired with the Jade Moon Rabbit!). 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c2/Wukong_PurpleCloud_7.jpg)

From here you can head down across the top of the archway gate where a green Wisp floats, allowing you to come back down to ambush the other archer and then take out the strong snake to gain the Snake Herbalist Spirit. 

Going directly through the archway leads to yet another gate and the Shrine to the next main area, so first head right under the large tree trunk platform above. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Wukong_PurpleCloud_9.jpg)

You'll find another Lushleaf among the bushes here by a Tree Pearl, with multiple pathways ahead. Going directly ahead leads to yet another Shrine, but be sure to look to the right first near the large pond where you first entered to find a larger empowered Lushleaf. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d2/Wukong_PurpleCloud_10.jpg)

As you might expect, this one will take a lot longer to kill with its strengthened spirit, so expend your big hits and spirit attacks, making sure to stop and take out whatever minions he summons. When he finally falls, you'll get the Verdant Glow Spirit, which allows you to heal rather than invoke an attack. 

Be sure to also look at the normal tree near where the Lushleaf was meditating. It has a **Luojia Fragrant Vine** wrapped around it that you can claim. 

## Bounds of Deity's Abode

![Wukong PurpleCloud 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/82/Wukong_PurpleCloud_11.jpg)

Look for a path to the left to where a small archway gate is guarded by a lone Snake Herbalist, and past it you'll find a Shrine. 

A very tough boss awaits you just up the path, so this is a good time to make sure you're properly stocked up on supplies have and crafted or upgraded (and make use of the Shrine's store to buy extra anti-miasma powder!). 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/df/Wukong_PurpleCloud_12.jpg)

When you head up the stairway path, you'll spot a large open area with a small building along the cliffside, and a large yaoguai lounging on the roof and grumbling to himself. As you approach, he'll tell you to get lost and leave him to his drink, so if you're spoiling for a fight, smack one of the pots on the ground, and he'll come leaping down for some action. 

## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - The Scorpionlord

Though he's not the final boss of Purple Cloud Mountain, the Scorpionlord is as tough as they come, owing to the massive amount of damage he can perform with either his giant claw or venomous tail. You'll need a a lot of armor to withstand his hits, and plenty of poison defense to boot, which means using the Gall Soak, and poison-resistant curios to help you out. 

If you recall your fights with the three Scorpion Princes in the Webbed Hollow, you may find more than a few of the Scorpionlord's attacks familiar, but don't be lulled into thinking you have him figured out: all of his moves strike faster, hit harder, and will evolve into longer combos as the fight drags on. Much of this fight will be learning his basic combos early, but being ready to adapt when he tricks you with extended attacks when you may otherwise think you have an opening. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/84/Wukong_PurpleCloud_13.jpg)

While your initial fight will start with him crouching down before launching a very long piercing tail strike, all subsequent attempts will begin with him whirling away from you, only to leap toward you fairly fast. 

Just like the Scorpion Prince, he'll slash at you with his claw while still airborne in front of you, but quickly follow up with a tailswipe to quickly spin about, letting him slam down with his claw for a third hit. As you can see, he'll be very tricky in alternating between his claw and tail, and you'll only have a second to see either appendage glow to know where his attack is coming from and react. 

On the plus side, you can deflect his initial lunge with a Rock Solid Deflection, but be wary when using Immobilize, as he's prone to escaping faster than other bosses, so you'll need to follow with a strong hit or risk him breaking out to resume his combo attacks. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8d/Wukong_PurpleCloud_17.jpg)

Do note that later on in the fight, he can bait you with this attack by whirling away and starting to leap, but extending his tail far head instead to stab you! 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a1/Wukong_PurpleCloud_14.jpg)

Another move he often follows up his initial combo with will start when you see him roll forward on the ground. He'll start rapidly spinning to send his tail whirling along the ground with him three times in quick succession, before rising up and slashing upward with his tail as he does. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/ba/Wukong_PurpleCloud_16.jpg)

You may also remember the claw charge used by the Scorpion Princes, as the Scorpionlord will also drag his claw along the ground and drive forward with it. If you react quickly, you can deflect it early to stop his rampage, but later on your Rock Solid won't be enough to stop you from getting knocked back. If you don't stop it early, he'll usually charge past, pivot, and whip his tail to prevent you retaliating. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a5/Wukong_PurpleCloud_15.jpg)

If you spot the boss leaping upward into the air, assume he's likely to slam down with his tail with surprising range. He can do this twice while twisting his body to the side, but later on he'll add a delayed final strike as he moves into a frontal flip. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bd/Wukong_PurpleCloud_20.jpg)

However, his most devastating attack is the one the snake woman warned you of: The Deathsting. Your only warning his when his tail stands straight up behind him and begins to glow white. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Wukong_PurpleCloud_21.jpg)

He'll then launch into a series of quick and relentless tail swipes, starting with an upward slash, a downward slam, followed by a quick low sweep, and then a final extremely damaging thrust from behind his back. The timing of these strikes can be challenging to time correctly, and he'll punctuate three of the four strikes as he shouts "Taste my... deathsting!" Due to how powerful this move is, you'll need to practice timing your dodges perfectly to avoid getting hit and poisoned by his strikes. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/43/Wukong_PurpleCloud_23.jpg)

Once you've dealt a fair amount of damage, he can also drive his tail deep into the ground. Poison will start welling up in multiple spots all around you, and explode with small geysers after a moment. The area is quite large, and you may want to quickly swap to the Pillar Stance to avoid the explosions and retaliate quickly with a charged hit. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5e/Wukong_PurpleCloud_19.jpg)

He can also run toward you and dive into the ground, forcing you to lose your lock on as he waits below ground for a moment before busting out to attack as he erupts forth. Don't get greedy after he appears, as he will usually follow his re-entry with a quick tail swipe that can turn into a grab if it connects, and immediately inject a large dose of poison into you while also dealing massive damage. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/04/Wukong_PurpleCloud_18.jpg)

You'll also need to be ready to deal with a variety of claw swipes he can employ: Some come in two slow slashes as he staggers about, while another comes in a series of quick downward slams before he pauses for one final slam that can throw off your timing. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/50/Wukong_PurpleCloud_22.jpg)

If everything mentioned already wasn't bad enough to deal with, things will only get harder the more damage you deal. Many of his attacks will gain extended combos, making it harder to predict when you'll next get a chance to get some damage in. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2d/Wukong_PurpleCloud_25.jpg)

Expect him to add somersault flips with tail strikes or behind his back stabs into many of his combos at the very end, or immediately reset after his deathsting attack to start a new attack. In addition, many of his sting attacks that leaves poison along the ground will also erupt with geysers after a moment, requiring you to stay well away from the path of these attacks. 

Finding openings can be difficult, especially when Immobilize doesn't last long and deflecting anything but his more standard claw hits will just send you tumbling back. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7c/Wukong_PurpleCloud_26.jpg)

Luckily, you can bank a powerful Spirit Attack to stagger him on cue, or bank a few focus points to knock him out of certain attacks before he can start up. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bf/Wukong_PurpleCloud_24.jpg)

You may also want to invest in using Transformation Spells like Hoarfrost or Umbral Abyss to try freezing him which can slow him down and open him up to more hits. 

Expect the fight to take a lot of practice, as one wrong step can easily remove a ton of health or leave you poisoned, and you may not survive the time it takes to cure it. Once the fearsome foe is finally defeated, you'll gain a wealth of treasures, including a Stained Jade Gourd, Sky-Piercing Horn, and Deathstinger Material to complete finally complete the Insect Armor Set. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5e/Wukong_PurpleCloud_27.jpg)

You can also now loot the **Treasure Chest** he was guarding, though it may only contain a rare consumable like a single Loong Aura Amplification Pellet. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b6/Wukong_PurpleCloud_28.jpg)

Exit the area through the top path, and note that you can find a slope up to a second peak, which has a few green Wisps to absorb, and a Dragonfly Guai guarding a rope bridge. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/58/Wukong_PurpleCloud_29.jpg)

At the end of the rope bridge, the central peak has the final **Meditation Spot** you can interact with to gain a free Skill Point. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/85/Wukong_PurpleCloud_30.jpg)

With all the major points covered, return back down to the area below, where you'll find a lone Daoist guarding a small pavilion. Look for a tiny **Treasure Chest** box on the table, and you can grab a **Celestial Registry Tablet Curio**. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/09/Wukong_PurpleCloud_31.jpg)

Now you can return to the archway guarded by two Spear Daoists on the far left side of this area, and behind them you'll find the Shrine for the next area. 

## Petalfall Hamlet

![Wukong PurpleCloud 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a8/Wukong_PurpleCloud_32.jpg)

After resting at the Petalfall Hamlet Shrine, head up the path and across a small bridge to enter the small village. It's now overrun by various Daoists, which shouldn't prove too much of a problem if you take them out one at a time. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6f/Wukong_PurpleCloud_33.jpg)

However, after climbing some stairs, you'll come across a special Sword Daoist playing a flute, and does not appear hostile. He'll actually ask a favor of you, noting that his fellow Daoists have all been partaking of Amourworm eggs, turning them into undying husks. He'll ask you to seek one out and return it to him. 

While it may sound like he's asking you to seek out a Worm Practitioner, in reality any of the Daoists you defeat in this hamlet has a chance to drop the item he seeks. We'll clear the village out before returning to him, but you may also need to rest and respawn them if you don't find one. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5a/Wukong_PurpleCloud_34.jpg)

Be sure to absorb the green Wisp in the building behind him, and then check the opposite path for two Daoists in front of a small house, and guard a **Treasure Chest** with random materials. The path around the back leads to a Fungiman, as well as the other end of the hamlet, but we have another path to take. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e6/Wukong_PurpleCloud_35.jpg)

There's a lengthy moat nearby leading under a bridge, but aside from several Croaky enemies and some green Wisps, you can't exit out the other side. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/06/Wukong_PurpleCloud_36.jpg)

Near the man who gave you the quest, there's a large stone wall with an entrance through it, but be sure and turn left as you pass through to find stairs leading up to a high ledge. Here you'll find several pots -- one of which glows and holds an **Awaken Wine Worm** inside! 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Wukong_PurpleCloud_37.jpg)

Past the wall, you'll find the moat ahead with a Daoist in front of a shack to the right, and an overgrown path to the left leading onward. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8c/Wukong_PurpleCloud_38.jpg)

Be sure to check the shacks on the right for a narrow bridge lined with green Wisps you can cross, and on the other side you'll find a **Treasure Chest** in an open building, and a pathway leading up to that other end of the hamlet. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/08/Wukong_PurpleCloud_39.jpg)

Return back across the bridge first, and make your way through the overgrown path to cross a bridge. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/45/Wukong_PurpleCloud_40.jpg)

A bigger building sits here with a Spear Daoist guarding the entrance to an inner courtyard. Inside, beware of Spider Puppets, making sure both are dealt with before going for the **Treasure Chest** at the far side. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/80/Wukong_PurpleCloud_41.jpg)

Back outside, head through the webbed trail up the sloping path first to a home with more Daoists and Puppet Spiders guarding the area, and then drop down to the lower ledge. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c9/Wukong_PurpleCloud_42.jpg)

Off to the left, you can find the Shrine for the peak, but first, head to the right for a lower path leading to a home with a Spear Daoist guarding another **Treasure Chest** out front, plus a green Wisp hovering over this side of the broken stone bridge. 

Warning - Do not head up to the peak and confront the final boss of this area, as you'll ruin the questline in progress!

![Wukong PurpleCloud 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d9/Wukong_PurpleCloud_43.jpg)

Return to the Shrine, and this time head directly right through a narrow alley into a large open courtyard area. Several Daoists wait for you here, as well as a Spider Puppet in the tree above. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 45.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7f/Wukong_PurpleCloud_45.jpg)

Once they've been defeated, look for the gate that connects back to the previously mentioned path leading back to the start of the hamlet, and you'll find a small **Treasure Chest** box inside the gate that holds the Life-Saving Pill Formula you can add to your collection! 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 44.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7e/Wukong_PurpleCloud_44.jpg)

By now, hopefully one of the Daoists you defeated will have dropped a special Key Item: The Violet Hail that is the egg the strange man asked you for. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 46.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fb/Wukong_PurpleCloud_46.jpg)

However, once you return it to him, he'll reveal that he want the egg's power all to himself, and is willing to kill for it. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Daoist Mi

The Daoist Mi is a stronger version of the Sword Daoists you've encountered all over the Temple of Yellow Flowers. Despite being stronger, he's still kind of a pushover, as he doesn't boast much more than your average enemy, even with two distinct phases. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 48.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/33/Wukong_PurpleCloud_48.jpg)

In his first phase, the Daoist Mi will come at you with flowing sword attacks, some of which can emit projectiles waves of force at range when they perform an upward slash in a reverse grip stance. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 47.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/aa/Wukong_PurpleCloud_47.jpg)

While most of their basic attacks are simple two-hit strikes, they can also start a combo with an upward slice creating a projectile wave, dash forward into a lunging strike, before spinning to perform a horizontal sweep with one last projectile wave. 

The good news all of their attacks can be deflected with Rock Solid, and pretty much any spell you have will be effective or stagger them greatly. Just treat them as you would any other Sword Daoist, keeping in mind that their greatly expanded health pool should dissuade you from pressing your attack too long so that you can back off to evade their next moves and regain your stamina. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 49.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a1/Wukong_PurpleCloud_49.jpg)

Somewhat surprisingly, Daoist Mi can also employ the move used by the Red-Haired Yaksha of Chapter 3, performing two quick fist strikes, and then turning around to perform a reverse bicycle kick that can hit especially hard -- but its still nothing as dangerous as the Scorpionlord. 

Once you deplete their health bar, the Daoist Mi will invoke the power of the worm's egg, transforming into a Worm Practitioner for the second phase of this fight. Like before, much of their attack patterns will follow the basic enemy, so there won't be too much of a surprise in store. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 50.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ae/Wukong_PurpleCloud_50.jpg)

Much of the worm's moves rely on stumbling and staggering slashes with their long poisonous appendage, either thrusting forward or dragging it along the ground toward you. While they can be a little unpredictable, they still move very slowly. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 51.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/92/Wukong_PurpleCloud_51.jpg)

The one big new move that Daoist Mi can use in this form is spewing a lot more poison across the arena. In particular, if they arch backwards for a long moment before getting up, they'll run towards you while spewing poison in every possible direction. Knowing this in advance, simply keep your distance or prepare a charged thrust attack to repel them. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 52.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5e/Wukong_PurpleCloud_52.jpg)

With Antimiasma powder on hand, the Daoist Mi won't last long against your superior skills. When you finally defeat him, the snake woman will appear and take the egg back from the fallen Daoist, before giving it to you, in the hopes you can make true use of its power. You'll gain the **Violet Hail Transformation Spell** , allowing you to temporarily turn into a Worm Practitioner yourself and become immune to poison! 

## Cloudnest Peak

As the Daoist Mi falls, the snake woman will beg you to defeat the creature that lies at the peak. Return through the hamlet to rest at the Cloudnest Peak Shrine, and ready yourself to take on the final boss of this area. 

Warning - if you haven't already, be sure you have already defeated The Scorpionlord and Daoist Mi, as defeating the final boss of this secret area may cause them to disappear!

Head up the stairs lined with peculiar statues, and enter the large arena at the base of the peak. As you do, something corrupted will emerge from the fleshy mass covering the peak, and you'll find yourself locked in combat with the horror known as The Duskveil. 

## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - The Duskveil

The Duskveil is a disfigured and undead creature that -- despite its strange appearance -- behaves like an overgrown rooster, using a variety of stomping or charge attacks, in addition to being able to fly up and out of reach. Though the boss has two phases, you may not have as much trouble as you did with The Scorpionlord, since you won't have to deal with poison, and their attacks are a bit easier to read and counter. Strangely enough, it also starts the fight at around 75% of its health, but it does have a second health bar waiting, so pacing yourself can be the key to this fight. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 54.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/09/Wukong_PurpleCloud_54.jpg)

Some of The Duskveils attacks can seem unconventional, but once you understand their moves, avoiding them will get easier. At range, they can leap into the air and unsuccessfully flap their wings as they kick out their legs, only to slam down on the ground, and then roll wildly. This means you'll need to either dodge immediately if they are in range, or wait to dodge when they roll. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 57.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cc/Wukong_PurpleCloud_57.jpg)

They can also extend white protrusions from their wings at range, and send a row of projectiles toward you. Luckily, these are easy to both dodge through or simply deflect with a quick staff spin, and since the boss performs it at range, you don't need to be wary of quick follow-up attack. 

When you close the distance, The Duskveil has a few different stomps and arm sweeps it can perform, but the variations aren't too much to worry about: 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 55.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/42/Wukong_PurpleCloud_55.jpg)

If it raises its right hoof, be prepared for a quick slam, after which it can either flap away quickly to retreat from any counters you might have in mind, or it will rear back its head and -- after a short delay -- slam it into the ground. The latter will give you more time to retaliate, and both of these moves can be deflected. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 58.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/15/Wukong_PurpleCloud_58.jpg)

The Duskveil can also raise its hoof up while pivoting slightly, in which case it will perform a swift kick instead that drags along the ground. It will follow with two slow sweeps of its arms in both directions that need only be dodged once each, or you can use Rock Solid to knock it back. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 56.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5b/Wukong_PurpleCloud_56.jpg)

One quick nasty attack to watch out for is if you spot The Duskveil pivot to hide its left arm behind its body, it will launch a very quick jab with that arm, but the good news is that it won't follow up this attack with any others. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 61.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9a/Wukong_PurpleCloud_61.jpg)

In addition to its various sweeping arm attacks, it can also take to the air for a different kind of attack, twisting its body into a spinning strike that hits multiple times (but only needs to be dodged once). It will stay in the air and flap up, holding its position for a long moment before slamming down with a single hoof for one final strike. The timing can take some getting used to, but with practice you can avoid it regularly and then retaliate as it pauses for a moment. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 59.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f0/Wukong_PurpleCloud_59.jpg)

Finally, the Duskveil can also performing a dashing charge attack, running past you back and forth like a bull up to four times. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 60.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d1/Wukong_PurpleCloud_60.jpg)

These charges can be deflected or dodged, and after the fourth charge he'll stumble to the ground where you'll have a big chance to unleash some damage. 

When you deplete its health bar, a new phase will begin as a Blood Moon pierces the sky, making things look especially eerie. In reality, not too much will change for this second phase, except some bold new moves where The Duskveil pulls out a skeletal sword from its own mouth! 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 62.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8f/Wukong_PurpleCloud_62.jpg)

There are quite a few ways The Duskveil can utilize his sword, and it's important to note that after each of these combo attacks, the sword will disappear, meaning he has to pull it out each time he starts an attack with it, which has a very visible animation (though there are a few times when its much harder to see coming). 

When he pulls his sword out of his mouth at range, he'll quickly launch into one of two attacks: 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 65.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8a/Wukong_PurpleCloud_65.jpg)

One will be a series of projectiles slashes as he spins about, sending one horizontal projectiles followed by a cross slash projectile. He'll then take to the air and slam down with his sword for a third and final strike. 

If he's at a middle distance, he's much more likely to perform the same spin attack, only extending his blade instead to slash at you physically with two quick spinning slashes, and then taking to the air. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 66.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c9/Wukong_PurpleCloud_66.jpg)

Unlike the other attack, he'll throw down his sword at you, embedding it into the ground before he lands on top of it. After a brief pause, he'll raise one hoof up, and slam down on the sword, creating a massive tremor all around. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 67.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/eb/Wukong_PurpleCloud_67.jpg)

Luckily, the moment he lands you can swap into a pillar stance and charge up to avoid the attack and retaliate with a strong charged hit. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 63.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5b/Wukong_PurpleCloud_63.jpg)

The Duskveil has a few more ways of forming his sword, and are much harder to see coming. These often happen when he sprays a damaging blood mist in front of him, obscuring him from view -- which means retreating backward can be a wise decision if you want to play it safe. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 64.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/10/Wukong_PurpleCloud_64.jpg)

From the mist, he can either launch into his quick single arm jab, or his new attack where he coughs out his sword from his mouth to stab through the mist and into the ground in front of him. 

After grabbing the sword, he'll jump back, and launch a series of projectiles slashes you'll need to dodge one at a time. Luckily, they are evenly spaced, and the timing isn't hard to get down. 

You'll also find that more than a few of his regular combos from the first phase have been amplified and require further defensive actions. His arm sweeps for example can now extend into The Duskveil quickly pulling out his sword into two sweeping spin attacks, and blend into the other combo where he throws his sword into the ground. 

His fluttering jump slam can now be extended as he flies back up to slam down a second time, then takes to the air again to pull his sword out to dive at you with a sweeping slice, and then a final aerial attack to stab his sword into the ground. 

While his projectile bones unleashed from his arm now come in two waves instead of one, he has a much more dangerous projectile attack that happens when he makes a very loud crowing noise. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 68.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/24/Wukong_PurpleCloud_68.jpg)

He'll leap backward after this, sprouting a lot more bony projectiles to throw at you in a concentrated burst. Like before, they can be dodged or even deflected with your staff spin (but they will eat up a lot of stamina). 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 69.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/94/Wukong_PurpleCloud_69.jpg)

He will immediately follow this by taking to the air, and launching a string of projectiles that arc across the air to hit you in salvos. If you're already low on stamina from deflecting the first attack, you're better off running to the side to avoid them. 

The good news is that his loud crow leaves enough time for you to interrupt the attack entirely by hitting him with a charged attack or Spirit Attack, cancelling the move entirely. 

Once you know where and when his sword will appear, the rest of the fight will come down to waiting for openings after his big attack to hit him hard, using your Spirit Attacks and Transformation Spells in this phase to speed things up. With all of his attacks being fairly visible to spot coming, it shouldn't take too long to get the hang of and send this demon rooster to the abyss. 

![Wukong PurpleCloud 70.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ae/Wukong_PurpleCloud_70.jpg)

After the Yaoguai King falls, Hong Yi the snake woman will appear to thank you for your part in putting The Duskveil to rest. The broken needle you pull out of Zhu Bajie will appear -- much to the surprise of Hong Yi -- who will offer to repair it, and grant you the **Weaver's Needle Vessel**. 

This new Vessel can aid you greatly in defeating the final boss of Chapter 4's Temple of Yellow Flowers. You'll also gain a **Double-Combed Rooster Blood Soak** for your Gourd, and both Kun Steel and The Duskveil's Horn, which will finally allow you to complete both the Iron-Tough Armor Set, and craft the Golden Loong Staff!
