Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out. 

## Black Myth: Wukong Virtuous Bamboo Engraving Location

The Virtuous Bamboo Engraving Curios item can be found randomly by defeating Snake Heads enemies in The Webbed Hollow. The best spot to farm it is at the Temple of Yellow Flowers entrance.
