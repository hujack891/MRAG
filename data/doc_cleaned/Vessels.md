# Vessels

Vessels in Black Myth: Wukong are a unique piece of equipment that offers both a passive and active ability when equipped. They are exceptionally strong and should be used when facing off against bosses or when you are in a spot of trouble during a fight. These Vessels are rare, and you will have to go out of your way to find them. 

The passive ability usually provides a general stat boost in an area, while the active ability can be activated to provide a much stronger buff that can change the tide of a fight.
