# Curios

Curios in Black Myth: Wukong act as accessories, equipment you can equip to boost your stats or unlock new buffs. Most of these can be found in boxes throughout the game's chapters. However, some are dropped by bosses or unlocked in other, more unique ways. 

These buffs range from minor, small boosts to more significant upgrades that are vital to your survival and taking on the tougher bosses hidden in the game.
