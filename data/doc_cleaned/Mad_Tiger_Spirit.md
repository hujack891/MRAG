## Mad Tiger Location

The Mad Tiger is waiting at the bottom of a well in Yellow Wind Ridge, but reaching it is quite the process. To begin the Mad Tiger quest, you must first defeat the Tiger's Acolyte and collect his Spirit along with an item called the Old Rattle Drum.

You will need to find three areas across Yellow Wind Ridge where you can use the drum to summon a spirit. The only clue you’ll have is that entering the correct area will cause your vision to warp, and you will hear the ghostly voice of a boy calling out to you.

  * The first location is further back in the Windrest Hamlet. Return across the bridge to the Windrest Hamlet Shrine and pass back through the large gate, immediately taking a left to the large house surrounded by sitting Withering Corpses.

  * The second location is on the path down from the sealed stone door where you fought the King of Flowing Sand and the Second Rat Prince. Head down from the door towards a bridge and take a right to pass through a ruined building overhang where there’s a long roof-like walkway and several Withering Corpses milling about.

  * The final location is back in the area where you fought the Earth Wolf and rescued the Horse Guai who was tied up by the large statue in Sandgate Village. Look to the left of that statue altar, and you’ll find a small field around the back with a concerning amount of skeletons and a well.

Using the Rattle-Drum here one final time will cause the spirit of the boy to appear before you, and invite you to hop down the well to meet a “friend”. Unfortunately, if the dull echoing roars coming from somewhere below are any indication, you’re not going to meet a friendly face down there. 

## Mad Tiger Fight

The Mad Tiger is an extremely aggressive fighter with a plethora of moves ranging from punch combos, swipes, and leaps resulting in earth-shattering landings, rock showers, roars strong enough to knock you off your feet, and even a move where the boss picks up a massive boulder to obliterate you with. The Mad Tiger is a large enemy but extremely agile. **The key to this fight is Perfect Dodging.**

Most swipe and punch moves are delivered in threes, often followed by a leap where the Mad Tiger soars into the air to crash back down on you. You will get a brief moment of reprieve when he lands to cast Immobilize, giving you time to land your own combo before he leaps back into action and you have to get back on the defensive.

Some bosses in Black Myth: Wukong can be handled with pure aggression, but this is not one of them. Choosing your moments wisely is imperative in this fight, and try not to get greedy. If you've got one hit left in your combo, but the boss is recovering, leave it. Retreat and attack again once the Mad Tiger is done with its next combo. 

Stock up on all medicines before heading into the fight to boost your stats, and don't hold back on your spells because the Mad Tiger certainly isn't going to hold back on you!

  * **Boulder Smash**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases Attack, but massively reduces Maximum Health. 

The Mad Tiger's Spirit allows you to take the form of the tiger and release an earth-shattering roar that deals damage and causes nearby enemies to fly backward. This is an excellent move to pull out if you're getting overwhelmed and need a bit of space on the battlefield but also want to deal some damage while you're getting it. 

The equipped effect is an all-or-nothing sort of deal that isn't for the faint of heart. It moderately increases your Attack at the expense of a massive chunk of your Health. This effect is situational, and its success depends on your ability to avoid damage. Thankfully, you will have had plenty of practice with Perfect Dodging after defeating the Mad Tiger.
