## Non-Void Location

Non-Void is the most difficult Non-Enemy to find and is part of his own side quest. At the end of Chapter 2, you will be told a story about a man who saved a dying fox. The man had a dream that the fox attacked his family one night and killed the fox upon waking for fear that the dream may become a reality. 

While exploring the New West, you will come across a corpse slumped over at a gate. Interact with the corpse to get a mission from the fox. She wants you to take her to the man who took her life. The man in question is Non-Void, and he can be found on the left wing of the New Thunderclap Temple complex.

To get there, head to the New Thunderclap Temple and pass through the entrance. Head straight ahead through the second building and take the stairs on the left. Keep heading left and into the red building on the side. Run up the stairs on the right, around the veranda, and up the stairs at the back to find yourself in the left-wing courtyard. Run up the stone stairs to find Non-Void waiting in the temple. 

If you get hit as the fox you will transform back into the monkey. Use the Snow Fox Brush to turn back into the fox again before entering the temple to complete her quest. The brush will be in your inventory after initiating the quest.

## Non-Void Fight

Non-Void doesn't fight with a weapon, preferring to use spells to deal damage to his foes. Non-Void can wield invisibility spells that shroud his form, leaving you only able to see his outline. He is invincible in this form. Non-Void can also scoop up the pages covering the floor of the temple and create a swirling vortex that deals damage if you get caught in it. Perfect Dodge before the paper cloud consumes you to avoid the myriad of paper cuts Non-Void wants to inflict on you.

  * **Flash Step**
  * Equipped Effect: Recovers a moderate amount of Stamina when being hit. 

Non-Void's Spirit Power allows you to take his form and use the invisibility move he wields in combat. You are invincible when invisible, so you can use the move to escape any pickle you might find yourself in. The equipped effect Non-Void offers allows you to recover Stamina when taking damage, making him a more defensive Spirit.
