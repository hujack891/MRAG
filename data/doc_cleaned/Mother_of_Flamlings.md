# Mother of Flamlings

Mother of Flamlings one of the optional Yaoguai Chief boss fights Chapter 5 in Black Myth: Wukong. You'll need to summon her with Fire Ore to make her appear, then you're in for a fight against her and her Flamlings.

Take the path that slopes down behind the area where you fought the Flint Vanguard. You'll encounter some more of the Searing and Scorching-Flame enemies, as well as a little green Wisp to the right, by the lava lake.

As you head into the next barren section, you may notice the glow of a treasure chest up ahead. Be warned that there are also little glowing patches leading up to, and inside the next clearing, and these are all Flamlings. Clear them out before you go over to the chest, where you can collect Refined Iron Sand from it. 

When you've looted the chest, go around to the other side of the rock. There will be an open clearing here, that looks like it's empty. Again, remove any Flamlings from the area, then go to the center of the clearing. Here you'll find a larger glowing patch.

This is actually where you can summon a miniboss called the Mother of Flamlings, and to do so, all you need to give over is 4x Flame Ores. Thankfully, Flame Ores are dropped by Flamlings, so you'll hopefully have enough by this point to summon her immediately. Approach the glowing patch and deliver the Flame Ores.

The ground will rumble as the Mother of Flamlings appears, and fireballs will be thrown out as soon as she bursts through the ground. Stand back after delivering the Flame Ores to avoid this attack.

These will land on the ground and turn into glowing patches. Unfortunately, these will become Flamlings, so be mindful of these as you run around the arena.

The Mother of Flamlings, thankfully, won't move. She'll stay where she is and use ranged fireball attacks, very similar to the Flamlings. To combat this, get as close to her as possible and try to land a few attacks. The downside of this, however, is that she will try to whip you with her body. If you can dodge these, she'll smack herself into the ground and be temporarily stunned.

After hitting her a few times, she'll be frustrated and scream. This is when the Flamlings will emerge and begin to shoot fireballs immediately. You'll want to clear these out as fast as you can and use your Fireproof Mantle and Body-Cooling Powder to counter any fire damage you might experience. 

When you've cleared out the first round of Flamlings, she'll reappear. This round of attacks will repeat until she's been defeated, except she can reappear when Flamlings are still in the arena after the first round. Still, the priority should be to remove them first before focusing on her. 

After the Mother of Flamlings fight, pick up the Mother of Flamlings Spirit and then continue on the path down the Cooling Slope.
