# New Thunderclap Temple Walkthrough

The New Thunderclap Temple is the final main region of Chapter 3 in The New West in Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide for the New Thunderclap Temple Region, including how to navigate the temple, complete the Snow Fox Questline and defeat all of Yellowbrow's disciples, and finally face Yellowbrow himself.

Now that you've made your way through the Valley of Ecstasy (and hopefully accepted the Snow Fox's request in the Forest of Felicity), the grand New Thunderclap Temple awaits. 

The temple is a sprawling complex teeming with Yellowbrow's minions, and is comprised of three main plazas leading to the large pagoda tower in the distance, with additional and optional areas on both sides as you make your way up. 

## Temple Entrance

![Wukong Thunderclap 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ae/Wukong_Thunderclap_1.jpg)

With Captain Kalpa-Wave defeated, you can head through the temple entrance to find the Temple Entrance Shrine to the left. There's a large entry courtyard area here, with another gate straight ahead, and some optional spots to explore on both sides. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e1/Wukong_Thunderclap_2.jpg)

Be sure to turn around from the Shrine and look back toward the main gate, and you should spot a **Treasure Chest** to the right in front of an altar. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/36/Wukong_Thunderclap_3.jpg)

From the chest, be sure to keep exploring this side a bit farther to find a frozen lake and falls where a number of Censor Holders are wandering around while a lesser Sea Monk watches over them. Remember to watch out for their snow boulder tossing and rapidly extending appendages to find a moment to dodge around strike at them. 

Once defeated, you can check the statues by the frozen falls to find a green Wisp to absorb. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a1/Wukong_Thunderclap_4.jpg)

The central path from the Shrine leads down a main road with more Censor Holders on both sides (they won't bother you if you don't bother them) leading to a large building guarded by a Dual-Blade Monk. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/af/Wukong_Thunderclap_5.jpg)

Before checking the interior, be sure to look around the left side of the building to find a Thunder Rhino Master on top of a small wooden platform, and climb the snowdrift on the side to reach him before he can cast lightning on you. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ae/Wukong_Thunderclap_7.jpg)

Behind the mage, you can spot a new enemy standing by a sealed doorway. These Overseeing Monks are an interesting enemy - they really are blind, and will often shift about when they sense you approach. However, once you attack, they'll immediately begin to counter with powerful martial arts, which can sometimes extend for several powerful attacks in a row. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/99/Wukong_Thunderclap_6.jpg)

The good news is that they largely remain stationary, meaning you can easily stop a few feet away and charge a full heavy thrust attack to knock them flat, and then follow up with a quick light combo as they stagger to their feet. 

Once this monk has been defeated, check the corner of this snowdrift for a green Wisp to absorb. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/53/Wukong_Thunderclap_8.jpg)

Inside the building itself, you'll find another Overseeing Monk in the main room (plus another on the far right side of the building exterior), and on the other side is the beginning of the main plaza, but the stairs beyond are lined with several Thunder Rhino Masters, so let's backtrack and find an optional side path. 

Back at the Temple Entrance Shrine, move to the right to find two other paths: 

![Wukong Thunderclap 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/94/Wukong_Thunderclap_9.jpg)

Take the first left to find a quicker path to the Main Plaza that's a little less guarded, as there's only a Supporter Monk patrolling the path to where a lone Overseeing Monk guarding a smaller gate. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d4/Wukong_Thunderclap_10.jpg)

If you take the far right path, you can find another green Wisp in the farthest corner close to the entrance gate, and another path leading to a side area. 

Take out a lone Censor Holder as you follow the stone path to a long sloping corridor with a green Wisp to absorb at the bottom. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6b/Wukong_Thunderclap_11.jpg)

The sloping path itself is lined with several Supporter Monks, but are thankfully slow to attack and allow you to charge up your focus points with light combos and unleash big hits before they can react. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/97/Wukong_Thunderclap_12.jpg)

At the top of the slope, two Censor Holders and a Supporter Monk are praying to statues of Turtle and Snake General, and you can ignore them or unleash a surprise attack if you wish. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/71/Wukong_Thunderclap_14.jpg)  
By now you may have noticed the New Thunderclap Temple is brimming with lots of enemies you don't necessarily need to kill. Between the praying Censor Holders and blind Overseeing Monks, you can ignore a lot of enemies if you wish, but it's also not a bad idea to kill them for extra Will and Experience, and is also a good way to build up Focus to expend on more deadly foes. 

Head into the next area, and look left at the top of the stairs to find another Turtle General statue with a **Treasure Chest** with a Knot of Voidness and other materials, surrounded on all sides by praying Censor Holders. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1a/Wukong_Thunderclap_13.jpg)

Be wary of two Supporter Monks lying in wait in opposite alcoves near the statue, as well as the patrolling monk on the nearby road. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/47/Wukong_Thunderclap_15.jpg)

There's more Censor Holders praying in front of an altar that stands before a gate opening, but you can also continue to explore the far corner to find a Wolf Guardian by a tree, and a green Wisp to absorb at the top of a snow drift nearby. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/22/Wukong_Thunderclap_16.jpg)

Finally, look to the right when approaching the gate to find a small side room with an alcove to the right where a **Treasure Chest** with materials has been stashed. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/06/Wukong_Thunderclap_17.jpg)

Inside the side room, there's another large tree that a Supporter Monk is facing, but a Wolf Guardian will try to ambush you as you approach him. You can also find a Ginsengling around the tree roots by trying to harvest some Aged Ginseng. 

Carefully head through the open doorway into the side plaza, and look for a small alcove on the left for a green Wisp to absorb. However, once you begin to explore this area, a Yaoguai Chief will emerge from a nearby altar. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Monk from the Sea

The Monk from the Sea is essentially a supercharged version of the already tough Sea Monks you've been encountering since escaping the Pagoda Realm's prison. While you may recognize a good number of his moves, you'll soon find that he's also been infused with a lot of frost power, and can quickly chill and render you immobile before dealing a killing blow. As such, having chill-resistant items and curios will be of great help here. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/ce/Wukong_Thunderclap_18.jpg)

By now you're well aware of this Monk's ability to use their tentacles to strike at you form a distance, both in a three-hit combos to stab outward, or in spinning horizontal sweeps. By recognizing the timing, you can make good use of deflecting these attacks or immobilizing him mid swing. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f5/Wukong_Thunderclap_21.jpg)

In addition to his large snowy boulder throw for massive damage, he can also toss two smaller rocks when at a far distance, but they deal less damage and are easier to step away from. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Wukong_Thunderclap_19.jpg)

What really makes this Yaoguai a Chief is his ability to invoke frost damage. Whenever you spot him rise up in the air on his two appendages and create a gust around him, he's actually coating the area in frost, which will quickly raise your frost meter while in the area. 

Considering how snowy the area already is, this can be quite dangerous as it's hard to tell where the affected area is. Look carefully for a low mist, or try to reposition yourself in a non snow-covered area to see when its been painted over in white. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/dc/Wukong_Thunderclap_20.jpg)

It'll take a lot of repositioning to survive this fight, and you'll also need to be aware of one other new attack that seems harmless but can deal a good amount of damage, as the Monk from the Sea can either leap toward or away from you with a deceptive blast. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/76/Wukong_Thunderclap_22.jpg)

If he uses it to jump at you, he'll use his appendages to stab down as he lands, and after a pause, will slam down to the ground that creates another damaging blast. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9a/Wukong_Thunderclap_24.jpg)

Defeating this Yaoguai Chief will boast an unexpected reward: Hoarfrost. With this, you'll be able to utilize a new Transformation Spell to become a Monk from the Sea, and inflict your own frost damage on enemies to chill them! 

Monk from the Sea

![Wukong Thunderclap 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/95/Wukong_Thunderclap_25.jpg)

Now that you've dealt with the Yaoguai Chief, you can explore this large size plaza. Up ahead, you'll find several Overseeing Monks praying to a Turtle General statue and three more practicing punching a large tree (you can sidestep them and keep on the main path if you wish since they won't notice you unless you draw close). 

![Wukong Thunderclap 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e8/Wukong_Thunderclap_26.jpg)

Head down the stairs, where you'll find another sealed building on the right guarded by an Overseeing Monk and some Thunder Rhino Masters, and several sets of stairs to the left. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ec/Wukong_Thunderclap_29.jpg)

Take the very first staircase down to a lower platform on the left with a small hut guarded by a Supporter Monk. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/78/Wukong_Thunderclap_28.jpg)

Just past him you can follow a small path to a pavilion, where you'll encounter a Wolf Guardian. Defeat him, and you'll earn a **Bronze Buddha Pendant Curio**. 

You'll also find a small turtle chest on the pavilion's table itself, and opening it will reveal the **Sweet Ice** Soak for your Gourd Drink, giving you extra chill resistance after consuming your drink. 

Before heading down the main stairs to a fearsome looking foe, head all the way around to the far stairs, which leads to another small building where two Thunder Rhino Masters overlook the enemy below. You'll want to take them out so they can't give him support. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5c/Wukong_Thunderclap_27.jpg)

After defeating these two mages, turn around and look at the side of the small red building to find a **Treasure Chest** with materials inside. 

Now you can head down the main stairs to encounter this new foe, a Clay Vajra. While he may look like a Yaoguai Chief, this is just a very formidable Yaoguai (that thankfully doesn't respawn). 

![Wukong Thunderclap 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6f/Wukong_Thunderclap_30.jpg)

The four-legged creatures can emit fire from several places -- using a large opening on its chest to emit a huge flamethrower you'll need to Immobilize to shut down or stay well away from. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d5/Wukong_Thunderclap_31.jpg)

The creatures also has little mouths on each of its kneecaps that can also emit flames, and while they don't travel as far, the monster will constantly spin around to shoot fire on all sides. 

It will often follow up these attacks by utilizing it's spear to charge forward in a thrust attack, or slam it into the ground, pivot, and pull it out again with a wide slash while also breathing fire from its knees. If you see the monster draw in power, be ready for a torrent of a fireball that will shoot your way and cannot be deflected with a staff spin, requiring you to dodge instead. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f2/Wukong_Thunderclap_32.jpg)

The large gateway at the end of this path is guarded by three Overseeing Monks, one apart from the others, but all can be lured away independently due to their short-range senses. 

## Temple Main Plaza

Heading through here will lead you to the same central plaza that can be reached from the Temple Entrance Shrine's main path, or the higher path on the right. 

Taking either side path to each this plaza leads to a large road with a few patrolling Monk Supporters and an Overseeing Monk, with two Thunder Rhino Masters guarding the main stairs upward. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1d/Wukong_Thunderclap_33.jpg)

If you check to the side of the stairs first, you can find a green Wisp to absorb in a large pot, but you'll need to watch out for a Wolf Guardian standing on a wooden platform above looking to ambush you. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1e/Wukong_Thunderclap_34.jpg)

At the top of the stairs, you can look left to find the two sets of stairs back down to the Temple Entrance's main path where four Thunder Rhino Masters have gathered -- attacking them from the back will allow you to ambush them one by one. 

It's worth noting that this area only has two real Shrines, and the other is up near the boss room past two Dark-faced Overlords. Given there's more optional bosses and enemies to face, it's not a bad idea to go back and rest at the entrance before making a beeline through the side path to return to the main plaza.

At the top of the stairs where all the mages were positioned, there's actually not too much to find here. Several Monk Supporters patrol the building exterior, where you can also find a few Overseeing Monks training along the corners. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c6/Wukong_Thunderclap_35.jpg)

The interior building hides three more Overseeing Monks and a patrolling Dual-Blade Monk, but nothing in the way of actual rewards. 

If you want to advance to the main boss, the large stairway on the other side of the building will lead you to the Inner Courtyard, but there's another optional side path to explore first, on the opposite side as the other optional path we explored earlier. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/78/Wukong_Thunderclap_36.jpg)

You can still find another Clay Vajra to battle at the foot of the main stairs. It's a tougher fight than the previous one, and you'll be rewarded for besting it with the Clay Vajra Spirit to add to your collection. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/58/Wukong_Thunderclap_38.jpg)

While looking up at the stairs leading up to the pagoda, take the path left to a side stairway going down and guarded by a Thunder Rhino Master. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b4/Wukong_Thunderclap_37.jpg)

Be sure to look to your right after defeating him, and you can spot a wooden platform beyond a tree along the walls that holds a **Treasure Chest** with materials inside. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/99/Wukong_Thunderclap_40.jpg)

Head down the stairs to reach another large building, and a long pathway in front of it. To your right is a small frozen pond under part of a bridge, where another lesser Sea Monk hides along with a green Wisp to absorb. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1b/Wukong_Thunderclap_39.jpg)

To the left of the building, there's more wooden platforms below the wall where a Wolf Guardian waits near a patrolling Supporter Monk. In the snow-filled corner of this area, you'll find more wooden platforms with another **Treasure Chest** you can loot for random materials. 

Head back to the main building and quickly dart inside to avoid the lightning strikes of the Thunder Rhino Masters on the balcony above. 

The darkened room is small, and hides another Overseeing Monk, as well as stairs leading upward to the right. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/82/Wukong_Thunderclap_41.jpg)

Beware of more Overseeing Monks as you ascend, and try to stay patient using thrust attacks from out of their range to conserve your health from getting hit by their martial arts counters. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cb/Wukong_Thunderclap_42.jpg)

Once at the top of the building, be ready for another Overseeing Monk to ambush you, and then head out to the balcony to deal with the lightning mages. 

Before heading through the doors behind the two mages, look instead for another path along the balcony leading to a large bridge. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1c/Wukong_Thunderclap_43.jpg)

Take this bridge path up to find a massive statue altar at the far end. Standing next to a pillar nearby, you'll have your third meeting with the friendly Horse Guai. It seems he's quite bewitched by Yellowbrow and has lost the will to continue his quest. 

While there's nothing you can do to resolve his dilemma (other than beat up Yellowbrow yourself), you can keep talking to him and he'll give you the **Trailblazer's Scarlet Gourd** , a new gourd bottle you can try that grants a full heal on the first swig! 

![Wukong Thunderclap 44.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/be/Wukong_Thunderclap_44.jpg)

Be sure to also inspect the small gold box at the foot of the large statue altar, and you'll get the Body-**Fleeting Powder Formula** , plus three extra powders for free that can allow you to fight without expending stamina for a short duration. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 45.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1f/Wukong_Thunderclap_45.jpg)

Head back along the bridge and through the balcony to the large doorway, and on the other side you can find a green Wisp to absorb hiding in the corner, and a small ramp leading to a large building at the top of several stone stairs. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 46.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8f/Wukong_Thunderclap_46.jpg)

Many Censor Holders pray around this area, but most will ignore you. There's also a lone Overseeing Monk praying to an altar off to the left, which holds another green Wisp to absorb. 

Once you reach the top of the stairs, you'll find a few small sealed shacks on the side with Overseeing Monks, and the main building entrance guarded by two Thunder Rhino Masters. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 47.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/20/Wukong_Thunderclap_47.jpg)

After defeating them, you can spot a lone monk standing inside. This is the target of the Snow Fox's quest for revenge, and you can now use the Snow Fox Brush in your inventory to transform into The Fox, and step inside to trigger a cutscene (if you enter first you can speak to him, but transforming near the monk will instantly trigger the fight without a scene). 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-Void

The monk who killed the Fox Guai you encountered in the Forest of Felicity, Non-Void is one of the disciples of Yellowbrow, and has his own set of peculiar moves. While he doesn't deal elemental damage, he can be a hard target to pin down due to his ability to become non-corporeal, causing some of your attacks to pass right through him! 

The key to defeating this foe is to learn his attacks, and more importantly learning which parts leave him vulnerable to counters, and when you won't able to hurt him. Whenever he becomes transparent, avoid using any moves like Immobilize as you'll just waste their cooldowns and mana. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 48.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4d/Wukong_Thunderclap_48.jpg)

Instead, watch his attacks carefully. His most basic attack will begin when he draws his arm in before lashing out with a straight jab with his long claws. Ignore the urge to retaliate, and instead wait a moment for him to follow-up with an incorporeal backhand followed by a blazing palm strike. 

You'll have two options to counter this move: by dodging the third and final strike, you can use this time to capitalize on the end of his combo with Immobilize or Spirit Attacks to send him stumbling. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 52.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/11/Wukong_Thunderclap_52.jpg)

Once you've learned the timing of his combo, you can also perform a Rock Solid Deflection on his second strike even when he's incorporeal, and the deflection will knock him backward and out of his transparent form, allowing you to press your attack. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 49.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6f/Wukong_Thunderclap_49.jpg)

If you take too long to recover and try to rush him, he's likely to fade away and warp backward while immune to damage, so only expend your focus points if you're catching him at the right time. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 50.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Wukong_Thunderclap_50.jpg)

He can also form energy around himself by moving his arms in a circle. This will cause all the scattered pages around the floor to form into a whirling tornado, which he'll send at you. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 51.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a7/Wukong_Thunderclap_51.jpg)

While it can be dodged, the paper tornado will constantly follow you, and Non-Void will use this opportunity to cast more projectiles at you. Luckily, you can actually utilize your Staff Spin to disperse the tornado. The moment you see the papers flutter back to the ground, resume your assault! 

When trying to press your attack against him, watch for one of his incorporeal evasions where he twirls around to the side of you. He'll often end this movement by preparing a large palm blast attack. Though he'll do so while still transparent, it can be deflected with Rock Solid, or evaded as he'll return to solid form after the attack ends. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 53.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8c/Wukong_Thunderclap_53.jpg)

Another attack he can perform while you engage him from the front will start when he bunches up his fists close to his body. He'll explode outward with a simultaneous punch and kick move, and then after a moment will follow up with two charging fist strikes while phased out, sending him forward several steps to pursue any backward evasions. 

Once you learn to anticipate these attacks, you'll find it easier to outmaneuver him, and look for the best opening to expend your focus points and deal the most damage (doing so when he's Immobilized is also a good guarantee). 

![Wukong Thunderclap 54.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/46/Wukong_Thunderclap_54.jpg)

Similarly, any Transformation can deal good damage here, but be sure not to expend your final attack when he's phasing out, or you'll waste it entirely. 

When Non-Void finally falls to your assault, you'll be able to absorb the Non-Void Spirit. 

### Completing the Snow Fox Questline

![Wukong Thunderclap 68.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/ca/Wukong_Thunderclap_68.jpg)  
You should make a point to return to the Forest of Felicity the next chance you get, and return to talk to the Snow Fox pelt on the corpse near the Shrine. As thanks, The Fox will give the **Snow Fox Brush Curio** , which will extend your Transformation times by a great deal! 

![Wukong Thunderclap 55.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/02/Wukong_Thunderclap_55.jpg)

Exiting Non-Void's temple room, head back down the stairs and take a left to find a large bamboo garden area. A large frozen river snakes through the middle of this area, and there are many assorted enemies to watch out for here. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 56.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/80/Wukong_Thunderclap_56.jpg)

Head along the outer path past a Supporter Monk to a far building past the frozen waterfall. You can find a small gold pot at the base of the frozen falls here, but there are two Guardian Wolves overlooking it that you'll need to lure out and take care of first. Be wary you don't pull too far back down the frozen river and alert a Thunder Rhino Master on top of some rocks. After defeating them, open the pot to find a **Celestial Nonary Pill** to increase your stamina. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 57.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4a/Wukong_Thunderclap_57.jpg)

Once you've claimed the pill, hop up the other side of the frozen river to fight the Clay Vajra. Follow the path around the frozen river past where several Censor Holders are praying before a Dual-Blade Monk, and you'll find a **Treasure Chest** in front of a large stone monument near where the frozen river leads to the bridge you ran across earlier. 

Now you can return back to the Main Plaza, and this time head up past where you defeated the other Clay Vajra for its Spirit, and enter the last part of the temple. 

## Temple Inner Courtyard

![Wukong Thunderclap 58.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/18/Wukong_Thunderclap_58.jpg)

Guarding the path to the last boss of the temple are two Dark-faced Overlords, and they won't be happy to see you. Expect at least one of them to toss a boulder at you, and you'll want to charge one as soon as possible to maximize the time you have 1v1 before the other arrives. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 59.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/49/Wukong_Thunderclap_59.jpg)

The good news is there's a Shrine at the top of the last set of stairs, and you might be able to race upward and claim it, otherwise go all out in using all of your abilities -- like Pluck of Many -- to even the odds along with Transformations. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 60.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ad/Wukong_Thunderclap_60.jpg)

Try to draw in both if using the Ashen Slumber to detonate yourself to hit them both, and keep one of the overlords between you and his friend at all times to limit how easily the far one can reach you with their swipes. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 61.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ef/Wukong_Thunderclap_61.jpg)

When they've been defeated, rest up at the Mahavira Hall Shrine, but be sure to head back down the stairs to the main floor. One side has a sealed door with a lone Thunder Rhino Master and a small pot with a green Wisp in it just to the side 

![Wukong Thunderclap 62.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/35/Wukong_Thunderclap_62.jpg)

The opposite side of the Courtyard has an open door leading to the last of Yellowbrow's disciples. 

### Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Non-Pure

Non-Pure is a very aggressive fighter, similar to Non-Able, but instead uses a large sweeping monk spade to attack in long combo swings that can be difficult to escape from. Finding opportunities to get your own attacks in can be difficult, but you'll need to resist the urge to jump in too early or you'll be hit and staggered multiple times. 

Given his long sweeping swings, having backup from A Pluck of Many or Spirits that summon other allies won't work as well as they'll tend to get hit even if he's focusing all his attention on you. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 66.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/52/Wukong_Thunderclap_66.jpg)

To make matters worse, Non-Pure also has a large gauntlet that he can periodically imbue with deflecting power, making him even harder to damage when he's not unleashing combos. Look for the glow in his glove (and especially his arm tattoo glowing bright as he's likely to hide his glove behind his back) to know when he's most likely to knock your attacks aside, and resist the urge to expend your focus points. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 67.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/70/Wukong_Thunderclap_67.jpg)

If you try attacking him when his glove is powered up two many times, he'll eventually retaliate with a counterattack, stunning you for a moment and then unleashing a spin attack that you may not be able to evade in time. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 63.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/09/Wukong_Thunderclap_63.jpg)

One of Non-Pure's most common attacks will be jogging up to you before thrusting his spade forward. A moment later, he'll perform a flourish as he twirls his body so that the weapon's shaft rests on his shoulder, and then spin his body quickly to perform a follow-up horizontal slice. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 65.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Wukong_Thunderclap_65.jpg)

Another quick two-hit combo he can employ is a quick side slice followed by an overhead slam. Since many of his combo attacks cover both vertical and horizontal hits, you can't just backpedal in one direction to evade them. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 64.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/ca/Wukong_Thunderclap_64.jpg)

When he decides to get nasty with his combos, you'll either want to learn the moves and deflect one to knock him off balance, or Immobilize to shut him down. One of his most lengthy combos will come when he sweeps his weapon upward and then back down for two rotations, and then quickly swings it back and forth three more times, before leaping up to perform one last spin attack as he lands. Without a lot of stamina in reserve, it will be tough one to evade completely. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 69.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8a/Wukong_Thunderclap_69.jpg)

This isn't all he's capable of, either. He can also run at you an let out a war cry as he swings his blade in a circle, and then chain it into a tornado of five spins, ending with a jumping slash attack that again is very hard to stay away from unless you can interrupt his attack with spells. Luckily, he'll end the attack with a long flourish, giving you time to get back at him. 

Even his single attack can deal big damage if you aren't ready for their relatively fast speed. He may feint his blade in an upward swing, before launching himself high into the air and crash down with an overhand swing. 

Watch his movements carefully to see if he goes back to his default positioning. If he comes out of the jump attack by pulling his blade around with him, he'll follow up with two spinning slashes that need to be avoided to deflected to stop him in his tracks. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 70.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f1/Wukong_Thunderclap_70.jpg)

The one thing his powered up gauntlet isn't great at deflecting is Transformation attacks -- both from Spirits and Spells. The Ashen Slumber in particular is a good bet, as the Rat Captain has a very long evasive dash, and you can breath fire on him that can't be blocked, nor can your Fiery Burst detonation. 

Time your attacks well to find the gaps in his defenses, and remember to cultivate your Spirits and upgrade your Transformation Spell abilities as needed. When Non-Pure is finally defeated, you'll be able to absorb the last disciples spirit, the Non-Pure Spirit. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 71.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c0/Wukong_Thunderclap_71.jpg)

Before leaving his boss room, be sure to look where he was initially standing to find the last **Meditation Point** in Chapter 3, and gain your free Skill Point. 

## Mahavira Hall

![Wukong Thunderclap 72.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/73/Wukong_Thunderclap_72.jpg)

Now that you've finished exploring all that Chapter 3 has to offer you currently, only the final boss awaits, and it's a bit of a gauntlet. 

After resting at the Mahavira Hall Shrine at the top of the stairs, be sure to take assessment of your gear. Cultivate your best Spirits, make sure you have a lot of pills on hand an craft a bunch of extra Shock-Quelling Powder (you're going to need it). 

You should also have any anti-shock gear/curios/soaks on hand as well, along with whatever else can keep you alive for awhile. This final encounter is spread out into three distinct fights, and while you'll be able to respawn and pick up where you left off for the first two sections from the Shrine, the final section won't take you back to the Shrine. 

When you're ready to take on the lord of New Thunderclap Temple, head through the door. 

## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Yellowbrow

No longer the small chubby monk you've seen previously, this much larger giant of a man is an incredibly dangerous and formidable foe, and uses a host of lightning attacks to try and inflict Shock status on you. Taking double damage from any of his attacks is highly inadvisable, so make sure your Shock-Quelling Powder is on your quickbar for this fight. 

Yellowbrow chiefly attacks with a large spiked mace while he holds his magic seedbag in the other hand. Be incredibly wary of his weapon, as it has the ability to change its shape, and he can extend the handle at will both in size, length, and flexibility. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 73.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a3/Wukong_Thunderclap_73.jpg)

To start, Yellowbrow will often charge up his spiked mace before thrusting it right at you, increasing its length and size with surprising reach. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 74.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/aa/Wukong_Thunderclap_74.jpg)

Expect him to follow up this attack be retracting it, and then slamming it over his head down in front of him with another ranged mid-range attack. 

These two attacks have a lot of weight to them, and leave him with considerable openings to get in plenty of hits while he retracts his weapon and resets his posture, so make the most of them! 

![Wukong Thunderclap 81.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/ba/Wukong_Thunderclap_81.jpg)

If he slams his mace straight into the ground directly in front of him with the handle up, back off and wait for him to charge it up. He'll slide it along the ground in a sweep around him, which will then send out a shockwave you'll either want to jump or Pillar Stance over (just make sure you're out of range of his sweep when you do). 

![Wukong Thunderclap 75.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7f/Wukong_Thunderclap_75.jpg)

At range, he'll often swing his mace upward several times, sending electrical currents along the ground toward you. They aren't too bad to deal with, so long as you strafe to the side as you advance and avoid their paths. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 76.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e8/Wukong_Thunderclap_76.jpg)

After fighting for a bit, Yellowbrow will often vanish into thin air, but you can get a heads up on where he's going by looking for his shadow on the ground and which direction it darts off to. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 78.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b0/Wukong_Thunderclap_78.jpg)

Early on, he'll reappear just to gloat, and if you see him raise his arms in a taunt, that's your cue to retaliate by expending your focus points to hit him hard. Three Focus Points on a Pillar Heavy Strike can often send him staggering to his knees, giving you a lot of opportunity to continue your assault. 

Just be warned that as the battle progresses, he'll come out of his vanishing act with another attack prepped, so you'll need to both find his new position (or listen for it), and react quickly. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 77.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1a/Wukong_Thunderclap_77.jpg)

When he starts to chastise you and proclaim you "insolent", watch for him to wave his mace around to create small little motes of electricity around his head. Hang back when he does this, and wait for a moment for the orbs to come racing in your direction. Use your staff spin to quickly clear them out, while being ready to dodge if Yellowbrow employs another attack. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 79.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7a/Wukong_Thunderclap_79.jpg)

As he starts getting madder, his attacks will start to have more range. Simple sweeping strikes of his mace can alter to have his weapon handle extend to bend the weapon around his back to cover a wider arc and catch you with. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 80.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6d/Wukong_Thunderclap_80.jpg)

If you see his foot rise as it crackles with electricity, you're better off staying back, as you can be knocked into the air of his stomp connects, which turns into a "grab" where he'll pierce you with his mace and slam you into the ground for a ton of damage. It's still possible to deflect the stomp with Rock Solid or rise above it with your Pillar Stance, but if you're not sure on the timing, just play it safe. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 82.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b6/Wukong_Thunderclap_82.jpg)

Once he gets to around half his health or less, be especially prepared for his ultimate attack. He'll usually begin by proclaiming that he will "meet you in combat, devoid of any relics", and charge his weapon above his head, drawing in a much large amount of crackling energy above his head and motes all around. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 83.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9b/Wukong_Thunderclap_83.jpg)

Once all the motes coalesce into his weapon, he'll slam it into the ground to create a massive electrical storm, and soon after, a giant detonation that can usually kill you in a single hit. This attack can't be dodged (even in Pillar Stance), but it can be outrun if you flee to the far corners of the room away from him (though it still has a mighty range). 

If you feel like you can't escape in time, you can also try interrupting this attack - the Wind Tamer Vessel is a great pick for this as it will stun him no matter what he's doing! 

![Wukong Thunderclap 84.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/ba/Wukong_Thunderclap_84.jpg)

Finally, in his angered state he can also unleash a much longer combo attack, often while yelling about how he's going to guide the world. If you can't get enough distance from him, be ready to try deflecting or Immobilizing him, or you'll have to dodge a series of three sweeping attacks as he slides his mace along the ground, then swings it over his head four times, followed by a large windup as he pulls it around from behind his back in one large sweeping strikes. 

The better understanding you have of his attacks and their range, the more ready you'll be to deal with each of them in turn, evading his lightining strikes and quelling any shock status to minimize damage. Use the downtimes from his slower attacks to hit him hard with Spirit Attacks and expending your Focus Points to stagger him onto the ground. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 85.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/42/Wukong_Thunderclap_85.jpg)

Once you've taken out his entire health bar, he'll disappear again, sometimes summoning a lightning storm to track you as you try and race back over to him. Take it slow and focus on evasion rather than trying to close the distance. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 86.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a8/Wukong_Thunderclap_86.jpg)

This battle may be won, but the war is far from over. Yellowbrow will freeze you in place, and use his magic seed sack to draw you into a perilous prison. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 87.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ed/Wukong_Thunderclap_87.jpg)

When you awaken, you'll finally find out what happened to your friend Zhu Bajie -- he's also been captured, and forced to fight in here against another familiar face: The Macaque Chief. It's time for the final round. 

## Yaoguai Chief Miniboss Fight - Macaque Chief (Final Encounter)

For this last bout with the Macaque Chief, your friend Zhu Bajie will be here to help, but will warn you that the sack's magic draws out evil to empower this foe beyond his normal limits. 

Even though you'll have the help of a friend, don't expect this to be an easy fight, as the Macaque Chief hits harder than ever with his evil sword. On the plus side, your health, mana, and gourd will be fully replenished after the Yellowbrow fight, and if you are defeated here, you can re-enter the temple to skip the first fight and pick up where you left off. 

A lot of the Macaque Chief's attacks should look familiar, which is a good thing as you'll be able to accurately react and avoid his most common attacks. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 88.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/64/Wukong_Thunderclap_88.jpg)

Expect him to employ his reliable sword stab where the claws out in front of him before grabbing the sword back with his legs to swing at you with, but the range will be greatly increased. 

He also employs a lot of usual blade swipes, and his multi-hit spinning two-handed swings, which now create large projectiles slashes in front of him. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 89.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/95/Wukong_Thunderclap_89.jpg)

Luckily, the Macaque Chief is just as prone to staggering as he was before, even more-so now thanks to the combined efforts of you and your ally, you can repeatedly knock him out of certain moves with well-times heavy hits that sends him toppling to the ground. A single focus point is you need to poke him off his sword when he stands on it! 

![Wukong Thunderclap 90.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/66/Wukong_Thunderclap_90.jpg)

Unfortunately, it won't be long before the Macaque Chief makes an effort to rectify this, and takes to the air. He'll then send out two shadow versions of himself to fly down and strike you, but they actually stick around to fight! 

While it's tempting to leave the shadows to Zhu Bajie to fight on his own, you're much better off repositioning yourself to take on the clones (and you may even want to summon your own clones if you can find some breathing room. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 93.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/92/Wukong_Thunderclap_93.jpg)

The clones don't have a whole lot of health (but they can replicate most of his moves - including poison spewing!), so go all in and blitz them quickly with a combination of Spirits attacks and Transformation Spells like Ashen Slumber, getting in enough hits to detonate yourself and deal massive damage to everyone if possible. 

The sooner you remove the clones from the fight, the sooner you'll be able to tag team the Macaque Chief again -- but be prepared for him to pull the similar trick later on if the fight is drawn out long enough. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 95.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/85/Wukong_Thunderclap_95.jpg)

Instead of permanent clones, he can also fly up and create kamikaze versions of his shadow clones to fly at you for a single slash, while he prepares a mighty slash of his own as a third and final shadow comes your way. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 91.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3d/Wukong_Thunderclap_91.jpg)

Even without clones, he can still fly up to charge his sword, and then charge you with a fast-diving slash attack that you can deflect head on to stop him in his tracks. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 92.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fa/Wukong_Thunderclap_92.jpg)

If you dodge instead, be ready for him to pivot into a jumping slash attack after landing, which will expel a cyclone of blade slashes around him after a short delay. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 94.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/02/Wukong_Thunderclap_94.jpg)

Another new move he can perform when jumping on his blade will be to launch himself into the air instead of slashing with it, which will expel a handful of projectiles feathers from his wings that will fly down at you quickly after hanging in the air for a moment. If you have the time, you can spin your staff, or just simply dodge as they will all reach you at the same moment. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 96.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e4/Wukong_Thunderclap_96.jpg)

After you've defeated his clones and beaten the Macaque Chief one final time, the Destined One will stand victorious, but the evil energies of the seed sack will warp your mind, transforming you into that which you have sought to defeat! 

### Floating Sculpture

Yellowbrow will then scoop you out of the sack and place your tiny form into his Floating Sculpture with all his other "disciples". 

![Wukong Thunderclap 97.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e1/Wukong_Thunderclap_97.jpg)

In this new transformed state, you'll have little else to do but slash through all of the figures that try to oppose you. 

The good news in all of this is you'll be pretty unstoppable in this mode. Your light attacks will unleash a flurry of wide sweep attacks, and your heavy strike will perform his spinning slash move. 

Keep defeating any disciple that stands in your path, and move along the platforms and descend to the bottom. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 98.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/92/Wukong_Thunderclap_98.jpg)

One you reach a Clay Vajra, you'll be infused with even more power, and your standard slashes will now cast small projectiles blades out in front of you. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 99.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/01/Wukong_Thunderclap_99.jpg)

Not long after you reach the next section, you'll grow wings, and your projectile slashes will tear through anything in your path with ease. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 100.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/06/Wukong_Thunderclap_100.jpg)

Keep moving down until you reach the bottom shelf, and you'll find another pathway back up on the opposite side of Yellowbrow's little diorama. Once you clear a path to a large open arena, Yellowbrow himself will shrink down to meet you in combat for a final bout. 

## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Yellowbrow (Round Two)

![Wukong Thunderclap 101.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d6/Wukong_Thunderclap_101.jpg)

When this final match begins, you'll still be stuck in the Macaque Chief form, but only for a short duration (and won't return to this form if you die and respawn) so you might as well unleash as many attacks as possible while you can. 

Yellowbrow has a lot of his same moves from your last fight, but several new ones that are even more devious and annoying to deal with. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 102.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/14/Wukong_Thunderclap_102.jpg)

The one you'll likely encounter fairly early on is his new ability to cast himself in a gold-plated protection form. 

In this form, your attacks will simply bounce off like the Tiger Vanguard's Stone Form, but he won't readily revert back, and continue to attack in this impervious form. 

Instead, you'll want to find openings to hit him back with a heavy attack. If you have any Focus Points stored up, you can briefly stagger him, but even without any focus points its a better alternative than getting knocked back trying to use a light attack. You can also try ingesting consumables that raise your focus for an easier time breaking his gold form. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 104.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b3/Wukong_Thunderclap_104.jpg)

After 2-3 heavy hits (or a single heavy strike with 3 focus points), his golden protection will shatter, and leave Yellowbrow stunned for an extended period of time. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 107.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d8/Wukong_Thunderclap_107.jpg)

Use this period to unleash your best Spirit Attack (Non-Pure's extended combo can be huge here as he's unable to attack back) and hit him with your biggest stikes while he's unable to move. 

When he regains his composure, he'll strike back with more lightning attacks than ever, and once again you'll need to be extremely careful about not retaining the Shocked status, or you'll often die from a single stray blow. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 103.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/19/Wukong_Thunderclap_103.jpg)

One of his hardest hitting new attacks will start with him holding his mace up and imbuing it with light, causing a huge light to shine out from its end as he holds it back over his head. 

You'll need to avoid this overhead strike at all costs by rapidly strafing and dodging around him, as the vertical slam will cause that giant bolt of lightning to cleave the ground, creating a permanent electric scar in the ground (and will almost certainly cleave more than half your health on hit, or instantly kill you if you're taking double damage from a Shocked state). 

![Wukong Thunderclap 106.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7a/Wukong_Thunderclap_106.jpg)

The scar will persist and continue to deal lightning damage if you walk too close to it, and as you learn this attack, you may want to try baiting him into slamming down in a corner to cover the least amount of ground. 

Among his more familiar attacks, he can also detonate his mace after slamming into the ground after a short delay, so be ready if you notice the mace continue to glow (if it doesn't, you'll be a bit safer to engage near his weapon). 

Other times, these detonations can trigger a series of lightning bolts to explode outward around him, both spreading in a line from his strikes and also seeking you out. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 105.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/44/Wukong_Thunderclap_105.jpg)

This second fight is spaced into three phases, during which Yellowbrow will stop the fight momentarily to string you about like a rag doll. This means you can only take a third of his health bar off before he'll stop taking damage and stun you, which is worth noting so that you don't try and unleash a huge stored up attack when he's about to start a new phase. 

Even worse, when you take off the first third of his health, he'll stun you with electricity and then smack you around with his mace. This unavoidable cutscene actually takes off around 40% of your health, and is what we like to call a dick move. 

He'll usually begin the next phase of the fight be performing another of his electrical cleaving attacks to tear another part of the ground, and with your low health, you'll need to quickly heal up or evade or risk an instant death! 

![Wukong Thunderclap 113.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fa/Wukong_Thunderclap_113.jpg)

In his second phase, he'll often throw in more attacks into the mix, including a deadly binding spell that creates a ring of electricity around you. You'll be unable to escape this ring, and he will start tossing projectiles at you that you'll need to spin your staff to get rid of. 

![Wukong Thunderclap 114.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Wukong_Thunderclap_114.jpg)

Luckily, he'll usually stand around gloating after this, giving you time to heal up and ingest more consumables to buff up until the ring dissipates (You can also use Wind Tamer to immediately dispel the ring if you don't feel like waiting).

Other times, he can now raise his mace up to trigger a lightning storm all around the arena. These strikes will both track your position and also appear all over the arena, making it tough to evade them all unless you can stagger him out of it.

If he starts to channel energy within himself, watch for light to shine out of his body and electrical threads appear all around. You'll need to quickly sprint away as the very air around him will raise your shock meter, and after a few moments, he'll explode and deal a lethal amount of damage in a very large radius.

When you finally reach the last third of Yellowbrow's health, he'll again toss you into the air, and this time the Apramana Bat will catch you and fling you around. You'll actually gain the Apramana Bat Spirit during this sequence, and fly right at him only to be knocked to the ground - again taking off a chunk of your health in an unavoidable scene. 

In this final phase, Yellowbrow is more likely than ever to summon his giant lighting blast again as he creates motes of lightning all around him, meaning you'll need to race to the far corner or use something like the Wind Tamer to snap him out of it.

He can also more frequently employ lots of very deadly moves, like repeatedly swinging his electrified mace around him in multiple arcs with large electric waves of force that have an additional delayed detonation. 

You'll need to play things very smart and cautious now, and don't be afraid to pause and use additional consumables, including rare ones given by the Xu Dog in the Zodiac Village. This match is a true endurance test, and you'll want to use everything in your arsenal to keep Yellowbrow on the defensive.

If you've run out of juice from your gourd, consider consuming medicine to increase your max health, or swap to a Transformation Spell to survive attacks you may not otherwise live through. 

With enough patience and practice, and dodging his particularly deadly attacks, you'll at last cut Yellowbrow down to size. He'll try to flee the temple back onto the frozen lake at Mirrormere, only to be swallowed up by the Sage's Relic under the lake.

The true mischievous lord that you've met beforehand will finally take his rightful place, and bestow upon you the third Sage's Relic: the Hubris Nose. You'll be able to reveal one of three perks with it: 

  * Lingering Aroma - Gains a moderate Damage Bonus for a short time after casting a spell.
  * In One Breath - Focus Points can be charged up to 4 within the Ring of Fire
  * Hold Breath - Moderately extends Dodge invincibility duration.

At last, your journey through The New West is at an end. With three relics obtained, there's only three more to go, and both you and Zhu Bajie will be traveling to the darkened forests of the **Webbed Hollow** next.
