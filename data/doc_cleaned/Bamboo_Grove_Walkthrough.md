The Bamboo Grove is the second main region of Chapter 1's Black Wind Mountain in Black Myth: Wukong. Below you'll find a guide to the progressing through the grove and learning how to cultivate Spirits, accessing a secret realm, as well as how to defeat the many bosses of this area that include Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang, Guangmou, and the Whiteclad Noble.

## Back Hills

Heading down the stairway from the back of the temple, you’ll find a new valley with a few Wolf enemies still lingering. 

![Wukong Bamboo 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/eb/Wukong_Bamboo_1.jpg)

Before moving on, be sure to hug the left wall to find a small path leading to a cave. Inside, you’ll find a friendly Horse Guai. 

![Wukong Bamboo 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3c/Wukong_Bamboo_2.jpg)

The whip-wielding warrior will offer some interesting insight about the Black Wind King that rules over this mountain, and the greed and lies that have infected him and his people. While you’re here, you can interact with a small pillow in the middle of the cave to rest at a new **Meditation Spot** in front of the altar, granting you a new Skill Point. 

The Cavern, Bamboo Grove Meditation Spot

Back outside, continue on the main path taking out the three lesser wolves and harvesting Jade Lotus from the pond and Gentian on to the right of the path. 

![Wukong Bamboo 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d5/Wukong_Bamboo_3.jpg)

Look for some broken fencing path the plants on the right and you’ll find a new type of Wolf, the Wolf Sentinel, who uses a small halberd for quick slicing attacks. Dodge around them and his final jump attack before unleashing a charged attack of your own, and then loot the large wooden chest he was guarding to grab 270 **Will** and 2 **Stone Spirit**. 

Continue along the main narrow path and down some stairs until you see a large slab with a mural on it. Just to the right is a small alcove that holds a Snake-Head Mushroom you can harvest. 

![Wukong Bamboo 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4e/Wukong_Bamboo_4.jpg)

Ahead of you is the base of some small falls where a few Croaky frog Guai are waiting among some Jade Lotus, and a green wisp with a few Will to grab at. Another wisp can be found below the opposite falls, by starting to head up the stone stairs on the side and looking left for a small canyon. 

![Wukong Bamboo 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f7/Wukong_Bamboo_5.jpg)

To advance, keep heading up the stairway to cross the high bridge over the falls, where you’ll soon see the golden trail of a nearby shrine beckoning you left. Before making that turn, be sure to look to the right to find a small wooden gazebo with a small table, and open the small gold box on top to find a variety of medicines, including 2 **Tiger Subduing Pellets** , 1 **Evil Repelling Medicament** and 1 **Amplification Pellet**. 

## Snake Trail

![Wukong Bamboo 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/da/Wukong_Bamboo_6.jpg)

As you reach the site of the Shrine, you’ll need to deal with an angry Crow Diviner who guards it (these types of enemies don’t respawn, thankfully). Be wary of their fast reverse blade swings and jumping claw kicks, and rest up after they’ve been defeated. 

The main path lies up the stairs to the right, but be sure to look in the awning over to the left of the shrine first for some pots to break. Technically, you can find a big shortcut by simply jumping over the rocks to the nearby canyon stream, but there’s important things to find while taking the main route first. 

![Wukong Bamboo 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1d/Wukong_Bamboo_7.jpg)

The most important of which is just up the stairs and to the right before reaching a large bridge. A strange human man with a giant gourd on his back will be reciting poetry and drawing with his back to you. 

As you approach, he’ll ask if you’ve seen the nameless souls in your travels - referring to the green wisps floating about that only offer a small amount of Will as they fly away. The wise master will take your gourd and inscribe a blessing on it, allowing you to absorb wayward spirits. This will allow you to finally capture the floating green wisps to not only gain much more Will, but also slightly replenish your Gourd’s healing charges. 

Even more importantly, you’ll now find that certain enemies will leave behind departed Spirits that can be claimed, and allow you to temporarily transform into them to unleash a specific attack. Unlike the Red Waves spell, these Spirits can be equipped to a special slot, and will become charged as you fight and earn Qi. Once the bar is filled, you can then unleash their attack by holding the right trigger and then the left trigger (R2/RT + L2/LT). 

![Wukong Bamboo 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c7/Wukong_Bamboo_8.jpg)  
There’s a chance you may already have one such Spirit, if you decided to test your might early — against the Wandering Wight in the Forest of Wolves. If you already defeated him but were unable to claim his purple spirit, return to a Shrine and you’ll find it under the Retrieve Spirits option, and can then equip it in your inventory. 

If you haven’t yet defeated him, now is a great time to try again — and you can also grab the other wandering green spirit wisps that evaded your grasp the first time around (they’ll reappear after resting): 

![Wukong Bamboo 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/49/Wukong_Bamboo_11.jpg)

  * Below the very first bridge in the Front Hills
  * Near the arena where you fought Guangzhi and learned the Red Tides spell
  * At the Guanyin Temple entrance by the Shrine in front of a wolf statue altar
  * Back down the path in the Bamboo Grove where the falls are

![Wukong Bamboo 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8c/Wukong_Bamboo_9.jpg)

When you’re ready to proceed, head across the large bridge to find a new type of enemy, the Snake Patroller. These spear-wielding snake-men will stand up straight up before lunging at you with a bite that inflicts major damage while poisoning you, which may force you to use Anti-miasma powder to negate its effects. They can also put their spear in their teeth and dash with it held horizontally to swing it about in a combo attack. 

![Wukong Bamboo 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/74/Wukong_Bamboo_10.jpg)

Once you’ve cleared the snake, check out the next area to find another Snake-Head Mushroom, and continue along the path to a field of bones. Three bodies will come to life as Skeletal Snakes. Thankfully, since it takes a moment for them to come to life, and they are fairly weak, they’ll fall to only a couple of staff strikes — usually before they can try to grab at you. 

![Wukong Bamboo 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/49/Wukong_Bamboo_12.jpg)

Heading down the trail from the Skeletal Snakes, you’ll find a stream where another Snake Patroller wanders, as well as an optional area you can investigate by following the stream instead of going under the bridge (though you should still look just past the bridge to find green wisp spirits to capture for a huge amount of Will). 

![Wukong Bamboo 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/45/Wukong_Bamboo_13.jpg)

This path leads to a marshy swamp area full of tall white reed flowers. Several Croaky enemies hide within them, so use your lock-on to identify them so you aren’t ambushed. However, as you make your way through the marsh toward a large stone mural in the cliffs, an optional mini-boss will leap out to fight you. 

### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang

A gargantuan Yaoguai Toad, Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang will waste no time leaping into battle with a powerful slam attack from the air. While he doesn’t have many moves, they can often land extremely quickly, which means you’ll need to be ready to dodge at any moment. 

![Wukong Bamboo 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b5/Wukong_Bamboo_16.jpg)

His most standard attack includes a series of swipes with both arms that sends him forward, ending in a small leaping splash attack that allows him to reposition. By dodging the first swipe to the side, you can wait for him to leap back towards you and then use Immobilize to keep in place while you attack. He can also use any of these swipes and slams independently as well as in a three-hit combo, so look for a follow-up attack before deciding to commit to countering with your own attacks. 

![Wukong Bamboo 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0c/Wukong_Bamboo_15.jpg)

There are two extremely fast and damaging attacks you’ll need to beware of. The first comes when he’s directly facing you, and the toad will pause momentarily lowering his arms across his chest. He’ll then lunge at you belly first in an extremely quick dash, and you’ll have to dodge the body slam quickly to the side before striking back. 

![Wukong Bamboo 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a3/Wukong_Bamboo_17.jpg)

Be wary when dodging around to his back, or when you see him reposition himself by hopping and turning his body. Instead of landing from the hop, he’ll spring out his legs with surprising reach to perform a frog leg kick with massive power, and can use it twice in a row! 

![Wukong Bamboo 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3b/Wukong_Bamboo_18.jpg)

Finally, he can unleash a tongue attack that sweeps back and forth with a large reach several times, and will require you to dodge back and forth out of its path — or use your Immobilize to stop him in the act. Using your Red Tide spell to transform can also help out during these attacks as he’ll be vulnerable to getting hit from the side. 

![Wukong Bamboo 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a5/Wukong_Bamboo_19.jpg)

When Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang finally falls, he’ll leave behind his purple Spirit and a Tadpole Material. Using your new Blessed Gourd upgrade, you can now absorb the Spirit and add Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang’s power to your own, and temporarily transform to unleash a tongue attack against several enemies. If you decide to commit to cultivating his spirit and upgrading its damage potential, you can use the Tadpole he dropped to further upgrade it later on. 

Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang

![Wukong Bamboo 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5f/Wukong_Bamboo_20.jpg)

From the mini-boss lair, you can head past where the toad emerged from to the right to find a path with a green wisp Spirit you can absorb for a decent amount of Will. Past this is a Snake-Head Mushroom, and a ledge that will lead down to a larger central area that the main path also leads to. 

![Wukong Bamboo 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3d/Wukong_Bamboo_21.jpg)

This bamboo forest is full of various Snake Patrollers, and a great amount of Skeletal Snake bones lying in wait and just waiting to ambush you as the bones awaken. Because of this, it’s best to proceed slowly through this region and alert the snakes one by one, defeating them as they come alive, and luring the living Snake Patrollers backward so your fights don’t attract more attention. 

![Wukong Bamboo 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3f/Wukong_Bamboo_22.jpg)

There’s just a few materials to find in this large circular grove, including more Snake-Head Mushroom — and one by a broken stone brazier that is actually a Fungiling in disguise. Much like the Ginsengling, these plant-head monsters are fairly durable and hit hard with a poleblade, so try to shut them down with Immobilize to press the attack while you can. 

![Wukong Bamboo 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Wukong_Bamboo_23.jpg)

To proceed, look for a small dirt path lined by a few fires through the bamboo grove to a set of statues on either side of a small opening in the walls. On the other side, another large bamboo grove is home to a humble yet deadly Yaoguai Chief. 

### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Guangmou

Guangmou is one of the more tricky fights you’ll have faced so far, relying on a variety of sneaky projectile attacks to keep you on the defensive and limit your ability to pursue him. Though he’s not technically a snake, you will find yourself in danger of being poisoned during this fight, so you may want to buy a few anti-poison medicine from the Shrine’s shop. 

![Wukong Bamboo 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/da/Wukong_Bamboo_26.jpg)

He’ll almost always begin the fight by summoning a cluster of homing ghostly projectiles that burst out of him before tracking you down. You can avoid the group by dodging to the side, or holding down your staff spin until they’ve been deflected. 

![Wukong Bamboo 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5e/Wukong_Bamboo_28.jpg)

However, Guangmou will usually create these as a distraction, and teleport up close to you while you’re busy trying to dodge his projectiles. Once he’s up close, beware of his poison spitting attack where he sprays in a large area in front of him. 

![Wukong Bamboo 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d3/Wukong_Bamboo_24.jpg)

His other main projectile attack comes out much faster, as he levitates off the ground for a moment before shooting out a line of the spells in front of him. They don’t track you like the others, but they will shoot rapidly downward and into the ground in front of him. 

![Wukong Bamboo 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/29/Wukong_Bamboo_25.jpg)

When he’s got some range on you, listen up for some of his call-outs. If he yells “Storm forth!” he’ll soon create a gusty orb surrounded by leaves that will slowly float toward you. This one can’t be deflected since it won’t do damage on its own. Once it reaches your position, the gust will issue forth and in a moment become a small violent tornado that will knock you down! 

![Wukong Bamboo 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c5/Wukong_Bamboo_29.jpg)

An interesting note is that he needs to control the orb’s direction, meaning you can cast Immobilize when he summons the orb to lock both him and his projectile in place, nullifying the attack! 

Sometimes, he won’t even bother with the orb, and will simply wave his fan rapidly to create a tornado at your last known position, so staying mobile and pressing your attack can help you avoid these attacks. 

![Wukong Bamboo 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/10/Wukong_Bamboo_27.jpg)

Easily the most annoying move in his repertoire is when he calls out to his “Boys”. He’ll then summon a number of poisonous snakes out of the ground all over the arena, who will all spit venom at you around 5-6 times before vanishing. While they technically do have health bar, it’s not worth engaging with any of them — giving you two viable options: Run and dodge like crazy, or find a corner of the arena where you can see them all, and use your staff spin to nullify the projectiles. This last trick won’t last forever due to the stamina drain, and also due to Guangmou’s meddling during the summons, but it can provide a temporary respite. 

![Wukong Bamboo 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/80/Wukong_Bamboo_30.jpg)

The good news is other than his poison spray, Guangmou doesn’t really have any melee attacks to defend himself at close range — other than a very slow repulsing explosion he needs to charge up by spinning while he gathers energy. Use this to your advantage by pressing your light attack combos whenever you close the gap, and if you have defeated the Wandering Wight, use its Spirit Attack to knock him down with a mighty headbutt to keep him from teleporting away. 

![Wukong Bamboo 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/11/Wukong_Bamboo_31.jpg)

Another good strategy to note is that if you’re in danger of getting close to becoming poisoned, using the Red Tides spell can help you transform out of danger. Any status effects suffered while transformed as Guangzhi will be removed when you regain your regular health bar. As an added bonus, Guangmou will even comment on your transformation. 

Once you’ve learned how to evade his projectiles, the rest of the fight will just boil down to chasing him down and stunning him however you can with Immobilize, your Spirit Attack, and other heavy hits. When he falls, you’ll gain Guangmou’s Spirit to add to your collection, allowing you to summon venomous snakes of your own! 

Guangmou

## Black Wind Mountain’s Secret - Ringing the Second Bell

![Wukong Bamboo 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ab/Wukong_Bamboo_32.jpg)  
As the boss falls, the Keeper will comment on the two fallen Yaoguai Guangmou and Guangzhi. Both monks apparently aided an Elder named Jinchi to burn down the temple and the monk within alive — but that’s not all they share: Just up the sloping stairway path to the left of the way forward, you can find a second large bell that you can ring. Something ominous seems to be responding to the sound of these bells. 

![Wukong Bamboo 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ae/Wukong_Bamboo_33.jpg)

Look for a way forward beyond a small archway to the side of the boss arena, and climb the winding stairs to follow a trail of gold leading to the next Shrine. 

### Marsh of the White Mist

![Wukong Bamboo 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/18/Wukong_Bamboo_34.jpg)

This next area is a fairly quick one, but it’s also very important for a few different reasons. Before moving on from the Shrine, be sure to look across from it for a tall tree with yellow flowers hanging from it, and gather the ‘’’Luojia Fragrant Vine’’’. 

![Wukong Bamboo 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/62/Wukong_Bamboo_35.jpg)

As you head down the path from the Shrine, you’ll come upon a lone Snake Patroller harassing a fellow monkey who is hanging from the branches above. Teach the snake a lesson by dodging his lunging bite and then finishing him off. Doing so will award you a lot of loot, including the ‘’’Gall Gem’’’, which you’ll learn more about very soon. 

![Wukong Bamboo 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1b/Wukong_Bamboo_37.jpg)

Follow the friendly Shen Monkey inside to the cave on the right, and you’ll find that he’s a merchant of gourds, drinks, and brews! Be sure to check all of his options out: 

  * Upgrade Gourds - By using the Luojia Fragrant Vine you just found by the nearby Shrine, you upgrade the charges in your Old Gourd from 4 swings to 5, turning into a Medicine Gourd, and giving you more uses of its healing properties.
  * Upgrade Drinks - The default drink stored in your healing Gourd is Coconut Wine, which restores a third of your health for each swig. Once you find Awaken Wine Worms, return to him and you’ll be able to upgrade the amount healed with each use!
  * Brew - With your equipped Drink, you can enhance it by adding a Soak to increase additional effects beyond the heal. You can try it out now by adding the Gall Gem, which will increase your poison resistance in addition to the heal from your Gourd.
  * Store - If the Gall Gem isn’t all that enticing, be sure to check his shop, as the Shen Monkey sells **Celestial Lotus Seeds** , which can be used as an alternative Soak that continues to recover some health after the gourd’s initial heal!

![Wukong Bamboo 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/94/Wukong_Bamboo_38.jpg)

Once you’re done chatting with the Shen Monkey, be sure to look near the wooden scaffolding ledge by a large statue, and absorb a green wisp spirit to earn a bunch of Will. You can drop down below for a shortcut down the main path along with a Snake-Head Mushroom, but there’s one more thing to grab outside first. 

![Wukong Bamboo 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/35/Wukong_Bamboo_39.jpg)

Exit the cave with the Shen Monkey and cross the wooden platform where you fought the Snake Patroller to the other side. In a small building on the far side, you can find a large chest that holds 2 **Tiny Piece of Gold** and 2 **Stone Spirit**. 

![Wukong Bamboo 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fe/Wukong_Bamboo_40.jpg)

When you’re ready to move on, make sure you’re fully healed up from dealing with that snake, as the end of this downward path leads to the titular marsh where a very strong boss waits to block your path. 

## Boss Fight - Whiteclad Noble

This snake-like noble will attempt to test your resolve, and he’s got the skills to back it up, so don’t take this boss lightly. Oddly enough, despite his appearance, he doesn’t employ any poison attacks, so having the Celestial Lotus Seeds as your gourd’s Soak is the better option for this fight. 

The Whiteclad Noble opts instead to attack with his strong spear, and can harness the power of water itself to amplify its reach. He’ll use it often to create waves of watery force you’ll need to dodge or suffer a lot of damage from. He’s also not above simply tossing his spear at you, and then calling it back to his hand. 

![Wukong Bamboo 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/84/Wukong_Bamboo_41.jpg)

This boss usually begins the battle with a jumping lunge attack, but is also highly mobile and will retreat without warning to reposition himself. Get your hits in when able, but be wary as you pursue his retreats. His jumping lunge can be used when he dodges and strafes around you, so be on your guard whenever he starts to move around the arena quickly. 

![Wukong Bamboo 44.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e4/Wukong_Bamboo_44.jpg)

His most common attack up close from a series of spear swings — starting with two quick swings and the delayed thrust — or sometimes three slower swinging attacks. Oftentimes, he’ll follow these with another set of five quick spear swings, and ending with a sixth jumping attack. Unless you have a full bar of stamina, dodging the bulk of them can prove tricky, so you may want to dance out of range until you can dodge under his final jump and then retaliate — or use your Immobilize Spell to interrupt his combo entirely. 

![Wukong Bamboo 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/82/Wukong_Bamboo_42.jpg)

Many times he employs either the first half or the entire combo attack, he’ll wait a moment before readying his next move. Watch for him to pull his spear back as he twists his body, as after a brief delay he will swing his spear around in a circle spin that’s tough to dodge, as it creates a delayed watery shockwave circle further out. Because of this, you’ll want to dodge toward him, and not retreat into the shockwave. 

![Wukong Bamboo 49.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/72/Wukong_Bamboo_49.jpg)

At range, he may do a backwards twirl, but this is only to prepare a very fast spear throw in your direction. Dodge to the side and prepare for him to follow his spear, grabbing onto the embedded weapon and spin around it to launch himself at you once more feet first, and then one final lunge with his spear for a third and final strike. 

![Wukong Bamboo 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7a/Wukong_Bamboo_43.jpg)

Even more deadly is his ability to begin twirling his spear as you can your staff — only his version will kick up thin waves of water to send your way. He’ll send about 6 damaging projectile waves this way, and then charge up for a lunging thrust to follow up with. You can simply strafe and outpace the waves of force, and ready yourself to dodge his thrust before countering. 

![Wukong Bamboo 50.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5c/Wukong_Bamboo_50.jpg)

Unfortunately, you’re going to need to memorize these attacks and learn to take as little damage as possible, because depleting his health bar won’t end the fight. When you’ve knocked him down, he’ll begin to show you his true form, elongating his body in a larger serpent form, and replenishing his entire health bar. 

![Wukong Bamboo 51.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f4/Wukong_Bamboo_51.jpg)

For phase two, you’ll find that many of his attacks are pretty similar to the first phase, and he doesn’t have too many extra surprises up his sleeve. Due to his new posture, his 360 degree circle spin attack is a bit harder to see coming as his spear will dip into the water, so you’ll need to watch him moves carefully. 

Sometimes, he’ll raise his spear higher, and will do a frontal sweep rather than his spin, but his snake body will quickly slither off before you can counter, meaning you’ll have to Immobilize him instead or quickly follow him. 

![Wukong Bamboo 52.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/21/Wukong_Bamboo_52.jpg)

Instead of the previous spear twirling to create waves of force, he’ll get more aggressive, and rise up out of the water to slash back and forth to create several diagonal waves that are a bit harder to dodge than his old vertical slices. 

![Wukong Bamboo 53.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f8/Wukong_Bamboo_53.jpg)

In addition to this, he can twirl his spear above his head, summoning water above it before slamming it down, sending a straight line of water right at you that you can dodge to the side to avoid. 

Beyond that, the rest of the second phase of this fight will come down to anticipating how his body twists before he unleashes his sweep attacks. Keep close and aggressive to dodge around to his sides, using your spells to amplify your attacks, and looking for the right moment to invoke your Spirit Attacks (the Wandering Wight is still a good choice when he’s stationary to flatten him). 

![Wukong Bamboo 54.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/48/Wukong_Bamboo_54.jpg)

Defeat him to earn a **Jade Fang** , and he’ll concede, revealing he was only feigning loyalty to the king of this mountain to learn more. He’ll also drop a helpful nugget of wisdom as he departs, mentioning though the temple lies in cinders, the Elder’s soul endures, and asks if you’ve seen the three bells. 

Whiteclad Noble

This will finally prompt the Keeper to tell the tale of the three bells — two of which you’ve found guarded by Guangmou and Guangzhi. The third happens to lie not far from this site. Instead of moving forward, look to the left to spot a flooded ravine to travel through. 

![Wukong Bamboo 55.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/75/Wukong_Bamboo_55.jpg)

On the other side, you’ll find a large open area where several Wolf Guais are seated in front of the final bell, as well as a hanged wolf on a nearby tree.

Defeat the Wolves that guard this area, and you can find and ring the last bell in Black Wind Mountain. Doing so will allow you to be taken to a secret area with its own boss: **The Ancient Guanyin Temple**. 

If you’re ready for a tough secret boss fight, you can enter the burned temple to face off against Elder Jinchi, and you can view strategies to defeat this boss here. 

Otherwise, return to the marsh and head through the structure the Whiteclad Noble was guarding to leave the Bamboo Grove behind and enter the final area of the Black Wind Mountain - **Black Wind Cave**.
