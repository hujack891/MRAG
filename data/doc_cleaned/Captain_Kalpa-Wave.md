To find him, you'll need to make your way through the Valley of Ecstasy after crossing the Bitter Lake, and head through the Path of Longevity toward the large pagoda tower rising above the New Thunderclap Temple in the distance.

As you approach, a large bloody miasma will block your advance. Once it congeals, you'll find yourself facing the last of the four captains. 

### Captain Kalpa-Wave Miniboss Fight and Guide

As the last of the four captains, Kalpa-Wave looks scarier than he actually is, especially once you learn his tricks. 

With his large towering body, Kapla-Wave has a few physical attacks that generally alternate between stomps of his legs, or a mighty leap that causes him to crash into the ground, but both attacks aren't too bad to deal with. 

What really makes Kalpa-Wave unique is his ability to spew blood out. Lots of it. This can take on many forms, and you'll need to know how to deal with each of them.

One of the most basic attacks will be when it spews out a group of bloody projectiles from its body. They'll take to the air before arcing slowly over in your direction, but spinning your staff can let you clear them without issue. 

Sometimes he'll throw several blood attacks into the mix one after the other to mess you up. Expect these bloody trails to come out in multiple directions (both above and from the sides) to try and confuse you, but remain focused on deflecting them as they arrive.

Other times he'll mix up his blood projectiles by also creating more blood, which include a stomp attack (or bending down to tilt the wings on its back) that generates a trail of blood heading in your direction. Dodge the blood trails, or they'll burst into a bloody lotus flowers that damage you as they erupt.

The real danger isn't the lotus itself, its what it leaves behind. Similar to that Frog Guai's ice attacks coating the area in frost, many of Kalpa-Wave's attacks (including stomps!) will leave behind large pools of blood. Stepping into any of these pools for a second will start to drain your health, so you'll need to steer clear of them at all costs!

Much of this fight will come down to being constantly mobile to evade the various pools of blood Kalpa-Wave will create, and find times after deflecting his projectiles to run up and unleash damage on the boss.

Be especially careful if Captain Kalpa-Wave starts to jump up and down repeatedly. On the third jump, all pools of blood will explode into explosive lotus flowers, meaning you'll need to either be on the move, or use your Pillar Stance to rise above the attacks.

The good news is Kalpa-Wave is extremely susceptible to getting knocked down. So long as you build up some focus points with light attacks where possible, you can use your Pillar Stance heavy attack with three focus points built up to send the boss crashing to the ground -- which is the perfect time to Immobilize him on the ground and go wild with Spirit Attacks and Transformations.

Beyond this, Kalpa-Wave doesn't have too many other variations on his moves, so as long as you avoid those blood pools, you'll be able to cut him down to size, and gain the Spirit of Captain Kalpa-Wave to add to your collection.
