## Black Wind Cave

Heading into the large cave entrance behind where you fought the Whiteclad Noble, it’ll be pretty dark inside, but you can’t fall in the large central pit a tree is growing out of, so not to worry. 

![Wukong BlackWind 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e3/Wukong_BlackWind_1.jpg)

Stick to the right side of the cave, and you’ll find some green wisp Spirit to absorb for its Will. 

![Wukong BlackWind 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/6c/Wukong_BlackWind_3.jpg)

Once you reach a shaft of light in the cave where a Gentian plant grows, look ahead to find a Wolf Assassin. Due to the low visibility ahead, let the creature come to you and dodge its twinblade attacks before hitting with a charged strike. 

Head further into the tunnel until it opens up with more light, and you’ll find a very large wooden balcony ahead, as the main path curves to the right. 

![Wukong BlackWind 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/70/Wukong_BlackWind_4.jpg)

Be sure to head out onto the balcony, as you’ll find the third and final **Meditation Spot** in Black Wind Mountain, earning you another free Spark Skill Point. 

The Cliff, Black Wind Cave Meditation Spot

Next to the Meditation Spot, you can also find a small golden pot that holds a **Celestial Taiyi Pill** , which will greatly increase your maximum mana like the other pill did for your health.

Return to the path and take the stairs up to fight against another Wolf Assassin as the cave grows dark, and draw them into the light if needed. 

As you reach an open part of the cave, you’ll have to face one more assassin along the darkened path, and you may notice they’ll go out of their way to destroy the torches along the path to further envelop them in darkness. If you have trouble facing them, always try to bring them to a brighter spot. 

## Cave Interior

![Wukong BlackWind 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4d/Wukong_BlackWind_6.jpg)

As you finally reach a large open part of the cave that allows light in, it will shine down on a temple nestled within the cave, where two Wolf Sentinels guard a nearby Shrine. With the shrine so close, go wild with your abilities and spells to quickly mow them down, then rest up. 

Now that you’ve defeated the Whiteclad Noble, new upgrades will be available for your gear in the Shrine’s menu — including three pieces of the Serpentscale Set, and the Twin Snake Staff that you can upgrade from your existing staff by using the Jade Fang the noble dropped. 

![Wukong BlackWind 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/55/Wukong_BlackWind_7.jpg)  
Note that if you went ahead and defeated the Secret Boss by ringing the three bells, you should also have access to craft an additional Bronze Set that improves your abilities using the Immobilize Spell! 

Craft and upgrade whatever you can afford at the moment, because a boss is waiting inside the temple to test your might, and he’s no pushover. 

## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Black Wind King

The self-imposed King of the Black Wind Mountain has been waiting for you, and though he’s only facing you now in his human form, he’s got a lot of powerful attacks to watch out for. 

![Wukong BlackWind 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/32/Wukong_BlackWind_8.jpg)

advertisement

The Black Wind King will start the fight with a jumping spear thrust, pausing in mid-air briefly before lunging forward, and powering his spear with the Black Wind to throw it into the ground in front of him as he lands. 

He’ll often follow this jumping attack with two spins of his spear until it lands behind him, and give you a big opportunity to commence an attack of your own as he recovers from the move. 

![Wukong BlackWind 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/13/Wukong_BlackWind_13.jpg)

Any time he empowers his spear with the black wind effect, you can bet he’ll move close to perform up to three big slash attacks in short succession. Always wait until the third attack lands before trying to counter, and use your Spirit Attack when you know you have room to land the hit. 

![Wukong BlackWind 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bd/Wukong_BlackWind_12.jpg)

advertisement

Be on your guard whenever you try to attack him head on, as his favorite attack at close range is taking a quick swig of his own gourd before breathing flames in front of him. A quick dodge can put you behind him, allowing you to continue your light attack combo as he finishes spraying the area in front of him. 

![Wukong BlackWind 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/79/Wukong_BlackWind_9.jpg)

If you see him raise one foot up, quickly Immobilize or dash to the side, as he’ll try to stagger you with a quick kick, and then race forward with his spear to keep charging into you for multiple hits that’s nearly impossible to get out of once he starts. 

![Wukong BlackWind 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d5/Wukong_BlackWind_10.jpg)

advertisement

His most frustrating attack will come when he transforms into the Black Wind itself, becoming a wisp-like thing that floats around the arena. You’ll need to look carefully for the small “bursts” emanating from the wisp that denote its charge attack straight at you, and can happen in two quick dashes back and forth. 

![Wukong BlackWind 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7a/Wukong_BlackWind_11.jpg)

Once you see the wisp fly up, retreat away from the center of the arena where the Black Wind King will reappear in a large explosion. Take this time to heal up or use any consumable medicines you think might give you an edge. 

![Wukong BlackWind 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1c/Wukong_BlackWind_14.jpg)

advertisement

After losing about half his health, the Black Wind King will get even more aggressive with his titular wind, and start disappearing entirely in a gust without forming into a wisp. When this happens, retreat and regain your stamina, and be ready for the moment he appears, as he’ll likely do so in mid-combo attack. 

![Wukong BlackWind 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/ba/Wukong_BlackWind_15.jpg)

These can include a length combo that he’ll usually start with a shove before stabbing his spear into the ground in front of him, then grabbing onto it to launch himself off feet first before quickly slicing downward at you, and then slamming his fist down for a massive explosion you’ll want to steer clear of. 

![Wukong BlackWind 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/99/Wukong_BlackWind_16.jpg)

advertisement

After his next Black Wind assault, be ready to transform using the Red Tides Spell, and charge up a dash attack the moment he lands in the center of the arena, and use it and the transformation spell’s pogo attack to perform a massive hit once you catch him after a teleport. 

![Wukong BlackWind 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/df/Wukong_BlackWind_17.jpg)

Counter each of his teleports when his attacks complete, and you’ll soon defeat the Yaoguai King, forcing him to retreat as he yells for you to face his true form at the top of the mountain. However, in his retreat, he’ll leave behind some of his Black Wind, which the Keeper of the Mountain will harness and pass onto you, giving you a brand new spell: **Cloud Step**. 

Black Wind King

This spell will allow you to vanish while dashing forward, creating a copy of yourself that enemies will target. While in this mist-like form, you’ll be invisible for a short duration, and attacking will execute an Unveiling Strike for increased damage while catching foes off guard! 

![Wukong BlackWind 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/19/Wukong_BlackWind_18.jpg)

advertisement

Be sure to thoroughly explore this cavern temple after the boss retreats, as there’s plenty of loot to find. Start by checking the far corners to the right when looking back at the entrance you came in through. Look for a group of large pots for one with a golden glow, and break it open to find an **Awaken Wine Worm**. These upgrades can be given to the Shen Monkey back at the Marsh of the White Mist to increase the amount of healing each charge of your Medicine Gourd’s drink will recover! 

![Wukong BlackWind 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/af/Wukong_BlackWind_19.jpg)

You should also look to the right of where the Black Wind King was standing next to the holder for his spear at the start of the battle, where you can find a small wooden table next to two bells with a box. Open it to find an **Agate Jar** — a Curio you can equip. 

![Wukong BlackWind 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bb/Wukong_BlackWind_20.jpg)

advertisement

Check the sides of the cave to find some Jade Lotus and Aged Ginseng, then head to the far end to sidle through an exit. This disguised loading screen will turn the day into dusk as you find yourself closer to the top of the mountain. 

## Outside the Cave

After resting at the nearby Shrine, you can look for a small cliffside path below the shrine for a Snake-Head Mushroom, and then start your ascent to the top of the mountain. 

![Wukong BlackWind 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/20/Wukong_BlackWind_22.jpg)

Just ahead up the path, a Wolf Sentinel and two Wolf Archers will be ready to engage you, so lure the Sentinel back down the path first, and then deflect the arrows as you reach the two archers and deal with them. Just below their position, you can find a lower path with a green wisp Spirit to absorb for some Will. 

![Wukong BlackWind 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/67/Wukong_BlackWind_23.jpg)

advertisement

Nearby you’ll find a large wooden bridge area leading to ruins with an overwhelming amount of Wolf Archers backing up some more Wolf Sentinels. This is the perfect opportunity to employ your new Cloud Strike. Vanish away as you approach them, and in your mist form, race up and head left to find a path up to the high roof where the top archer is. 

Ambush him, and ignore the hulking brute for a moment as you dive back down to attack the other Wolf Archers from behind. Once all are cleared out, return to the long wooden walkway area. 

![Wukong BlackWind 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d8/Wukong_BlackWind_24.jpg)

If you look just to the left of this wooden walkway before the ruins, you can spot a small wooden plank leading off to an area where a Wolf Assassin is waiting in the shadows. Unlike the other assassins you fought in the cave, this one is a lot stronger than the rest, and his evasive maneuvers can make him hard to pin down. 

![Wukong BlackWind 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3d/Wukong_BlackWind_25.jpg)

advertisement

Once you defeat this stronger Wolf Assassin, you’ll find that he will leave behind a Blue Spirit you can absorb for a new Spirit Attack! He also guards a chest you can loot to earn a **Blood of the Iron Bull** material upgrade, and 3 **Stone Spirit**. 

![Wukong BlackWind 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2b/Wukong_BlackWind_26.jpg)

Head back to the rooftop area where a Bullguard like the first mini-boss you fought stands alongside a few more Wolf Archers behind him and on a ledge to the side. Use your Cloud Step to take out the one all the way back, then look for some green slanted rocks to try jump up and then left to reach the ledge with the last archer. 

![Wukong BlackWind 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1c/Wukong_BlackWind_28.jpg)

advertisement

With the ranged support out of the way, you can safely engage the Bullguard. Since this one isn’t a mini-boss, he’ll go down a lot faster when you Immobilize and punish him during his lengthy swing attacks. 

Head along the far wooden platforms past where the Bullguard was stationed to find one last Wolf Sentinel and Archer, and Cloud Step past the melee attacker to slam into the archer first before finishing off his friend. 

![Wukong BlackWind 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/53/Wukong_BlackWind_29.jpg)

Before engaging with more Wolf Guai, pause at a small altar along the cliffs. Here you’ll find one last golden pot to open, containing a **Celestial Nonary Pill** , which will greatly increase your maximum stamina — the third and final pill to find in Chapter 1! 

Black Wind Mountain Celestial Nonary Pill

![Wukong BlackWind 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/85/Wukong_BlackWind_30.jpg)

advertisement

The rest of the long stairway up is lined with assorted Wolf Guai, but between your new Cloud Step, Spirit Attacks, and other new moves, they won’t stand a chance against you. Be sure to look along the left by some graves to find some Aged Ginseng as you keep heading upward. If you run out of mana for your Cloud Step, just keep enemies or the environment between you and the Wolf Archer’s opening salvo, and then rush them when they start shooting single arrows again. 

## Bodhi Peak

![Wukong BlackWind 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/de/Wukong_BlackWind_31.jpg)

When you’ve at least reached the top of the mountain, it’s time to do one final inventory before approaching the final boss of Chapter 1: 

  * Make sure you’ve rung the 3 bells, and fought the secret boss to obtain the Legendary Fireproof Mantle.
  * With the secret boss defeated, you’ll be able to craft most if not all of the Bronze Gear Set for the best armor increase and Immobilize bonuses.
  * You should have also claimed all 3 Celestial Pills to increase your max health, mana, and stamina.
  * Make sure you’ve defeated that optional strong mini-boss, the Wandering Wight back in the Forest of Wolves, not only to gain his Spirit, but to obtain the Cat’s Eye Beads Curio.
  * Cultivate the Spirit you like the most with at least two upgrades if possible (we recommend the Wight for its passive defense increase and massive damaging headbutt).
  * Ensure both your Gourd and Coconut Wine have both been upgraded by the Shen Monkey, and equip the Lotus Seeds as your soak.



This is also a good time to buy the rest of the medicinal items from the store at the Shrine. They don’t replenish over time, and the wares will be different when you reach the next chapter, so there’s no real reason not to stock up. 

Once you’re ready, head up to the peak to find a large pagoda where the first of the Six Senses of the Great Sage rests. Before you can claim it, you’ll have to go through the true form of the Black Wind King. 

## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Black Bear Guai

Instead of a spear, the Black Wind King is now going for overwhelming size and power, and similar to the main boss of the Forest of Wolves, you’ll be up against a very large opponent with huge attack swings. To make matters worse, several parts of the arena are on fire and will absolutely start burning you if you roll into them for too long. 

advertisement

![Wukong BlackWind 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f8/Wukong_BlackWind_32.jpg)

To make matters worse, Black Bear Guai can and will utilize his black wind magic to teleport around the arena, and pop out of thin air in the middle of a two-hit charge attack you’ll need to evade with little warning. 

Even without the wind form, it can be hard to tell which moves the black bear is using when you’re right underneath him, so be sure not to get too far into your attacks that you can’t tell when he’s preparing a new attack. 

![Wukong BlackWind 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c6/Wukong_BlackWind_33.jpg)

advertisement

There’s more than a few attack combos he can launch at close range, including two-hit swipes, which are sometimes followed by a raised foot slam afterward. Later in the fight, he can extend this combo with more slashes before finally slamming his foot down. 

He can also simply belly flop down, requiring you to dodge to the side rather than backwards.This move can come from the front, as well as from the sides if he collapses on his side, meaning even if you aren’t attacking from the front you won’t automatically be safe. 

![Wukong BlackWind 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d5/Wukong_BlackWind_34.jpg)

One of the more easy attacks to punish will have him gallop around to your side before leaping into the air for a big diving attack. It will take him a few moments to get up off the ground and back into his neutral stance, which is a great time to use the Wight’s Spirit Attack to headbutt him for massive damage. 

![Wukong BlackWind 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ef/Wukong_BlackWind_39.jpg)

advertisement

For most of this fight, your key strategy should involve picking your moments to attack wisely, waiting for his bigger slams that take him a while to get back up and unleash your combo attacks. 

![Wukong BlackWind 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2f/Wukong_BlackWind_36.jpg)

However, once he’s at a bit less than half of his health, he’ll retreat away and let loose a roar as he slams the ground, engulfing himself in flames as several eruptions take over the arena. Dodge away from them, and if you find yourself burning, either roll repeatedly or use a cooling powder. 

![Wukong BlackWind 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e6/Wukong_BlackWind_41.jpg)  
This is also a key moment to use the Fireproof Mantle from defeating the secret boss. It will not only negate a lot of fire damage, but slowly build your focus up over time to unleash more heavy attacks in your combos. 

advertisement

![Wukong BlackWind 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e1/Wukong_BlackWind_37.jpg)

Once engulfed in flames, the Black Bear Guai will revert to his old tricks of turning into the black wind wisp and charging at you after a small explosion — only this time it will also deal fire damage. Be ready for him to zip back and forth quickly to catch you off guard. 

![Wukong BlackWind 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/88/Wukong_BlackWind_38.jpg)

advertisement

He can also pull his familiar trick of turning into mist and then reappearing with a diving bodyslam (now on fire). If you see his black wind fly up, be ready for the attack and either dodge past him or Cloud Step away and retaliate as he struggles to rise. 

When he comes at you in his bear form, all of his attacks will now deal fire damage, and all of his slams will cause explosions in front of him when his attacks hit the ground. Dodging is now more important than ever, especially to the side of his attacks to escape their explosion range. 

![Wukong BlackWind 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b9/Wukong_BlackWind_35.jpg)

Remember that you can also quickly evade his explosive slams by using the Cloud Step to teleport a short distance away, then race back into him for a Revealing Strike to deal a good amount of damage. Combo these with well-timed Immobilize to disrupt his combo attacks, and you can often knock him off balance with sustained heavy hits. 

Even with his fire damage buff, he’s not exactly immune to taking fire damage himself. If you’re in danger of being engulfed in flames and don’t have any more cooling powder, you can also use the Red Waves spell to transform, resetting your fire meter and building might to hit him with pogo jumps after dodging his attacks. 

![Wukong BlackWind 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/57/Wukong_BlackWind_40.jpg)

advertisement

This fight will last awhile, so be sure to be mindful of your stamina and back off when you need to recover, or reposition yourself if you find yourself too close to any fire pits he’s created. It’s much better to wait and find a better avenue of attack than getting too reckless and being burned as a result. 

![Wukong BlackWind 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/33/Wukong_BlackWind_42.jpg)

When he’s finally defeated, the Black Bear Guai will try and flee with the sense of the Great Sage, only for it to reject his escape attempt. As he realizes your true purpose, he’ll plead for mercy, blaming the Celestial Palace. It matters little, as the true object of your quest in the Black Wind Mountain is now yours - The Craving Eyes Relic. 

Black Bear Guai

This first Relic of the Great Sage will now appear in your inventory menu, and allow you to choose to awaken one of three passive perks: 

  * **Opportune Watcher** \- Considerably increases Focus gained on consecutive successful Light Attack hits.
  * **Eagle Eye** \- Upon a successful hit with Unveiling Strike, the Cooldown of this spell is massively reduced.
  * **Keen Insight** \- Considerably increases Critical Hit Damage.



Note that you do actually have the ability to change your decision later, in the Reignite the Sparks Menu, you’ll just need to move to the Relic Tab.

With your business concluded in Black Wind Mountain, you can enjoy the scene and tapestry that unfold after the battle, and then begin your journey into **Chapter 2: Yellow Sand, Desolate Dusk**.
