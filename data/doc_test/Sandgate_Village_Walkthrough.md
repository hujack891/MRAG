In Black Myth Wukong’s second chapter, you’ll leave behind the forests of Black Wind Mountain for the dry sands of the Yellow Wind Ridge. An energetic (yet headless) man playing a Chinese lute (known as a sanxian) will set the stage for this realm, and helpfully revive our Destined One from becoming a pincushion full of arrows.

## Yellow Wind Ridge

When you regain control, head into the stagnant shallow pool of water, where you’ll find a few Jade Lotus to harvest. Over on the right, the source of the arrows you became riddled with will become apparent, as a nearby ridge is lined with Rat Archers who will fire long salvos of flaming arrows from above. 

![Wukong Sandgate 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/34/Wukong_Sandgate_3.jpg)

Sprint past them along the water until you can find a small area to climb up onto, where a Rat Soldier will engage you from the left. Be sure to strafe around to keep the archers between you and the soldier, and bait out his shield slam before hitting him with a heavy attack to shatter his shield (the shield’s health appears as a white bar above his health bar). 

![Wukong Sandgate 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f4/Wukong_Sandgate_4.jpg)

Cross the small wooden bridge to find another Rat Soldier below the two Rat Archers, and try to lure him away and out of sight if possible. To take on the archers, make use of your Cloud Step to evade their fire and take out the top targets before working your way down, using your staff spin to deflect while waiting for your Cloud Step to recharge. Beware, as they can also toss grenades that can explode in your face with little warning. 

![Wukong Sandgate 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c6/Wukong_Sandgate_5.jpg)

A large stone arch behind the archers has a new violet Licorice plant you can harvest, and the stone stairs beyond lead to an altar with a special **Lambbrew Drink** for your Gourd. Unlike the instant heal of the Coconut Wine, it will heal a small amount at first, but a larger portion of your health bar over time. However, you’ll also find that it can only be upgraded once, compared to the multiple tiers of health increase that you can invest in the other drink. 

![Wukong Sandgate 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a0/Wukong_Sandgate_7.jpg)

Head back down to the pond, and you’ll find the waterway leads on a bit past several Croaky frog enemies, as well as a new kind of Rat standing by the shore. This Rat Governor wields an electric staff, which he can charge up and zap you from a distance with after a flourish, or perform a backwards jump to zap you in mid-air. If you take enough shock damage, you’ll reach a state where all incoming damage is doubled, so avoid these blasts at all costs and shut him down with Immobilize. 

![Wukong Sandgate 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a4/Wukong_Sandgate_8.jpg)

advertisement

Past the Rat Governor, you may see a flooded pit below with a large Toad Yaoguai, but for now it’s better to return to where the first Rat Soldier was and look for a path up into the hills that skirts this pit. 

![Wukong Sandgate 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/63/Wukong_Sandgate_9.jpg)

Keep following it along some wooden scaffolding above a ravine leading back to the pit, and you’ll see a settlement up ahead, plus the first of the Keeper’s Shrines guarded by another Rat Soldier. 

## Village Entrance

Make sure to take the time to view the new additions to the Chapter 2’s Shrines menu. Note that you can still freely fast travel back to any Shrine in Chapter 1’s Black Wind Mountain if you missed out on any secrets. The store is also selling very different items than it was in the previous chapter, and you’ll find that the selection will change based on which chapter you are in: 

Yellow Wind Ridge Shrine Shop   
---  
Antimiasma Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Shock-Quelling Powder (x6) - 180 Will | Tonifying Decoction (x3) - 360 Will |   
Mind Core (x2) - 720 Will | Silk (x2) - 600 Will | Yaoguai Core (x2) - 450 Will |   
Licorice (x5) - 120 Will | Aged Ginseng (x5) - 90 Will | Fragrant Jade Flower (x5) - 120 Will | Purple Lingzhi (x5) - 90 Will   
Fire Bellflower (x5) - 120 Will | Jade Lotus (x5) - 90 Will | |

advertisement

In addition, you’ll also have access to crafting a new set of armor since defeating the Black Wind King: The Ebongold Set, which provides better defense and a few bonuses to using your Cloud Step. Also, with the Flame Ebongold from the boss himself, you can use it and other ingredients to craft the Wind Bear Staff! 

![Wukong Sandgate 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c9/Wukong_Sandgate_11.jpg)

Before heading into the village, it’s time to finally find a use for all those plant materials you’ve been gathering. Look just beyond the shrine for a small ditch running under a wooden bridge. You can explore the left side to find a sloping path up to a green Wisp to absorb, and where a mushroom is actually a Lingzhiling creature in disguise. Watch for its poisonous attacks, and kill it to earn a large variety of mushroom items. The ditch also leads below the town’s large gate, but aside from Fragrant Jade Flower to harvest, there’s not much else down here. 

![Wukong Sandgate 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2a/Wukong_Sandgate_12.jpg)

advertisement

Follow the ditch through the opposite path under the bridge, and head right to a tunnel. Inside, apart from a green Wisp you can absorb for some Will and a mushroom to harvest, you can spot a grubby yet friendly canine deity. 

![Wukong Sandgate 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cb/Wukong_Sandgate_13.jpg)

The Xu Dog as he’s known has a problem he needs help with: A large frog has swallowed one of his medicinal formulas, and you’re just the person he’s looking for to get it back. 

### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw

The frog in question is the one you may have seen from the pond earlier, down in a large flooded pit nearby. While he has much in common with the other optional frog boss from Black Wind Mountain, he’s got a few new attacks you’ll need to prepare for. 

![Wukong Sandgate 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fe/Wukong_Sandgate_14.jpg)

advertisement

This particular boss is infused with the power of lightning, and like the Rat Governor you faced, he’ll try to shock you repeatedly until you suffer from a debuff that increases all your damage taken. Luckily, the Shrine’s shop sells a few Shock-Quelling Powder if you find yourself struggling to survive from these attacks. 

![Wukong Sandgate 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/89/Wukong_Sandgate_15.jpg)

Aside from the familiar hand slaps and ground pound he can perform in quick succession, many of his other attacks now have lightning effects, including his sweeping tongue-lash attack. You can dodge this tongue lash by dashing to the side with Cloud Step, and hit from the side for extra damage. Sometimes the tongue lash will shoot out in a straight line, so always dodge the tongue to the sides instead of backward. 

![Wukong Sandgate 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/56/Wukong_Sandgate_16.jpg)

advertisement

Be sure not to attack too much from the frog’s rear, as its quick hop mule kick can deal a ton of damage with little warning. If you see his arms cross, he’ll bloat his chest out for a frontal assault. 

![Wukong Sandgate 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cc/Wukong_Sandgate_17.jpg)

Several of its new electric attacks can deal a flurry of damage if you aren’t prepared to deal with them. The usual tell will be when the frog’s throat swells with electric energy. He will then shoot out dozens of electrified tadpoles — sometimes in a large frontal arc around him, and sometimes he’ll just spew them out and have them scatter around him. 

![Wukong Sandgate 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2b/Wukong_Sandgate_19.jpg)

advertisement

These can be incredibly hard to dodge accurately, and is a good case for using the Pillar Stance to gain height off the floor and out of reach of the electric tadpoles. 

![Wukong Sandgate 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/eb/Wukong_Sandgate_18.jpg)

If instead the frog lets loose a giant croak and raises its body up, it will summon a lightning storm that will rain down around the arena. Look for the signs of an imminent strike to dodge around them as they crash down. 

![Wukong Sandgate 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/20/Wukong_Sandgate_20.jpg)

advertisement

If you’re having trouble dealing with his many lightning attacks, remember to use Immobilize whenever you see him charge up to interrupt the attack entirely, limiting how much he can actually try to electrify you. 

![Wukong Sandgate 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/27/Wukong_Sandgate_23.jpg)

Once you defeat this frog boss, he’ll drop the Evil Repelling Medicament formula. Return it to the Xu dog back outside the pit. Not only will he reward you with 2 Evil Repelling Medicament for your trouble, but you’ll also unlock the ability to create all sorts of consumables yourself at any Shrine. With all the materials you’ve been harvesting, you can stock up on defensive, offensive, and status reducing consumables. 

Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw

![Wukong Sandgate 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/88/Wukong_Sandgate_24.jpg)

advertisement

Before leaving the area, be sure to look around the rim of the pit past where the Xu Dog was, and you can find a high ledge path leading to a small altar with a giant statue head, and a **Meditation Spot** in front of it, granting you a free Spark Skill Point. 

The Altar, Sandgate Village Meditation Spot

![Wukong Sandgate 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cd/Wukong_Sandgate_25.jpg)

Returning in the direction of the main Sandgate Village, you’ll find that the large doorway is sealed with a host of Rat Archers stationed on the roof where you can’t hit them. 

![Wukong Sandgate 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ad/Wukong_Sandgate_26.jpg)

advertisement

Instead, stay out of their range and look for a small hilltop altar to the right that holds a chest, and you can find 3x **Tiny Piece of Gold** and 2x **Silk** inside. 

Just beyond the chest, you can spot another large open plain. Head to the right and down the hill onto a long wooden walkway, where you’ll find a path leading back to where the Xu Dog was, and a green Wisp to grab for its Will. 

![Wukong Sandgate 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fc/Wukong_Sandgate_27.jpg)

Take the left path to reach the next open area where you’ll face off against both a Rat Soldier and a Rat Governor. Lure the Soldier out of range of the Governor’s lightning attacks to take them on separately, and don’t move yourself out too far, as more enemies and archers are waiting up ahead. 

![Wukong Sandgate 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/ff/Wukong_Sandgate_28.jpg)

advertisement

You should also inspect the raised altar on the wooden platform here, as you can find a turtle-shaped box that holds **Laurel Buds** inside, a new Soak for your Gourd. 

![Wukong Sandgate 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ef/Wukong_Sandgate_29.jpg)

A large door stands to the right, and in front of it is a two-headed Rat Captain. These foes are incredibly ferocious, both with their heavy blade, and their unique head combo: 

![Wukong Sandgate 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1c/Wukong_Sandgate_30.jpg)

advertisement

One head emits a smoky fog, and the other shoots fire. In reality, the blinding smoke can actually be ignited by the second head to cause huge explosions, so stay away from the smoke at all costs. 

![Wukong Sandgate 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/63/Wukong_Sandgate_31.jpg)

They can also ignite their blade to deal increased fire damage, and even defeating them is dangerous, as they’ll start spewing smoke and fire uncontrollably until they explode and damage everything around them. On the plus side, they don’t respawn, so you’ll only have to deal with the two in this area once. 

![Wukong Sandgate 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/11/Wukong_Sandgate_32.jpg)

advertisement

Putting the large door to the right on pause for a moment, turn your attention to the large valley in the opposite direction where the second Rat Captain patrols. The ridge above is crawling with multiple Rat Archers, plus another Rat Archer on the rooftop to the left will make trying to take him on a pain. 

![Wukong Sandgate 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fa/Wukong_Sandgate_33.jpg)

Instead, use Cloud Step to race past, and climb the hill to take out the archers and avoid the Soldier. 

![Wukong Sandgate 35X.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b3/Wukong_Sandgate_35X.jpg)

advertisement

Once the archers are out of the way, you can take out the stray Soldier and then defeat the Captain so he won’t respawn anymore. As for the archer on the roof, look for a high hill on a ledge where the grass comes right up to a roof you can jump to reach the rooftop, letting you defeat the archer plus another nearby on the other side. There’s even a green Wisp here to absorb for some Will. 

![Wukong Sandgate 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/95/Wukong_Sandgate_34.jpg)

With everyone around the valley pathway defeated, be sure to look back toward that doorway we aren’t opening yet. The large ruined house has a wall with an entrance from the side the Rat Captain was on, and inside you should be able to find and absorb a green Wisp for some will and recharge your Gourd. 

![Wukong Sandgate 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e1/Wukong_Sandgate_35.jpg)

advertisement

Head up the hill checking the houses. One has a Rat Soldier waiting to ambush you in the back, as well as another green Wisp inside. Higher up past where the Rat Archers were is a larger and open building with some Licorice. 

![Wukong Sandgate 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/55/Wukong_Sandgate_36.jpg)

At the top of the hill is one last shack, where you’ll find a big chest holding a **Blood of the Iron Bull** , 1 **Small Piece of Gold** , and 4 **Tiny Piece of Gold**. Plus, if you circle around the back, you can harvest a Fragrant Jade Flower. 

![Wukong Sandgate 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c8/Wukong_Sandgate_37.jpg)

advertisement

Heading back down the hill towards the path at the bottom, be sure to stop by a lone shack far apart from the others. You’ll hear some whispering as you draw close, and a voice will speak out as you interact with the shack, telling you to go away for fear the two-headed Rat Captains will find them. Keep talking with the mysterious voice, and after you’ve rid the area of captains, they’ll thank you, and mention they may go off in search of the missing Third Prince somewhere in the West. 

![Wukong Sandgate 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/09/Wukong_Sandgate_38.jpg)

Heading to the left of the lone shack, you’ll find a gate guarded by a Rat Governor and another Archer on the rooftops that connects to the one you climbed earlier. Defeat them to gain access to a large open field inside the Village’s main area. From across the field, a voice pleading to be freed calls out, but in your way is a large loping creature that will want to engage you first. 

### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Earth Wolf

This strange looking yaoguai has a lot of rushing attacks that are hard to get a sense of due to its attack patterns, and you’ll want to utilize your Immobilize spell for help interrupting these when possible. 

![Wukong Sandgate 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3f/Wukong_Sandgate_39.jpg)

advertisement

It will often start the fight with a leaping attack, using its head to ram into you as it rolls when it hits the ground. Wait until it comes crashing down to dodge, then move along with it to keep attacking as it rights itself. 

![Wukong Sandgate 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/13/Wukong_Sandgate_41.jpg)

It can also try to perform a short distance pounce to land on top of you, which moves much quicker than its headbutt leap. If you can evade this one, it will waste time looking around to find that it missed its grab, letting you get your hits in. 

However, if you get locked in the grab, you’ll be tossed up in the air and land right on its bony back and horns, taking major damage as it shakes you off. Watch for both of its paws to reach out to know when to dodge this move. 

![Wukong Sandgate 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a9/Wukong_Sandgate_40.jpg)

advertisement

The Earth Wolf can also perform two short lunging bite attacks in fairly quick succession, moving itself forward with each bite to try and lock onto you. 

![Wukong Sandgate 44.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/22/Wukong_Sandgate_44.jpg)

If you see the boss angle its head and raise its arm up, be ready for a shoulder charge dash as it slides along the ground to try and tackle you. Stick to dodging away and to the side and wait until the tackle is done to get in your counters. 

![Wukong Sandgate 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d0/Wukong_Sandgate_43.jpg)

Though it can often rise up on its hind legs to slash at you with its front claws, certain times its wild swings will make it crash forward to land belly up. After a moment it will thrash around and try to damage you if close, but with an exposed unarmored part of its body, you can try freezing it in place and expending a charged attack - preferably with the Smash or Pillar Style to slam down on its ribs for extra damage. 

You can also get an opportune strike after dodging its grab by using that moment to hit it hard with a Spirit attack from the Wandering Wight, and big enough hits can cause it to fall on its belly as well. 

![Wukong Sandgate 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ac/Wukong_Sandgate_42.jpg)

With enough damage dealt, the Earth Wolf will fall, revealing its Spirit to be claimed by you. You can look around the arena to harvest some Jade Lotus in the pond, or check the back of the houses to find other materials like Aged Ginseng. 

Earth Wolf

![Wukong Sandgate 45.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bf/Wukong_Sandgate_45.jpg)

Be sure to head on over to the altar with the tiger statue to find the source of the person calling for help — it’s the same friendly Horse Guai you may have met in Chapter 1 by a Meditation Point right after Guanyin Temple. He’ll be thankful for your arrival, but stresses that he’ll be okay and can slip out on his own. Chat him up to learn more about the rats of this region, and then take him at his word and leave him to make his own way out. 

![Wukong Sandgate 46.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9c/Wukong_Sandgate_46.jpg)

Be sure to open up the gate nearby to unlock a shortcut back to the Village Entrance. As an added bonus, all the Rat Archers posted on the gate’s roof have jumped down, and you can ambush the entire group. Your Sage’s Relic should now indicate an enemy who has a Spirit you can absorb, and sure enough you can spot a tougher Rat Archer than the rest with blue flames. Defeat him, and you’ll be able to absorb the Rat Archer Spirit. As an added bonus, all the Rat Archers will no longer spawn here! 

![Wukong Sandgate 47.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5d/Wukong_Sandgate_47.jpg)

Since they’re all gone, head through the gate the archers were guarding and stick to the right side to find a path up to a chest, which you can loot to get 1 **Small Piece of Gold** and 3 **Tiny Piece of Gold**. 

![Wukong Sandgate 48.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c8/Wukong_Sandgate_48.jpg)

Now it’s time to finally open that door the Rat Captains were guarding. In the next scene, you’ll spot the next major boss fight: a tiny Rat King and his oversized son. 

## Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince

There’s one very important thing to get out of the way before discussing the rest of the fight. Despite the name, the Rat King of Flowing Sands is not your true target, and in reality you can complete this battle as soon as you defeat his son, the Second Rat Prince. However, if you choose to engage in regicide yourself, know that the prince will become enraged at the death of his father, and will gain a massive damage increase with empowered moves. But for all this risk, there is a reward — defeating the empowered Rat Prince will allow you to absorb his Spirit to use in attacks, which you **can’t gain otherwise**! 

When the battle begins, you’ll notice that the King wisely does not try to fight you up close. He’ll scurry behind his son and out of sight while the Second Rat Prince tries to hold your attention with massive swings from his spiked mace. The King can even burrow underground, creating a trail of flying dirt as he tries to evade you. 

![Wukong Sandgate 51.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/ca/Wukong_Sandgate_51.jpg)

Left to his own devices, he’ll most often emerge to scurry up one of the five large stone pillars in this boss arena, and begin pelting you with rocks from afar. One or two rocks won’t be lethal, but he can soon start to hurl a ton your way and stagger you when you’re trying to survive against the Prince. 

![Wukong Sandgate 55.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b4/Wukong_Sandgate_55.jpg)

That said, if you keep the Prince between you and his dad, there’s a very good chance he’ll lob a rock at his son’s own head — thank goodness for friendly fire! 

![Wukong Sandgate 52.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/15/Wukong_Sandgate_52.jpg)

The easiest way to get the King to come down again is to simply lure the Second Prince over to one of the pillars. Let him strike at you wildly, and he’ll destroy the pillar and send the King toppling down to be hit. He doesn’t have much health, and has a hard time getting away, especially if you catch him some distance away from his son who can sometimes take his time closing the distance. 

![Wukong Sandgate 53.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/32/Wukong_Sandgate_53.jpg)

If you do want to do defeat the King but are worried about incurring the Prince’s wrath, a good idea is to attack the King whenever he’s exposed, but then focus your attention on taking the Prince’s health down to a manageable level so that when you defeat the King, the Prince can’t last long. 

![Wukong Sandgate 49.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/43/Wukong_Sandgate_49.jpg)

The Second Prince himself will use basic attacks like a dashing stab with the point of his spiked mace, or slam the ground in front of him repeatedly. 

![Wukong Sandgate 50.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4a/Wukong_Sandgate_50.jpg)

This usually ends with a quick wave of force as he pulls his weapon up that you’ll need to dodge, so don’t get too gutsy trying to retaliate early on this attack. 

![Wukong Sandgate 54.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a0/Wukong_Sandgate_54.jpg)

If you hear him start to yell at a distance, be prepared for a charge attack that comes with a three hit smashing sweep attack, and wait until his final attack to retaliate with your own combo attack.

Sometimes, he’ll even rear back for a quick headbutt slam, but the move will usually stagger himself, and a quick dodge will give you a lot of time to lay into him. 

![Wukong Sandgate 57.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/89/Wukong_Sandgate_57.jpg)

It’s when you kill the King that you’ll really have to start worrying. He’ll power up with blasts of wind as his mace glows hot, and will now imbue his strikes with fissures that erupt all around the impact site of his weapon! 

![Wukong Sandgate 58.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/18/Wukong_Sandgate_58.jpg)

His new charge attack has a jumping slam that will create a ring fissures all around him, which you’ll need to get away from rather than trying to counter. 

![Wukong Sandgate 59.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b5/Wukong_Sandgate_59.jpg)

His overhead slam can similarly raise a line of fissures from the strike, making dodging to the side your best bet. 

![Wukong Sandgate 61.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/01/Wukong_Sandgate_61.jpg)

Expect his swings to hit harder and move faster, often hitting twice in a row in quick succession. If he jumps through the air past you, he’ll often go for a lunging sweeping strike that sends him sliding back past you, but gives you the opportunity to dodge alongside his strike to hit him where he ends up. 

![Wukong Sandgate 60.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/24/Wukong_Sandgate_60.jpg)

Another terrifying new move is for him to do a slow spin ending with a weapon toss right at you. He’ll quickly follow up with a leaping dive attack to reach his mace, and then pull it out of the ground and swing it forth, which should quell any thoughts of trying to attack at this point. 

Ideally, the lower you have his health before killing his father, the less time you’ll have to worry about this phase if you can rush him down. If you don’t kill his dad, he’ll scurry off as soon as the Second Prince falls. If not, you’ll be able to help yourself to the Second Prince’s Spirit, as well as a Pungent Flesh Chunk. 

King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince

## Valley of Despair

![Wukong Sandgate 62.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cf/Wukong_Sandgate_62.jpg)

As the battle concludes, the lute-playing headless man will return to continue his ballad. A large imposing stone door stands before you, and a small shining statue near it can’t be interacted with unless you possess both the Sterness of Stone and Keeness of Tiger. If you listen to the headless man’s song, he’ll offer a clue: To beat the yellow rat sage who rules this place, you’ll need to defeat his henchmen who carry the keys to this door. 

From here, things can get pretty varied and more open than the paths were in Chapter 1. To the right of the sealed door is a bridge leading to the Fright Valley (plus a Ginsengling you can beat up to harvest its plants). To the left lies the Valley of Despair, and beyond it the Crouching Tiger Temple. 

![Wukong Sandgate 63.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/55/Wukong_Sandgate_63.jpg)

For this walkthrough, we’ll wrap up the last sub-region of Sandgate before diverting to Fright Valley first, and then the Crouching Tiger Temple, but you’re free to explore where you want. 

![Wukong Sandgate 64.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/be/Wukong_Sandgate_64.jpg)

You’ll find a new Shrine to rest at, not far to the left of the sealed door. Just beyond the Shrine is a cave entrance, guarded by a Rat Soldier and Rat Archer supporting him on some scaffolding. Skirt around the soldier to engage the archer first. 

![Wukong Sandgate 65.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1b/Wukong_Sandgate_65.jpg)

On the other end of the tunnel, the path will open up into a large interior valley with the sun streaming down on the left. Stick to the right side for now, and you’ll find a large door that can’t be opened from this side. 

![Wukong Sandgate 66.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0b/Wukong_Sandgate_66.jpg)

Just past the door, you can find a wooden structure built into the rock walls with a glowing pot just out of reach. To get to it, look for a ledge below you can drop down onto, and take the path right to climb back up. Break the glowing pot to gain your second **Awaken Wine Worm** to upgrade your Gourd’s Drink. Just remember you can only do so by traveling back to the Shen Monkey in Chapter 1. 

![Wukong Sandgate 68.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Wukong_Sandgate_68.jpg)

Heading back down, you’ll be attacked from a ledge by a zombie-like Blazebone. These creatures fling bones down at you, but can’t do much else so simply evade or spin your staff before jumping up to kill it. 

![Wukong Sandgate 69.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/ef/Wukong_Sandgate_69.jpg)

To the right, there’s a thin crevice filled with Fire Bellflowers to harvest. The crevice leads to a fallen rock forming a bridge to another Blazebone and Licorice, and a path leading onward. 

![Wukong Sandgate 70.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/ba/Wukong_Sandgate_70.jpg)

Before you do that, instead take a left to where the sun shines down on a large rat statue and a curved wall, as well as a large pit. The pit holds one last major boss to deal with, which can arrive in a few ways. 

### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - First Prince of Flowing Sands

![Wukong Sandgate 71.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/94/Wukong_Sandgate_71.jpg)

If you didn’t kill the King of Flowing Sands when fighting him and his second son, he’ll have snuck over here to summon his even bigger first son to beat you into a pulp (the First Prince however, will promptly deal with the King himself). If you killed both King and Prince, you can instead toss down the Pungent Flesh Chunk to rouse the Prince out of his lair. 

![Wukong Sandgate 72.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/ff/Wukong_Sandgate_72.jpg)

As a much bigger foe than the Second Prince, expect a lot of large slamming attacks in your direction. He’s a wild and unpredictable opponent, so be sure to use Cloud Step to get out of the way if you’re not sure what’s coming, then crash back into him from the sides. 

The First Prince will usually start with a lunging two-hand slam attack after he stands on his hind legs that shakes up a lot of dust, but you can dodge to the side and keep attacking as he recovers. 

![Wukong Sandgate 73.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/75/Wukong_Sandgate_73.jpg)

Other general attacks include alternating hand slams that come in 1 or 2 hit successions. He can also put his hand down to the side first, and then sweep it across the front in a slower swipe that you’ll need to dodge back from instead of moving alongside his hand. 

![Wukong Sandgate 75.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/25/Wukong_Sandgate_75.jpg)

Some scarier attacks that the First Prince can employ will have him stand up holding his arms to the side, then stumbling forward in a large swing as he topples down on his side, which covers a large area both from the arm swipe and body slam. Be sure to dodge to the side he puts his arms up and you’ll avoid him swinging in the opposite direction. 

![Wukong Sandgate 76.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5a/Wukong_Sandgate_76.jpg)

He also has a surprisingly quick lunge that’s very hard to dodge if you don’t look for the subtle cue of him slowly extending one arm backward before lunging forward with a quick sliding swipe attack. If you see it early, you can also Immobilize him to interrupt before he can perform it. 

![Wukong Sandgate 74.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/53/Wukong_Sandgate_74.jpg)

If you try dodging around and attacking from the side, be aware that he can either use a quick tail swipe to stagger you, or swing his arm back quickly to draw you away from flanking him, so don’t get too comfortable. 

Even as big as he is with a larger health pool, he’s not as ferocious as the enraged Second Prince. Do note however there is a **secret trick in this fight** : If you lure him into doing one of his larger slam attacks while your back is to the curved wall, his strikes may cause the wall to crack - revealing a secret! 

Once he’s been defeated, he’ll drop the **Arhat Gold Piece** Key Item. We'll need it for a sidequest elsewhere in this chapter. 

First Prince of Flowing Sands

### The Loong’s Secret Tomb

![Wukong RedLoong 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/02/Wukong_RedLoong_2.jpg)  
If you got lucky, the First Prince’s attacks may have formed a giant crack in the slightly rounded wall full of little statues on the side of the boss arena, forming a hole you can slide through. If you weren’t able to trigger this, don't worry. You can crack the wall yourself, but it will require a major attack, much bigger than your little monkey frame can deal out. However, specific transformations will get the job done - like the Wandering Wight’s Spirit headbutt attack, or the Azure Dust transformation spell found elsewhere in this chapter.   
![Wukong RedLoong 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fb/Wukong_RedLoong_3.jpg)

  
On the other side of the crack, you’ll enter a large tomb with a chest by a mural. It holds the Loong Scale - a very important object that allows you to access several secret bosses! 

![Wukong Sandgate 77.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/da/Wukong_Sandgate_77.jpg)

  
There’s one last bit of the Valley of Despair to search before backtracking to the next region. Climb out of the pit where the boss was to cross the fallen stone, and you’ll find a crack in the wall to sidle through. 

![Wukong Sandgate 78.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/92/Wukong_Sandgate_78.jpg)

On the other side, you’ll encounter a very strong Swift Bat. These enemies can dash at you very fast with their powerful swings to hit hard, or hit you from a distance with waves of force. This one in particular is stronger than the rest because after defeating it, you’ll gain the Swift Bat Spirit. 

![Wukong Sandgate 79.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/4e/Wukong_Sandgate_79.jpg)

A doorway to the right leads outside, but before you exit be sure to look for a barricaded doorway across from the crack in the wall that you can knock down. The outer cave here is full of debris, and two more Swift Bats to contend with. 

![Wukong Sandgate 80.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/27/Wukong_Sandgate_80.jpg)

Be sure to search to the very back of the room, behind a tiger statue, and you’ll find an altar with a pot you can open to reveal a **Celestial Nonary Pill** , increasing your maximum stamina! 

![Wukong Sandgate 82.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9e/Wukong_Sandgate_82.jpg)

Finally, exit the room where the first Swift Bat was to find a canyon path down to the [Crouching Tiger Temple](/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Crouching_Tiger_Temple "Crouching Tiger Temple"). 

![Wukong Sandgate 81.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/88/Wukong_Sandgate_81.jpg)

Due to the layout of this area and the progression of a few sidequests, we’ll be coming back here later, and continue by traveling back to where the Second Prince was defeated and crossing the bridge right to the [**Fright Cliff**](/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Fright_Cliff "Fright Cliff").
