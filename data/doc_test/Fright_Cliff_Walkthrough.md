![Wukong Sandgate 81.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/88/Wukong_Sandgate_81.jpg)

Fright Cliff is one of the two sub-regions you’ll need to explore in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong in order to unlock the large sealed doors that lead to the end of the chapter. You can first reach this area by heading through the Sandgate Village and defeating the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince, and then crossing the bridge to the right of the sealed door.

![Wukong Fright 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/97/Wukong_Fright_1.jpg)

As you cross the bridge, you can harvest some Licorice on the other side, and look to the left to spot a large archway in the distance, with a whirling black tornado even further left in a canyon separating the Fright Cliffs from the Crouching Tiger Temple. 

![Wukong Fright 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f4/Wukong_Fright_2.jpg)

Heading toward the archway in the distance, you can find a green Wisp to absorb on the left side of the broken rock pathway, and on the right is a new type of enemy that will try to ambush you. This Pitstone is a mass of rock and skulls on legs, and will try to use its weight to jump down on you, and perform somersaults to use its momentum to slam into you. If they prove to be a problem to evade, consider using the Thrust Stance to charge up attacks from a distance and shatter them. 

![Wukong Fright 3.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/df/Wukong_Fright_3.jpg)

At the foot of the large archway stands another new enemy, the Spearbone. These warriors with horse skull heads adorned with brambles are very durable enemies, and will roar before stabbing and slashing with their hefty spears. Since they are slow to hit, engage in light attack combos and watch their moments to know when to dodge or try a strike through. 

![Wukong Fright 4.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7e/Wukong_Fright_4.jpg)

advertisement

As you enter the Fright Cliff proper, another Pitstone enemy waits up the path, with a Blazebone enemy on a ledge to the right to try and pepper you with projectiles. 

![Wukong Fright 5.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/86/Wukong_Fright_5.jpg)

Make sure not to lock on and face the smaller threat, or you’ll be rammed by the Pitstone. Instead use your Cloud Step to get around and sneak attack. 

## Squall Hideout

### The First Buddha’s Eyeball

![Wukong Fright 6.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/0/0e/Wukong_Fright_6.jpg) Just up the sloping path, you should spot the smoke trail of the Fright Cliff’s Shrine up ahead, and just before it, ominous chanting. The chanting comes from a large buddha head statue in the ground, and by interacting with it, you can claim the Buddha’s Eyeball. In fact, there are six of them to find the Fright Cliff, and we’ll track them all down before long, as they can unlock a secret boss fight! 

advertisement

![Wukong Fright 7.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/90/Wukong_Fright_7.jpg)

After resting at the Shrine, you’ll have two paths - one leading into a darkened area on the left, and the brighter path along the cliffs to the right with a narrow ravine. 

![Wukong Fright 8.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5e/Wukong_Fright_8.jpg)

advertisement

If you head left first, you’ll find a small pathway where a Bladebone will spew projectiles at you from a scaffold you can’t reach, but you can duck into and find a green Wisp to absorb in a small room. 

![Wukong Fright 9.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c4/Wukong_Fright_9.jpg)

Head past the ranged attacker above (note the Aged Ginseng on the left is actually a Ginsengling), and go through a doorway to spy a large cave entrance up ahead. Stick to the right to find a sloping path back, and a new stony enemy variant will burrow out of the ground. 

![Wukong Fright 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f0/Wukong_Fright_10.jpg)

advertisement

Palestones, like Pitstones, are durable bulky enemies who will try to spin and bash into you with their sharp quartz shells to deal a lot of damage. Even worse, they’ll shake violently to shoot quartz projectiles out around them, and then target you even at a distance. Luckily, a charged hardy smack can severely wound them, so keep your distance and strafe until charged to cut them down to size. 

![Wukong Fright 11.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9a/Wukong_Fright_11.jpg)

Look at the top of the ridge near where the Palestone emerged, and you can find a chest to open above the doorway you came through that holds 1 **Small Piece of Gold** and 3 **Tiny Piece of Gold**. Nearby, you can also find a wooden walkway taking you along the scaffolding that leads to the ranged Bladeblone that was harassing you earlier so you can deal with it. 

![Wukong Fright 12.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/9e/Wukong_Fright_12.jpg)

advertisement

The large cave entrance has a few paths, with the outer one on the right leading past another Pitstone to a wooden coffin chest holding 3 **Silk** and some **Will**. 

### The Second Buddha’s Eyeball

![Wukong Fright 13.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/31/Wukong_Fright_13.jpg)  
Ignore the middle path leading into the main cave entrance for the moment, and head toward the large open cave area to the left by following some braziers. They’ll lead toward a large ominous statue in the dark. More Palestones will try to ambush you here, and they guard another stone statue head at the foot of the larger statue’s altar. Examine it to gain another Buddha’s Eyeball. 

![Wukong Fright 14.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bd/Wukong_Fright_14.jpg)

advertisement

Head back to the Squall Hideout Shrine, and this time stay out in the sun to explore the other half of this area. The far right side has several enemies patrolling around, including a shield-bearing Spearbone that has a lot more defense than the Rat Soldier. You’ll want to chip away at the shield with charged heavy strikes until he’s defenseless before Immobilizing him, and dodging the shield charges and bashes. 

![Wukong Fright 15.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/62/Wukong_Fright_15.jpg)

Look for a large sloping path upward on the far side of the valley that’s guarded by a Blazebone on a ledge, and head past to find a lone Pitstone by the cliff edge that guards another wooden chest. Open it and you’ll find a **Mind Core** , 3 **Silk** , and more **Will**. 

![Wukong Fright 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b1/Wukong_Fright_16.jpg)

advertisement

Returning back down the slope, you’ll find a small crevice cutting through the area, with ruins above on the right. Stick to these ruins for the moment so you don’t get ambushed by ranged attackers when exploring the crevice. 

![Wukong Fright 17.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/b3/Wukong_Fright_17.jpg)

Start by luring the shieldless Spearbone out of range of the Blazebones above, then climb the stairs to rush down the projectile throwers. Be sure to look at the ruined home at the first landing below the first Blazebone for a yellow chest that has 2 **Yaoguai Core** and 3 **Tiny Piece of Gold**. 

### The Third Buddha’s Eyeball

![Wukong Fright 18.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fd/Wukong_Fright_18.jpg)  
Fight your way to the top of the stairs and keep staff spinning to deflect the ranged attacks until all the Blazebones are dead. At the end of this high raised wooden platform you’ll find another of the giant statue heads, allowing you to take its Buhdda’s Eyeball. 

advertisement

![Wukong Fright 19.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/f3/Wukong_Fright_19.jpg)

As you grab the eye, you may hear someone calling out to you from down below. Backtrack down to the crevice entrance, and head under the bridge, while watching for ambushes by a new stone enemy variant. The Poisestone is a much smaller and more agile version of the Palestone, able to dash around and expel poison projectiles. Defeating it will remove the stone body, but the legs will survive, and start to deploy devastating kicks if you don’t lock them down and destroy them. 

![Wukong Fright 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/28/Wukong_Fright_20.jpg)

advertisement

At the end of the crevice, you’ll find an unusual looking stone. He’s actually a Man-in-Stone, and claims to have been trapped within the rock form. He’s betting on one of the rock guai in the large cave nearby to hold the secrets to reversing his fate, and asks you to seek it out. 

### The Fourth Buddha’s Eyeball

![Wukong Fright 21.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/32/Wukong_Fright_21.jpg)  
As you leave the crevice with the Man-in-Stone, stick to the left wall going up to find several paths leading toward the large cave. Halfway up this sloping path just above where the Man-in-Stone is in the crevice below, you’ll find another of the large stone heads chanting, and can claim it’s Buddha’s Eyeball. 

![Wukong Fright 22.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/21/Wukong_Fright_22.jpg)

advertisement

Now take one of the side paths to return to the large cave entrance, and look for a tunnel with some torches and a faint green light. The dark cave tunnel holds a green Wisp you can absorb to refill a bit of your Gourd, but beware, as the place is the perfect ambush spot. 

![Wukong Fright 23.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/68/Wukong_Fright_23.jpg)

Advance cautiously to spy a Poisestone and two Bladebones on some scaffolding awaiting your arrival. Use Cloudstep to ambush the weaker enemies first, then slam into the Poisestone with a charged hit to put it down. 

![Wukong Fright 24.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/df/Wukong_Fright_24.jpg)

advertisement

Near this defensive outpost is another tunnel exit, and you can step out quickly to find a Spearbone with a shield, who guards the outdoor path that connects back down to the crevice. Back in the cave, you can check the left wall to find another green Wisp to absorb, and note the golden trail of a nearby Shrine at another tunnel exit up ahead. It’s not a bad idea to activate and rest at this **Rockrest Flat Shrine** first, considering the quest we still have to finish the cave first that can be tough. 

![Wukong Fright 25.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/dd/Wukong_Fright_25.jpg)

Look for the continuing cave path left of the exit that heads up a grassy slope, and collect the Fire Bellflower before you reach an open area with a Poisetone seemingly praying at an altar on the left with a green Wisp. 

![Wukong Fright 26.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/11/Wukong_Fright_26.jpg)

advertisement

You’ll soon be ambushed by another Poisestone nearby, but this one is wreathed in blue flames and is much stronger. On the plus side, defeating it will earn you the Poisestone Spirit to transform into! 

![Wukong Fright 27.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/ac/Wukong_Fright_27.jpg)

At the end of the cave path, you’ll find the object of the Man-in-Stone’s quest - an even larger statue embedded with shining blue crystals. Don’t get too enraptured that you miss a Poisestone along the walls trying to ambush you, though. 

### The Fifth Buddha’s Eyeball

![Wukong Fright 33.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7f/Wukong_Fright_33.jpg)  
Upon reaching the end of the large cave system where you’ll find the Mother of Stones, look for a large opening to the right to exit back outside and onto a cliff edge. There’s a raised platform here, and you’ll find another statue head to harvest its Buddha Eyeball.

### Yaoguai Chief Mini-Boss Fight - Mother of Stones

![Wukong Fright 28.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/63/Wukong_Fright_28.jpg)

This boss battle is an interesting one, simply because the giant crystal-embedded statue known as the Mother of Stones doesn’t actually fight you. It doesn’t really move at all, but it has a lot of health to slowly chip through. 

What will fight you, however, is the army of Palestones you can spot embedded in the ground and walls all around you. Make no mistake, this will be an endurance battle, as you’ll need to survive repeated encounters with more and more Palestones. 

![Wukong Fright 29.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/ff/Wukong_Fright_29.jpg)

advertisement

After taking enough damage, the Mother of Stones will let out a roar, signaling a Palestone will quickly appear to defend her. That’s your cue to immediately break off your attack, regain your stamina, and be ready to dodge the incoming stone monster. Survival will hinge on how well you can deal with each wave while taking minimal damage, and understanding their melee and ranged attacks. 

![Wukong Fright 30.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/d/d1/Wukong_Fright_30.jpg)

Once you’ve defeated two waves of single Palestones each, the third wave will consist of two Palestones at the same time. This can be a huge problem fast if they gang up on you with alternating attacks. Deflecting their ranged quartz missiles isn’t too bad… until you’re also dealing with one trying to body slam you. 

This is the time to use everything in your arsenal to stay alive. Make sure you’re using your Spirit attacks to focus fire a target, unleash any stored Focus Points, and use Immobilize or Cloud Step to stay out of danger. 

![Wukong Fright 31.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7e/Wukong_Fright_31.jpg)

advertisement

There’s one last wave of two after this, for a total of six Palestones for the whole fight. Again, don’t hold back, and use your Transformation Spell to power down at least one of the enemies as quickly as possible so you aren’t overwhelmed. Don’t be afraid to back well off and heal to stay out of range of their projectiles. 

![Wukong Fright 32.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/1e/Wukong_Fright_32.jpg)

Once all six Palestones are down, there’s nothing left that the Mother of Stones can do, so keep smacking it until the boss breaks apart. You’ll be awarded the **Stone Essence** Key Item, as well as some Stone Spirits and Yaoguai Cores. 

Mother of Stones

Rest up, and then return to the Man-in-Stone. You may want to also clear out the Bladebones above him just so they don’t harass you as you try to turn in the Stone Essence. 

![Wukong Fright 34.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Wukong_Fright_34.jpg)

advertisement

Once you hand it over, the Man-in-Stone will burst out of the ground and declare you gullible for just giving it to him. That’s not very nice, and it sounds like he deserves a beatdown. 

![Wukong Fright 35.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/32/Wukong_Fright_35.jpg)

While he technically has a boss health bar and everything, he’s kind of a pushover, barely having much more health than a regular Pinstone, and only doing their regular attacks anyway. Simply Immobilize him, rack up some Focus Points, and deliver a charged strike to send him packing. 

![Wukong Fright 36.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/51/Wukong_Fright_36.jpg)

advertisement

Realizing the error of his ways, the Man-in-Stone will promptly burrow right back in the ground and plead for mercy. You’ll then be able to re-harvest the Stone Essence from him, which will turn into the **Azure Dust Transformation Spell**! Finally, the slow yet sturdy power of the Rock Guai is yours to command in battle! 

Man-in-Stone

Unlike the Red Waves wolf transformation, you’ll be extremely slow, unable to dodge, and overall be a pretty big target. On the plus side, you’ll be immune to all status effects while transformed, and deal incredible damage that staggers most enemies. Instead of Might building on attack, you’ll build it while taking damage, allowing you to soak blows and unleash a powerful jump attack spell in return! 

As an added bonus, if you keep hassling the Man-in-Stone, he’ll promise to prepare wares to sell the next time you visit. Be sure to take him up on this offer, as he’ll have a decent selection of (very high-priced) goods! 

Man-in-Stone's Shop

## Rockrest Flat

The area of Rockrest flat is wide with three major branches from the open area around the Shrine, and all directions are worth noting. 

![Wukong Fright 37.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/54/Wukong_Fright_37.jpg)

To the right when facing the shrine, you can spot stairs leading up past a wooden platform where a Blazebone will attack from its vantage point. 

![Wukong Fright 40.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/e7/Wukong_Fright_40.jpg)

advertisement

Up the stairs, a Spearbone with shield guards a spot with a large waterfall of sand. The Spearbone is tougher than average, because defeating him will allow you to claim the Spearbone Spirit to add to your arsenal of transformation attacks! Just beware of his roar that preludes a frenzied combo of spear swings and slams, and use your Immobilize or Cloud Step to skirt around his defenses and attack him instead of his shield. 

![Wukong Fright 41.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a1/Wukong_Fright_41.jpg)

Taking a closer look at the sandfall behind this enemy, you’ll find that its actually a magic barrier that can be dispelled, but only if you were able to crack the wall near the First Prince of Flowing Sand and find the Loong Scales. Once you have them, you’ll be able to interact with the sandfall and remove it, opening a door to a very tough secret boss fight - the Black Loong. Due to its difficulty, and some ways to make the fight easier you’ll unlock later, we recommend saving him for later. 

![Wukong Fright 39.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7e/Wukong_Fright_39.jpg)

Head back down the stairs from the waterfall of sand and keep to the right to take down more Spearbones and assorted Rock Guai until you reach an opening in the cliff walls with a small wooden fencing you can break open. 

![Wukong Fright 59.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/8c/Wukong_Fright_59.jpg)

In this large open field, you’ll find a friendly boar-like Guai resting on a rock. He’s apparently extremely inebriated, and needs you to help him find something to sober him up. He’ll mention “Windrest” if you talk to him again, providing a clue to where you can find such an ingredient. However, you’ll also find that the Man-in-Stone sells a Sobering Stone if you don’t want to explore. Since it costs a hefty 6,480 Will, you’re better off waiting to continue his questline when we explore the Yellow Wind Formation later on. 

![Wukong Fright 60.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/b/bd/Wukong_Fright_60.jpg)

Be sure to look around the vast field for items to gather like Fire Bellflower and Fragrant Jade Flowers. If you travel to the edge of the cliff past the field, you can find a **Meditation Point** by a large curved tree, giving you a free Skill Point! 

Deadwood Forest, Rockrest Flat Meditation Spot

The only other part of this field has a large gate that can’t currently be opened, so instead it’s time to return to the Shrine. 

### The Sixth Buddha’s Eyeball

![Wukong Fright 38.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/67/Wukong_Fright_38.jpg)  
From the Shrine at Rockrest Flat, look off to the left for a path leading to a large opening in the rocks. Just before the path opens up, you can find the final statue head, and claiming its eyes will cause a mantra to be chanted, “Om Mani Padme Hum”, confirming you’ve found the final eye! 

![Wukong Fright 42.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/cb/Wukong_Fright_42.jpg)

Just past this final Buddha statue head, look through the archway opening in the rocky wall. Ahead you’ll spot a group of stone floating in the air, signaling your next boss fight is at hand. There's also a strange large rock to the left - make a note of it and we'll inspect it later. 

## Yaoguai King Boss Fight - Stone Vanguard

The Stone Vanguard is one of two bosses you must defeat to advance to the end of Chapter 2, and defeating it is no easy task. As a hulking monster of rock, the Stone Vanguard employs lots of tremor attacks and huge shockwaves whenever it slams its giant front arms down — which is most of the time. Cloud Step can be very useful for getting out of the way of incoming leaps, and then blindsiding it from the side to stagger it off of its current attack. 

![Wukong Fright 43.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/7/7b/Wukong_Fright_43.jpg)

### Secret - Get Help from the Shigandang

![Wukong Shigandang 1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/e/eb/Wukong_Shigandang_1.jpg)  
If you find yourself having trouble with the [Stone Vanguard](/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Stone_Vanguard "Stone Vanguard"), it is possible to [get some assistance from the most unlikely source: Another Yaoguai King](/wikis/black-myth-wukong/How_to_Defeat_the_Stone_Vanguard_With_Another_Boss "How to Defeat the Stone Vanguard With Another Boss") found in the same boss arena.  
![Wukong Shigan Secret1.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/4/49/Wukong_Shigan_Secret1.jpg)

  
If you've collected all six Buddha Eyeballs, you can actually interact with the large rock to the left before engaging the Stone Vanguard. This will summon the mighty [Shigandang](/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Shigandang "Shigandang") boss to arise and immediately fight with the Stone Vanguard. The good news is he's a lot tougher than the Stone Vanguard, and will perform a flashy finisher to tear the other rock Guai to pieces, giving you all the rewards!  
![Wukong Shigandang 2.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/6/60/Wukong_Shigandang_2.jpg)

  
The bad news is once the Stone Vanguard is gone, the Shigandang will turn on you, and he is an extremely tough boss to fight this early, so only do this if you really don't want to fight the Stone Vanguard yourself! You can also resummon the Shigandang later for a fairer matchup once you've gotten stronger. 

When the fight starts you’ll need to watch out for an incoming leaping strike with one of its front arms, which it will usually follow up by rearing up and then slamming down with both arms pulled out around its front. 

![Wukong Fright 45.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/a/a8/Wukong_Fright_45.jpg)

It’s these major slamming attacks you’ll need to be extra careful, and watch closely for when its front arms begin to glow. These types of attacks mean his arms will soon have a delayed detonation, and are designed to bait you into countering early and getting caught in the blast. Instead, hang back and use the Thrust Stance if possible to unleash a charged hit from a safe distance to the side, as the detonation will also trigger rocks to rip upwards in front of him. 

![Wukong Fright 47.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/34/Wukong_Fright_47.jpg)

While the explosion and rocky spikes can be dodged with good timing — it’s also possible to negate the effect by using your charged Pillar Stance. When done at a reasonable distance, you’ll simply ignore the tremor below you, and can follow up with a charged strike that often staggers the monster. However, if you try to create a pillar too close to his hands, the explosion can send you tumbling, though it usually absorbs the damage. 

![Wukong Fright 44.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/1/13/Wukong_Fright_44.jpg)

In an alternative attack, he’ll slam down with both arm points straight up, meaning the detonation will cover a larger wide circle on all sides of him, instead of just a frontal cone. Again, you can use the Pillar Stance with enough lead time to heft yourself over the tremor and attack from above. 

![Wukong Fright 48.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/27/Wukong_Fright_48.jpg)

If you watch him raise both arms to the side in a half-swing motion, he’ll begin to stab the ground repeatedly, alternating his arms four times, before raising both arms high for a ground-bursting blast with both of his arms.

Finally, the Stone Vanguard has a rather unique attack signaled by him tapping the ground repeatedly with one arm. This will summon a horde of Rock Guai to burrow up out of the ground and launch themselves at you in a steady succession, exploding on impact. You’ll need to either backpedal and take evasive action, or use Cloud Step to get the slip on them. Be warned that as the last two make their leap attack, the Stone Vanguard will join in requiring you to time your evasion right.

You can also try transforming into the Rock Guai yourself with the Azure Dust. Just remember that you only build Might by getting hit, and the slow pace of his attacks may make that hard unless he’s going for his more rapid arm stamping attack. If you do get a full Might bar, you can unleash a devastating “Rockfall” attack that will take off a good deal of this bosses health bar! 

Defeating the Stone Vanguard will reward you with the Sterness of Stone, one half of the items you need to activate the tallies that unlock the large door to the chapter’s main boss. 

Stone Vanguard

Note - This arena is actually home to more than one boss, and it’s hiding in plain sight. Near the entrance you came in through the large archway, there’s a large stone on the side, and on closer inspection has many heads carved into it. Draw close, and you’ll be able to interact with it, inserting the six Buddha Eyeballs you gained from the statue heads around the Fright Cliff. Doing so will unlock the Shigandang secret boss battle. It’s a much tougher fight than the Stone Vanguard, and we recommend saving it for the tail end of this chapter, either after you’ve cleared it or are close to doing so.

Just beyond the arena where you fought the Stone Vanguard, you can find a new Shrine to rest at. Defeating the Stone Vanguard will unlock a new armor set to craft: The Galeguard Set, which will grant you certain bonuses when utilizing Perfect Dodges.

Head down the path to find a row of shacks, and an opening you can head through on the left filled with a few zombie-like Withered Corpses that can lunge at you, but otherwise move fairly slow. The yard behind this hut has a Ginsengling you can defeat for extra materials.

Further down the main path, you’ll find a large terrace overlooking a ravine below where the black tornado swirls. Guarding this spot is a bolstered Rat Governor, who uses deadly lightning attacks (and can even create temporary copies of himself for added damage!) you’ll want to shut down by Immobilizing him. Defeat this stronger foe, and you’ll be able to absorb the Rat Governor Spirit to perform your own electric attack! 

![Wukong Fright 53.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/9/93/Wukong_Fright_53.jpg)

Just beyond where the Rat Governor was guarding, you can find a **Meditation Spot** down a short flight of stairs that overlooks the ravine, granting you a free Skill Point for resting here.

To proceed, head back up the stairs and take a left where a group of braziers are. In the middle of this path is a small altar with a yellow pot, and inside you’ll find a **Celestial Taiyi Pill** , raising your maximum Mana once more by a considerable amount! 

Yellow Wind Ridge Celestial Taiyi Pill

Past this upgrade, the path will begin to slope down, and quite suddenly you may find yourself slipping and sliding down a one way sandy slope into a new sub-region. It’s worth getting the Shrine at the bottom of this area, but you’ll also need to dodge a lot of Rat Archers that you won’t be able to reach. 

![Wukong Fright 55.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/3/3e/Wukong_Fright_55.jpg)

As you slide, try to angle yourself to the left, and you can find a large structure that you can jump to. 

![Wukong Fright 56.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/8/83/Wukong_Fright_56.jpg)

Clear out the archers as best you can and look for some Fragrant Jade Flowers to harvest (plus a green Wisp to absorb on the far side of the upper ridge) before dropping down to the bottom floor of the structure. 

![Wukong Fright 58.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c0/Wukong_Fright_58.jpg)

At the base of a large statue here, you can find a chest to open containing a **Blood of the Iron Bull** , 1 **Small Piece of Gold** , and 4 **Tiny Piece of Gold**. 

Hop back onto the sands and slide past the rest of the Rat Archers until you reach the bottom of the Ravine. It’s here you’ll find another of the large stone doors that requires both items from the Vanguard bosses to proceed, and you may only have one by this point. 

![Wukong Fright 57.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/c/c1/Wukong_Fright_57.jpg)

The good news is that as you approach, the headless musician will appear once more, and this time he has a gift for you: **The Pluck of Many**. You may have been able to try it out during the Prologue — this spell allows you to summon several copies of yourself to fight alongside you for a short duration. The copies don’t have much health and it costs a lot of mana to use, but they’ll help you overwhelm enemies in a pinch! 

After resting at the Windseal Gate Shrine, it’s time to fight the other Vanguard at the [**Crouching Tiger Temple**](/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Crouching_Tiger_Temple "Crouching Tiger Temple"), and we’ll return back to the [Yellow Wind Formation](/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Yellow_Sand_Formation "Yellow Sand Formation") area soon enough.
