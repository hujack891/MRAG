Q:Where to Find Captain Lotus-Vision?

A:
Captain Lotus-Vision is one of the four captains you can find in Chapter 3, and is an optional Yaoguai Chief you can encounter in the Pagoda Realm. 

To find him, you'll need to reach the Upper Pagoda Shrine on the third level of the prison. Just behind the shrine, there is a pit with purple light emanating below that you can drop into and find this boss.
