Q: Where is the location of the Apramana Bat?

A:
The Apramana Bat can be found along the snowy lake-front in the New West. After exploring Turtle Island and finding yourself on the North Shore of the Bitter Lake, continue down the waterfront until you come across the Apramana Bat near the skeleton of a great snake. The Apramana Bat won't be immediately obvious, but it will slam down to the ground once you get too close.
