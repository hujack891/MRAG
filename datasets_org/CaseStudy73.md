Q:Where to Find Captain Kalpa-Wave?

A:
Captain Kalpa-Wave is one of the four captains you can find in Chapter 3, and is one of two that are required to defeat to progress the story.

To find him, you'll need to make your way through the Valley of Ecstasy after crossing the Bitter Lake, and head through the Path of Longevity toward the large pagoda tower rising above the New Thunderclap Temple in the distance.

As you approach, a large bloody miasma will block your advance. Once it congeals, you'll find yourself facing the last of the four captains.
