As the boss falls, the Keeper will comment on the two fallen Yaoguai Guangmou and Guangzhi. Both monks apparently aided an Elder named Jinchi to burn down the temple and the monk within alive — but that’s not all they share: Just up the sloping stairway path to the left of the way forward, you can find a second large bell that you can ring.
