**Evergreen**|  Might decay is reduced   
**Ferocious Form**|  Attack is increased while Transformed

When you're transformed, you want the Transformation to last as long as possible and deal as much damage as you can. The combination of Moon Roam, Evergreen, and Ferocious Form will allow you to do just that.
