The next Celestial Jade Lotus Pill to find is hidden in the Flaming Mountains. This pill is accessible after defeating the Quick as Fire and Fast as Wind bosses. Once you do, follow the light to reach the nearby Ashen Pass II Keeper's Shrine. You will find it in a chest in a small stone alcove just opposite the Shrine.
