Q:Where is the Wukong Cat Eye Beads Location?

A:
The Cat Eye Beads can be found by killing the Wandering Wight in the [Forest of Wolves](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Forest_of_Wolves_Walkthrough) \- Outside the Forest Shrine area in [Black Wind Mountain](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Chapter_1_-_Black_Cloud,_Red_Fire). The Wight is located along the main path towards Guanyin Temple. 

You need to defeat the [Wandering Wight](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Wandering_Wight "Wandering Wight") before ringing all three bells in Black Wind Mountain and killing [Elder Jinchi](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Elder_Jinchi "Elder Jinchi"). This secret boss in the [Ancient Guanyin Temple](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Chapter_1_Secret_-_Ancient_Guanyin_Temple_Walkthrough) will despawn the Wandering Wight, making the Beads unobtainable. You can also grab the [Wandering Wight Spirit](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Wandering_Wight_Spirit) here too upon defeating him. 

The Wandering Wight acts as a skill check boss early in the game, so don't be afraid to come back after you have levelled up, just don't kill Elder Jinchi.
