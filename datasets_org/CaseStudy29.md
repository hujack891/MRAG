When you've beaten the [Rusty-Gold Cart](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Rusty-Gold_Cart "Rusty-Gold Cart") approach the frozen-over entrance and break through to head inside. 

This doorway will take you to the chapter's secret area called the Bishui Cave. We'd recommend completing this before you finish up the chapter. But there's one last miniboss to fight before you teleport to the secret area.

As you head inside the cave, go down the slope. You'll see a large structure in the center of the room that's being hit by the light. This is what will teleport you to Bishui Cave, but first, you'll want to look to the left. Here you can find the fifth of the frog bosses in the game, called Baw-Lang-Lang.
