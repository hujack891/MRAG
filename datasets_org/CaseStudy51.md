Q:What is the Bronze Cloud Staff?

A:
The Bronze Cloud Staff is another basic weapon you get at the beginning of Black Myth: Wukong. However, it is exclusive to the Deluxe Edition of the game. It comes with slightly improved stats compared to the [Willow Wood Staff](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Willow_Wood_Staff "Willow Wood Staff"). Despite that, before long you will want to switch to one of the other [Weapons](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Weapons "Weapons") when you get them due to its low damage. 

The weapon has a 36 damage stat, with a decent 2% Critical Hit Chance. While it doesn't have a unique effect, the damage and critical hit chance can give you a slight edge at this point in the game.
