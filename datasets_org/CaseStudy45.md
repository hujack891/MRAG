This Spirit is entirely missable if you get to the end of Chapter 1 without picking it up, but you'll also likely encounter it before you've got your Gourd. Thankfully, you can pick it up from the nearest Keeper's Shrine once you've got the Gourd, and we'd recommend you do so because it's a great one to have equipped especially in the early game. 

The Wandering Wight provides a substantial buff to your defence, which can make all the difference in fights. Not only this, but its Faithful Kowtow special attack allows you to deal a chunk of damage by smashing the giant's head into an enemy.
