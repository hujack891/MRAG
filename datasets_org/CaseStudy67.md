Q:Where to Find the Buddha's Right Hand?

A:
The Buddha's Right Hand is an main boss and non-missable encounter that you'll find exploring the massive Webbed Hollow Portion of Chapter 4. After descending down to the Vedure Bridge Shrine and defeating the Centipede Guai in the Bonevault, follow the linear path up to the Cliff of Oblivion. 

Just past the Shrine, you'll find a narrow passageway with a creepy hand holding a mirror, but this is actually the boss fight you seek!
