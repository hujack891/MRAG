Q:Where to Use the Buddha's Eyeball in Black Myth: Wukong?

A:
If you have collected all the Buddha's Eyeballs, you won't have to travel far to use them. On your left, from the Rockrest Flat Shrine, you can find the Rock Clash Platform arena. This arena will initially spawn the [Stone Vanguard](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Stone_Vanguard "Stone Vanguard") boss, but if you use the Buddha's Eyeballs on the rock in the arena, you will also spawn the [Shigandang](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Shigandang "Shigandang") boss.

You can actually spawn Shigandang alongside the Stone Vanguard and have them fight each other to knock out two birds with one stone. But, you can also fight them individually. 

Defeating the Stone Vanguard will give you the [Sterness of Stone](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Sterness_of_Stone "Sterness of Stone") Key Item needed to progress through Yellow Wind Ridge using the Tallies. Defeating Shigandang will give you the [Skanda of Feeling](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Skanda_of_Feeling "Skanda of Feeling \(page does not exist\)") Key Item.
