Q:Where is the Charface Location?

A:
You will come across Charface naturally as you make your way up the mountain. He can be found lurking inside a cave near the Heart of Ember Keeper's Shrine. To get there, head forward after defeating the [Father of Stones Spirit](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Father_of_Stones_Spirit "Father of Stones Spirit") and run through the gate on the right. The cave is at the bottom of the path.
