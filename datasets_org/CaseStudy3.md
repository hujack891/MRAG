Q: Where is the location of the Amber Prayer?

A:
The Amber Prayer Beads can be found in the [Flaming Mountains](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Chapter_5_-_Golden_Child,_Crimson_Blood). It is along the Gray-Bronze Cart path during the Woods of Ember. You will find yourself in a cave along this path. Within the cave you can find a path with some lava on the right. Ignore the left path.
