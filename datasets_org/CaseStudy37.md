The Beetle Captain Spirit allows you to take the form of the Beetle and soar up into the air before flying towards your foe and slashing at it with your swords. This move can deal a decent amount of damage and allows you to potentially evade attacks while you fly upward. Having the Beetle Captain equipped boosts your Stamina as well, allowing you to sprint farther, jump more, and land more combos.
