The Celestial Jade Lotus Pill in Chapter 2 is hidden deep within the Crouching Tiger Temple. To reach it, you must defeat both the Tiger Vanguard and Stone Vanguard to collect the Sternness of Stone and Keenness of Tiger items. Place those items in the Tally in the Crouching Tiger Temple arena to open a secret door leading to the Cellar. 

The Celestial Jade Lotus Pill can be found in a golden chest on the left wall of the Cellar.
