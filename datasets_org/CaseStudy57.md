Q:How to Find the Brown-Iron Cart?

A:
After defeating the [Pale-Axe Stalwart](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Pale-Axe_Stalwart "Pale-Axe Stalwart"), go up the stairs and begin your ascent of the mountain. At the top of these steps, the health bar for the Brown-Iron Cart will appear and you can find it blocking the path to the left. However, there's also a broken set of stairs to the immediate right, which you can climb up. This will bring you to a small roof you can run along to collect a green Wisp.

Dash up the broken steps and run along the small path to get behind the cart. Drop down and you'll also be at the next Keeper's Shrine.
