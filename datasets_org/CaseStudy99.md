Q:Where is the Civet Sergeant Location?

A:
The Civet Sergeant is lurking in the depths of the Crouching Tiger Temple. After defeating both the Tiger Vanguard and Stone Vanguard bosses, head back to the temple with your Keenness of Tiger and Keenness of Stone items and place them in the receptacle near the sculpture at the back of the boss arena.

This will open a secret door in the pool of blood that leads you to the Civet Sergeant in the Crouching Tiger Temple Cellar.
