Chen Loong is an optional opponent who has their own quest, which you can find shortly after leaving Turtle Rock for the North Shore of the Bitter Lake. From the Shrine, head left while facing it to head along the lakeshore toward a lone shack by the water. 

Search the shallows near this shack, and you'll find the old dragon wandering the waters, and will become hostile as you approach.
