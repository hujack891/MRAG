Since the Bullguard is a required miniboss, he can't be missed on your journey through the opening areas of Chapter 1. You'll find him in the Forest of Wolves, not far from the Front Hills Shrine just along the main path across a bridge, keeping to the right. The Bullguard blocks a large gate area leading to the next main region of Black Wind Mountain.
