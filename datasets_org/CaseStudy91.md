You can find the first Celestial Jade Lotus Pill after defeating Lingxuzi at Guanyin Temple. Once you've defeated Lingxuzi, head straight through the temple on the opposite side of the arena and turn left. There, you will find the Celestial Jade Lotus Pill in a small golden chest sitting on a table.
