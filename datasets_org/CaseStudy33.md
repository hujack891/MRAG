Q: Where is the location of Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang Location?

A:
Once you reach the Snake Trail Keeper's Shrine, run up the stairs on the right and take a left. You will come across a flimsy fence on the edge of a cliff on the left. Smash the fence and drop into the river below. Run to the right to find Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang.
