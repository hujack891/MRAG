Q:What is the Best Strand Skills to Unlock?

A:
Skill Name | Description   
---|---  
**Harmony**|  Gain Focus for each attack by Duplicates   
**Volition**|  Duplicates can use other spells like Ring of Fire, Rock Solid, and Immobilize   
  
You'll want to spend Sparks increasing the duration, health, and attack power of your Duplicates first and then try to make them as useful as possible. 

To do this, we'd suggest getting Harmoy and Volition. This will allow them the freedom to perform spells and have an effect on enemies, and also grant you Focus while they attack.
