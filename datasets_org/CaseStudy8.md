Q: What is the location of Wukong Ashen Slumber?

A:
The Ashen Slumber spell can be found in the first cell within the [Pagoda Realm](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Pagoda_Realm_Walkthrough), near the Lower Pagoda Shrine in [The New West](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Chapter_3_-_White_Snow,_Ice_Cold). However, you will need to interact with the hut in Sandgate Village - Village Entrance, just next to the entrance to the Valley of Despair Shrine area. Its on the first incline up the hill by that large door to the Shrine area.

From there, in The New West, you will need to defeat [Captain Lotus-Vision](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Captain_Lotus-Vision "Captain Lotus-Vision") in a secret area by the Upper Pagoda Shrine. Defeating him will give you [The Spirit of Captain Lotus-Vision](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/The_Spirit_of_Captain_Lotus-Vision "The Spirit of Captain Lotus-Vision") which will deactivate the purple enchantment on the gates in the Pagoda Realm.
