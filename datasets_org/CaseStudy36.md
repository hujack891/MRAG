Q:Where is the location of the Beetle Captain?

A:
The Beetle Captain can be found guarding a single chest in a small clearing in the Webbed Hollow. To get there, reach the Upper Hollow Keeper's Shrine and run up the stairs right next to it. Turn right and start making your way down the path into the caves beyond. It will take a decent amount of time to get there, but if you stick to the right, you will reach the Beetle Captain eventually.
