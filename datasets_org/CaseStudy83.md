Q:Where is the location of Wukong Celestial Lotus Seeds?

A:
The Celestial Lotus Seeds Soak in Black Myth: Wukong can be found in [Bamboo Grove](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Bamboo_Grove_Walkthrough) \- Marsh of White Mist Shrine in [Black Wind Mountain](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Chapter_1_-_Black_Cloud,_Red_Fire) after talking to the Shen Monkey Vendor upon freeing him from the enemy attacking him. 

This is along the main path when you are making your way through the area, so you can't miss him. Once you free him, enter his shop screen and you will be able to choose the Celestial Lotus Seeds.
