Q:What is the Best Alteration Skills to Unlock?

A:
Skill Name | Description   
---|---  
**Concealed Observation**|  Critical Hit Chance after Unveiling Strike is increased by talent level (can stack up to 10 times)   
**Thunder Strike**|  When in Cloud Step, Unveiling Strike can be a charged Heavy Attack   
**Rock Mastery**|  Reduces the cooldown of the spell   
**Ironclad**|  Damage Reduction given after a Deflection   
**Bold Venture**|  Recover Mana when successfully Deflecting |   
  
Alteration consists of spells like Cloud Step and Rock Solid. For Cloud Step, we'd suggest focusing on skills such as Concealed Observation and Thunder Strike. These will increase the damage you can do when performing an Unveiling Strike, where you can take an enemy by surprise.

For Rock Solid, Rock Mastery, Ironclad, and Bold Venture are particularly useful. With this combination of skills, when you're successful at Deflecting, you can recover Mana quickly, and take less damage for a short amount of time. With the Mana recovery and the Rock Mastery reducing the cooldown of the spell, you can get more use of Rock Solid in fights.
