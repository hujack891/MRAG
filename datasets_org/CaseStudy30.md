Q:How to defeat the Chen_Loong?

A:
Like the other Loongs in The New West, Chen favors using lightning magic, and is a much more caster-oriented opponent compared to the others. You can prepare to mitigate his attacks by making sure you've crafted the Loongscale Armor Set, are stocked up on Shock-Quelling Powder, and apply the Soak to your Gourd that increases shock resistance. 

While he's nowhere as strong as the other dragons you've faced, you don't want to get to cocky, or you may find his electric attacks peeling off more of your health than you can restore, even with Zhu Bajie helping out.

The old dragon can be pretty agile too, leaping away to float in the air before casting a variety of electric attacks. One of these includes sending out a flurry of small electric orbs at you, though they can be deflected with a quick staff spin.

He can also raise his hand up slowly to trigger a row of lightning bolts in the area, which will explode fairly fast.

Sometimes, he'll take to the air instead, and fly at you in a divebomb attack which will require you to dodge both the fly-by, and the resulting row of lightning strikes that follow his attack.

Another electric variation will have him performing an underhanded toss of anywhere between one and three small lightning orbs. They'll bounce along the water for a few hops, and then explode in a much wider area to damage you unless you can dodge to the side.

He can also shoot lightning directly out of his mouth in a beam of energy. This can happen both when he's on the ground in a quick straight burst right in front of him, or when floating above you in a quick sweep in front of him, and both need quick dodges to stop a quick attack.

While Chen Loong is highly susceptible to being staggered, he has a few tricks to stop you from pressing the attack for too long. His tail can be pretty impressive, and will use it to spin around and attack with it for two rotations, and then leap into the air to perform a delayed third electric slash.

He'll often vary this combo up making it hard to read, and either trick you into thinking he's preparing a cast before tail-whipping, or throwing more quick slashes in-between tail attacks -- or even just doing single hits.

The dragon won't just stop at wacking you with his tail up close, either. If he proclaims "To the deepest trench I dive!" Be ready for him to stick his tail in the ground, only for several giant electrified tails to sprout up in a cluster nearby. You'll need to quickly break off your attack and give them a wide berth, as they'll quickly perform a single huge spin attack all at once! 

![Wukong Bitter 10.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/2/2e/Wukong_Bitter_10.jpg)

Other times, he may only summon one smaller tail, but this one can expel its electrical energy in a projectile blast when the tail swings.

His strongest attack by far is when he jumps into the air with his green weapon, charging it with energy before crashing down with it. It will cause a huge electrical explosion when he lands, but then spread outward with several lighting strikes that cover a wide area. 

![Wukong Bitter 16.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/f/fc/Wukong_Bitter_16.jpg)

The second hit can be extremely tough to dodge, but using the Pillar Stance to get off the ground can soak the blow if you have stamina to spare (though it will probably still stun you). 

Remember that you also have Zhu Bajie as an ally in this fight, and while he won't be able to hold his attention for too long, but he can be useful at giving you some breathing room or interrupting attacks.

Since Chen Loong doesn't have a whole lot of health or armor, use everything in your arsenal to keep him staggered and unable to hit back whenever possible, and you can rush him down before the fight goes on too long and you start taking double damage too often. 

When he's defeated, Chen Loong will throw a bit of a tantrum, and you'll find he's not such a bad guy. He also seems to know Xu Dog, and claims only one of his celestial resurrection pills can ease his pains.

Warp back to the Yellow Wind Ridge to find the Xu Dog back in the cellar below the Crouching Tiger Temple.

Speak to him here, and he'll pass along a Special-made Bone-Strengthening Pellet for the poor old Loong. You'll also get the formula to make your own Fortifying Medicament for your trouble! 

![Wukong Bitter 20.jpg](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/black-myth-wukong/5/5c/Wukong_Bitter_20.jpg)

Return to Chen Loong (who now stands outside the shack by the water), and deliver the pellet to him. The old dragon will be overjoyed at your gift, and in return will pass along The Ruyi Scroll to you. He'll proclaim that he now has the strength to unseal the Painted Realm, where he and his fellow deities will now reside -- and you're invited!
