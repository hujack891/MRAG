  * **Magma Forged**
  * Equipped Effect: Moderately increases charging speed. 



Charface's Spirit allows you to take his form and plunge his large, fiery scimitar into the ground, causing lava to explode out and burn any nearby foes. Charface is a strong enemy, and so is his Spirit. Not only can you deal massive damage to the enemies around you, but having Charface equipped also speeds up your charging speed, allowing you to charge Heavy Attacks faster.
