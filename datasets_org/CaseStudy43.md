Q: What is the Best Mysticism Skills to Unlock?

A:
Skill Name | Description   
---|---  
**Stagnation**|  Extends duration of Immobilization on next attack (Stacks up to 5-10 times)   
**Evanescence**|  When enemies attack after being Immobilized, the duration increases along with the damage they take   
**Raging Flames**|  Focus generates each second you're within the Ring of Fire   
**Consolidation**|  Slowly recover health while in the Ring of Fire.   
  
You'll unlock Mysticism early on and be able to use Immobilize to stop enemies in their tracks. Skills like Stagnation, where you extend the duration of Immobilization the next time you use the spell are invaluable especially as they stack. 

Team this with Evanescence and you can extend the Immobilization once again, but also increase the damage they take once they try to attack. The goal for this category should be to try and do as much damage as possible and have the spell last as long as you can.

Later on, you'll also earn Ring of Fire, which will help you recover quicker and can be used to protect against the cold. Skills like Raging Flames and Consolidation are worth unlocking here, to help you recover and build Focus simultaneously so you can jump back into the action as you exit the ring.
