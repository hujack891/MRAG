Non-White's Bone Spikes attack allows him to leap forward and spin at the same time, getting close to targets quickly and hitting them. The immediate follow-up to this is he'll sprout thorns to stab an enemy, prolonging the attack. In the same way that Gangmou is useful for Poison Damage, so is the Non-White Spirit. Alongside the moderate buff to Poison Damage, you'll also get a moderate increase to Frost Damage, so aim for a two-pronged attack that allows you to inflict both elements.
