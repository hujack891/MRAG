  * **Frost Blade**
  * Equipped Effect: None



The Apramana Bat Spirit allows you to take the form of the bat, launching yourself up into the air and beating your wings, creating an X-shaped slice of frosty air to damage your target with. This can potentially freeze the target solid if you've dealt enough frost damage beforehand. This is a powerful attack, but the Apramana Bat is the only Spirit without an equipped effect, which is a bit of a downside for this Spirit.
