Q:What is the Best Staff Stances Skills to Unlock?

A:
Skill Name | Description   
---|---  
**Resolute Counterflow**|  Perform a Heavy Attack during a Light Attack combo to consume Focus Point and perform Resolute Strike.   
**Skyfall Strike**|  After Resolute Strike, perform another Heavy Attack consuming a Focus Point   
**Invigoration**|  Grants massive Focus when performing Resolute Strike   
**Exhilaration**|  Increases the Health recovery when consuming a Focus Point based on talent level   
**Versatility**|  Increases damage of Varied Combos   
  
The skills you choose in this category will depend on your stance preference but we'd argue that Smash Stance is the best. With the suggested skills, you'll unlock a new Heavy Attack at the end of a Light Attack combo. Adding Invigoration to the chain of Resolute Counterflow and Skyfall Strike will ensure you're building plenty of focus while completing those combos. 

The aim for the Staff Stances category is to get 20 points in there at least to eventually unlock Focus Attack IV and have 4 Focus Points you can build up at a time.
