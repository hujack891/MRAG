Q:Where is the Wukong Buddha's Eyeball 2 Location?

A:
The next Buddha's statue can be found along the right path in Squall Hideout. Along the right side of the area, you will find some rafters with Blazebones enemies. Pass the chest, head up, and kill them. Interact with the Buddha statue at the top.
