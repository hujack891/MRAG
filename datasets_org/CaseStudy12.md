Head back toward the Pagoda after activating the Outside the Pagoda Keeper's Shrine and take a right. Run to the end of the area on the right to open the chest and drop off the side of the cliff to the floor below. Turn left and fight your way to a small alcove, where you will encounter the Blade Monk Spirit. Defeat the Spirit and break the barrel it was guarding to collect the Awaken Wine Worm.
