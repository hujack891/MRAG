Q:What is the Best Foundation Skills to Unlock?

A:
Skill Name | Description   
---|---  
**Simian Agility**|  Moderately reduces stamina cost of Dodging   
**Robust Constitution**|  Each talent level moderately increases Maximum Health   
**Rampant Vigor**|  Increase maximum stamina   
**Effortless Finisher**|  More Focus when the Second move on Light Attack combo hits an enemy   
**Punishing Downpour**|  Light Attack Finisher deals extra Damage after six successful hits   
**Composure**|  Dodging doesn't interrupt Light Attack Combo   
  
Foundation Skills are full of useful abilities and we'd recommend focusing your Sparks in this category, especially at the start of the game. 

Robust Constitution and Rampant Vigor will give you boosts to your health and stamina respectively, helping you in those early fights. Similan Agility works well with Rampant Vigor, reducing the stamina cost of dodging, while you're already benefiting from an increase to max stamina. Being able to dodge consistently and worry less about stamina will get you out of some sticky situations.

Along with the suggested skills, we'd suggest unlocking skills that will allow you to complete combos without interruption, with more attack power on finishers, and those that build focus quickly.
