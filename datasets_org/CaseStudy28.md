Q: How to Get the Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang Spirit?

A:
Instead of finding Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang lurking somewhere waiting for a fight, you have to evolve this one from an existing Spirit you will have picked up in Chapter 1, [Baw-Li-Guh-Lang](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang_Spirit). Baw-Li-Guh-Lang can be found after reaching the Snake Trail Keeper's Shrine on Black Wind Mountain. Once you're there, run up the stairs on the right and take a left. You will come across a flimsy fence on the edge of a cliff on the left. Smash the fence and drop into the river below. Run to the right to find Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang.

Check out our [Baw-Li-Guh-Yang Spirit](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Baw-Li-Guh-Yang_Spirit "Baw-Li-Guh-Yang Spirit \(page does not exist\)") guide for more information on this Spirit! 

Defeating Baw-Li-Guh-Yang will provide you with his Spirit and an item called a **Tadpole**. Unlike the other Spirits that cost Will and eventually a Knot of Voidness to upgrade, Baw-Li-Guhh-Yang requires Tadpoles. There are six frog bosses in [Black Myth: Wukong](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong "Main Page"), and each one yields a Tadpole when defeated. 

**There is one frog boss in each chapter. You must defeat all of them to collect enough Tadpoles to fully upgrade Baw-Li-Guh-Yang and unlock Baw-Baw-Lang-Lang.**

Spirits can be upgraded at any Keeper's Shrine by selecting _Cultivate Spirits_!
