Q:What is the Celestial Birthstone Fragment?

A:
The Celestial Birthstone Fragment is one of the many [Curios](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Curios "Curios") items you can find in Black Myth: Wukong. Like the rest of these items, once found, it can be equipped from the Equipment menu. 

With the Celestial Birthstone Fragment equipped your enemies' four elemental Bane resistances will be completely ignored, allowing you to deal maximum damage. 

Curios items in Black Myth: Wukong can't be upgraded, so you can't increase their power or potency. Therefore, the item will stay at its current power throughout the game. If you want a better buff or something else to fit your build, you will need to switch it out.
