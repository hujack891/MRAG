Q:What is the Celestial Lotus Seeds?

A:
The Celestial Lotus Seeds are one of the many [Soaks](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Soaks "Soaks") you will find for your [Gourds](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Gourds "Gourds") in Black Myth: Wukong. They provide an extra healing boost on top of your Gourd if you have them equipped, allowing you to heal beyond what your Drink and Gourd allows. 

With the Celestial Lotus Seeds equipped, for a brief moment after using the gourd, slowly recovers a small amount of health. While this amount isn't anything great, it can be a nice addition to your basic healing.

Unlike the Drinks in the game and the Gourd itself, Soaks can't be upgraded at the Shen Monkey Vendor, so you are stuck with the potency of this buff. It can't be increased. So, if you want to switch to a more powerful buff, be sure to head back to the Shen Monkey Vendor.
