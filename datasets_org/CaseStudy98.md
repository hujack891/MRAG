  * **Heart Ripper**
  * Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Attack.



The Civet Sergeant's Spirit allows you to embody him long enough to hurl two blades straight into your foe's chest. This is a pretty decent attack that's further bolstered by the Civet Sergeant's equipped effect that increases your attack power. Having more attack power is always helpful in Black Myth: Wukong, making the Civet Sergeant a worthwhile Spirit to pour resources into upgrading.
