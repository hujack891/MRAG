  * **Rolling Ball**
  * Equipped Effect: Slightly increases Movement Speed. 



The Centipede Guai's Spirit allows you to take the form of the Centipede and perform the rolling ball move that you will have experienced during your fight. This move hits hard and can easily stagger foes, giving you a chance to land your own combo before they recover. Its equipped effect increases your Movement Speed as well, making it a great Spirit to equip when taking on challenges like the Iron Ball in the Flaming Mountains.
