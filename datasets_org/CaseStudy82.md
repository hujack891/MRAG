Q:Where is the Centipede Guai Location?

A:
The Centipede Guai can be found in a massive pit full of skulls called the Bonevault. To reach the Bonevault, head to the Middle Hollow Keeper's Shrine in the Webbed Hollow. Drop down the wooden platform beside the Shrine and head straight forward to drop into the pit of bones.
