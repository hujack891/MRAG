The Awaken Wine Worm in [Chapter 2](https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Chapter_2_-_Yellow_Sand,_Desolate_Dusk) is in a small shack just above the area where you will fight the First Prince of Flowing Sands. You can see the glowing vase from outside the shack, but you will need to drop down and follow the path to the left to get behind the wall and smash the vase.
