If you've got to Chapter 3 and encountered a Clay Vajra, you'll know they're a walking fire machine, and who wouldn't want to use that as an attack? Flames of Doom will see the Clay Vajra shoot fire from its knees in a wide arc, meaning you can deal with groups or cover a large area when attacking. The buff you'll receive for having this Spirit equipped is burn resistance, so it's also great to use against enemies that deliver fire attacks themselves.
