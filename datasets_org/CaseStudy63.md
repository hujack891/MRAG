Q:Where is the Wukong Buddha's Eyeball 5 Location?

A:
A little further on, on the left side of the area, you will see a covered area of the cave with some more Blazebones. This is before the Rockrest Flat Shrine. On your left, there will be a path curving up to another caved area.

Continue up the hill and you will find the Mother of Stones boss. Either fight her, or leave her for later. Take a right where the light is shining through the cave at the top, and you will find the Buddha statue with the eyeball on the cliff edge.
