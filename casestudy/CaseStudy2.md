Jiao-Loong of Waves has a limited moveset, so you can quickly pick up on the attack patterns. It will mainly use its tale to try and whip you, either by spinning or flipping around to catch you with it.

As well as this, it will lunge and swipe at you, and occasionally sidestep or leap up and pounce on you in an attempt to bite you. With all of these attacks, simply dodging or jumping back should be enough to keep you out of harm's way.

You can generally stay close to this boss, but just watch out for its roar that will stun you for a few seconds. To combat Jiao-Loong of Waves, you'll want to use heavy attacks. It's not so steady on its feet, so you can easily knock it over or at least temporarily stun it. This will give you longer periods of time to give it a beatdown without interruption. If you use the Plantain Fan here, it'll be constantly knocked down on the floor, giving you even more time to attack.

When its health has been knocked down past the halfway mark, it will start to dive into the water where you won't be able to reach it. It will move underneath the surface to try and dive up and attack you. Look for where the water is rippling to work out where it'll emerge.

It will dive in and out a few times, then its huge tail will appear from the water to try and hit you. This will appear almost tentacle-like, and there can be overlap which means you're dodging more than one at once. 

Thankfully, with a limited range of attacks and a fairly straightforward way to avoid them, Jiao-Loong of Waves shouldn't require too much to take it down. Don't feel the need to conserve your spells during this fight; take advantage of them to quickly take down this miniboss.
