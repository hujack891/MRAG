Q: Where is Clay Vajra located?
A:
Clay Vajra is a large, four-legged creature that can be found guarding the entrance to the New Thunderclap Temple.
You will find him lurking in the courtyard outside the steps leading to the main temple.
The main temple is near the back of the complex, so you will have to fight your way through from the entrance to reach him.
